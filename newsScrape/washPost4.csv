"The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday an “unknown party” had hacked its official account on the social media platform X to promote bitcoin, the latest of multiple hacks used to push cryptocurrencies.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday an “unknown party” had hacked its official account on the social media platform X to promote bitcoin, the latest of multiple hacks used to push cryptocurrencies. The account @SECGov posted on the platform, formerly known as Twitter, that the agency had approved bitcoin exchange-traded funds for listing on national exchanges. The posting occurred shortly after 4 p.m. and attracted millions of views before the SEC wrested control back and declared that the earlier statement was false. By that time, the initial post had been reported by some media outlets. SEC chair Gary Gensler later   that the agency’s “account was compromised, and an unauthorized tweet was posted. The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products.” His post followed an SEC statement that the hacker had taken control for a brief period. “The SEC will work with law enforcement and our partners across government to investigate the matter and determine appropriate next steps relating to both the unauthorized access and any related misconduct,” said spokesperson Stephanie Allen. Bitcoin backers have asked the SEC for permission to list such funds repeatedly, since they would give investors a more regulated way to participate in the crypto markets. The false post briefly drove a  in bitcoin prices, so that anyone with knowledge of the scam could have reaped a major profit. The hijack was also notable because the account was not only a source for official news but one branded by X with a silver check mark, meaning that it had been verified as a prominent and important government account. It is unclear whether such accounts include special security arrangements, but it would be surprising if the SEC account did not include at least a minimal form of two-factor authentication. The hack follows that of smaller government accounts and those of some accounts with gold checks, which are given to private organizations, over the past few weeks. Since those accounts are also likely to have two-factor authentication, some security experts believe the spate of hijacks suggest a broad vulnerability or new technique is in play. X did not respond to an email seeking comment.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7SHNVRQGPVON5ZFJYQEYKXSEA.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7SHNVRQGPVON5ZFJYQEYKXSEA.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7SHNVRQGPVON5ZFJYQEYKXSEA.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7SHNVRQGPVON5ZFJYQEYKXSEA.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7SHNVRQGPVON5ZFJYQEYKXSEA.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q7SHNVRQGPVON5ZFJYQEYKXSEA.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/09/sec-hack-x-crypto/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 19:37:00,
"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had surgery last month after a prostate cancer diagnosis, officials disclosed Tuesday, detailing for the first time what condition led to serious medical complications and a lengthy hospitalization that he kept secret for days from the White House, Congress and the American public. Austin’s condition was announced by the Pentagon in   attributed to John Maddox and Gregory Chesnut, doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. They said the retired Army general, 70, was diagnosed with cancer in December after routine screening and underwent a “minimally invasive surgical procedure” known as a prostatectomy, in which all or part of the organ is removed, while under general anesthesia. He was admitted Jan. 1 after developing complications from the surgery and remains a patient there. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had surgery last month after a prostate cancer diagnosis, officials disclosed Tuesday, detailing for the first time what condition led to serious medical complications and a lengthy hospitalization that he kept secret for days from the White House, Congress and the American public. Austin’s condition was announced by the Pentagon in   attributed to John Maddox and Gregory Chesnut, doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. They said the retired Army general, 70, was diagnosed with cancer in December after routine screening and underwent a “minimally invasive surgical procedure” known as a prostatectomy, in which all or part of the organ is removed, while under general anesthesia. He was admitted Jan. 1 after developing complications from the surgery and remains a patient there. As with his hospitalization, Austin withheld the existence of his cancer diagnosis from Biden and other key administration officials, the White House acknowledged — this time for weeks, raising new questions about his transparency with the president. The two men, whom administration officials describe as close, had spoken by phone Saturday evening while Austin convalesced at Walter Reed. But officials said Biden did not learn until Tuesday, shortly before it was revealed publicly, what condition precipitated the defense secretary’s medical crisis. John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, conceded during a news briefing, “We all recognize that this didn’t unfold the way it should have.” “It’s not good,” he added. “It’s certainly not good.” While Austin’s cancer was detected early and his prognosis is excellent, his doctors said, he developed nausea and pain in his abdomen, hip and leg. He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, and additional evaluation determined abdominal fluids had impaired the function of his small intestines, prompting doctors to drain his stomach with a tube through his nose, the statement says. Officials had said he was in “extreme pain” when taken by ambulance to Walter Reed. “He has progressed steadily throughout his stay,” the doctors said in the statement. “His infection has cleared. He continues to make progress and we anticipate a full recovery although this can be a slow process. During this stay, Secretary Austin never lost consciousness and never underwent general anesthesia.” Austin, known to be intensely private and spotlight-averse, required about a week in intensive care, officials said. The Pentagon publicly disclosed his hospitalization late Friday — four days after he was admitted. An uproar ensued when it was learned the Defense Department had notified Biden and the White House only one day before that. Asked why the secretary had been so reluctant to disclose the nature of his medical situation, the Pentagon press secretary, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said the matter was “intensely personal.” While Austin is back on the job from his hospital room, defense officials already have started to make adjustments to account for his condition. He was due to meet later this week with the Bulgarian defense minister, Todor Tagarev, at the Pentagon. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks is now planning to do so instead, two defense officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Critics, including political adversaries and allies, have admonished the administration for its secrecy, with many noting the calamity that could have occurred with the United States actively, if indirectly, involved in two wars and the recent   on U.S. forces deployed in the Middle East. Internally, some frustrated officials have complained as well, saying the handling of the incident showed “ ” on Austin’s part. Kirby said the president was informed of Austin’s cancer by Jeff Zients, the White House chief of staff. Biden, Kirby said, had been unaware that Austin transferred his authorities to Hicks, as he underwent surgery Dec. 22. Once the Pentagon publicly disclosed Austin’s hospitalization at the very end of the workweek, its initial   was vague and obfuscated what had occurred, referring to the surgery as an “elective medical procedure.” The vast majority of surgical procedures are considered elective, which means they can be scheduled in advance. When hospitals were inundated with patients during the   pandemic, doctors warned that thousands of patients were suffering as a result of delayed elective procedures such as hernia repair and spinal fusion. Ryder, when asked about this Tuesday, said he would “defer to medical officials” on whether that was an appropriate characterization. Nitin Yerram, director of urological oncology at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, said most cancer surgeries are considered elective, a term that’s often misunderstood. “We tend to think more of tummy tucks and cosmetic surgery,” Yerram said. “However, all ‘elective’ means is it’s a scheduled surgery with work-up done before that. The opposite of elective is emergent or trauma situation, such as a car crash, where it’s not a scheduled procedure.” White House officials have repeatedly stated in recent days that Austin’s job is not in jeopardy despite his failure to disclose such a serious illness. “We have complete confidence in the secretary,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. Similarly, the Pentagon has said that Austin does not intend to resign and that no one working for him has offered to do so, either. Some Republicans in Congress have said Austin should step down. Rep. Matt Rosendale (Mont.) announced Monday his plan to introduce   against the defense secretary. Parallel internal reviews launched by the White House and the Pentagon — into the delegation of authority across Cabinet agencies and the handling of Austin’s hospitalization, respectively — raised the possibility that officials may withhold additional details about recent events while those investigations unfold. Ryder, in response to questions about what transpired in recent days, made repeated reference to the 30-day Defense Department review that’s underway. That inquiry was ordered by  , Austin’s chief of staff who has faced scrutiny for her role amid the scandal. Speaking to reporters Monday, Ryder blamed the breakdown in notification protocol on Magsamen having contracted the flu, causing her to miss work. It remains unclear whether she delegated any responsibilities to subordinates while she was ill. Ryder said it was Magsamen who on Thursday ultimately notified Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, that Austin was in the hospital. It also was disclosed previously that, in addition to Magsamen, at least three other senior Defense Department officials — Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Lt. Gen. Ronald Clark, Austin’s senior military assistant; and Ryder, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman — were aware of the secretary’s medical situation before the White House was told. Ryder said Tuesday that he has not talked to Austin this year. Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.), the Senate Armed Services Committee’s top Republican, issued a statement after Tuesday’s announcement saying that “there must be accountability.” He appeared to take aim at Magsamen, saying, “An internal review — ordered by the same Chief of Staff who played a part in this crisis — is woefully inadequate.” Ryder, asked about that point Monday, said that “no one has more interest in making sure that we can learn from this and ensure that we’re doing what we need to do than the folks that are carrying out those responsibilities.” The administration has been at a loss to explain why top officials did not interrogate the matter fully once it was discovered the defense secretary had concealed his hospitalization. Five days passed from the time the White House was notified that Austin was at Walter Reed to when Biden found out about the prostate cancer diagnosis, an indication that officials either hadn’t asked him or he had declined to share the information. “I hear you,” Jean-Pierre said during questions from reporters. “That is something that we are going to get a sense of in this process. That’s why they’re going to do a review. That’s why the Pentagon is going to do a review. The fact that the diagnosis was a form of cancer made it all the more surprising that Biden did not know earlier. The president has put a large amount of focus in recent years on “ ,” and speaking about cancer has been a key venue for connection with voters. His son Beau, who served with and befriended Austin when they were both in Iraq, died of brain cancer in 2015. Prostate cancer ranks behind skin cancer as the most common form in men. Research has found that nearly all men with early stage prostate cancer  , regardless of how they are treated. Experts on the treatment say the prostate can be removed with robotic equipment that does not require making a large incision. Surgery indicates that the cancer has not spread and that the patient has a strong prognosis. The White House has said Biden remains focused on Austin’s recovery and looks forward to having him back at the Pentagon as soon as possible. Kirby, speaking to reporters, sought to keep the focus there Tuesday. “We all want to wish him the very best,” he said. “I mean, this is sadly, this is a disease that affects many millions of American men, particularly at that stage in life. And the key is early diagnosis. … We’re all going to learn a whole heck of a lot of lessons from this past week. One of the lessons I hope that everybody takes away is the value of early screening.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL3WTGGRKMI6ZCDL353BQPJDH4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL3WTGGRKMI6ZCDL353BQPJDH4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL3WTGGRKMI6ZCDL353BQPJDH4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL3WTGGRKMI6ZCDL353BQPJDH4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL3WTGGRKMI6ZCDL353BQPJDH4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KL3WTGGRKMI6ZCDL353BQPJDH4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/09/lloyd-austin-prostate-cancer/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 20:59:00,
"This summer, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a pilgrimage to India to discuss the artificial intelligence revolution with a towering figure: Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Altman had   a day earlier for saying it was “totally hopeless” for a few smart Indian engineers to compete with his company, which had built the dominant ChatGPT. But Modi  warmly, as they discussed how AI could change the lives of India’s 1.4 billion citizens and bonded over their shared vegetarian diets. This summer, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a pilgrimage to India to discuss the artificial intelligence revolution with a towering figure: Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But Modi  warmly, as they discussed how AI could change the lives of India’s 1.4 billion citizens and bonded over their shared vegetarian diets. A photo of the meeting had all the hallmarks of a state visit: Altman and the prime minister smiling at each other, perched in matching upholstered chairs. Outside the photo’s frame was the shrewd but self-effacing executive who orchestrated the summit:  OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs. Makanju has engineered Altman’s transformation from a start-up darling into the AI industry’s ambassador — designing his outreach like a diplomatic mission, towing the CEO across 25 cities and six continents on a four-week tour marking his debut on the global stage. Drawing on experience in national security during the Obama administration, she has been by Altman’s side as he huddled with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, Israeli President Isaac Herzog and  . When global leaders were rattled during Altman’s dramatic five-day ouster in November, it was Makanju fielding their messages, reassuring them that the company would continue to exist. great conversation with   discussing india's incredible tech ecosystem and how the country can benefit from ai. really enjoyed all my meetings with people in the  .  “She’s de facto the foreign minister of one of the most important companies in the world,” said Michael McFaul, who served as the United States ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration and is the director of Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, where Makanju sits on the advisory council. Tech companies traditionally shun Washington until trouble emerges, asking for forgiveness rather than permission. Mark Zuckerberg   after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when the political consulting firm gained unauthorized access to the platform to harvest user data. The testimony was more than 14 years after he founded Facebook, now Meta. But Makanju, a veteran of SpaceX’s Starlink and Facebook, has turned the Silicon Valley lobbying blueprint on its head. Rather than waiting for scandal like Zuckerberg or   like SpaceX founder Elon Musk, she has spent years courting policymakers with a more solicitous message: Regulate us. Thanks to her strategy, Altman has emerged as a rare tech executive lawmakers from both parties appear to trust. As Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer moves closer to AI regulation — unveiling a bipartisan framework in the “near future,” Schumer spokeswoman Allison Biasotti said — he has consulted Altman and other OpenAI executives. Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.) said in a December Post Live interview that he likes Altman and that the company is “going to continue to be an influential player in AI” following his return to the helm. Other regulatory threats are looming, including the European Commission  this week that it is reviewing whether Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI could be subject to a merger review. The United Kingdom has already   into whether the deal squashes competition. Makanju positions the company’s activities as education, rather than as lobbying — an AI school for curious politicians. “Because we’re not pursuing a specific legislative and regulatory outcome, it’s not really traditional lobbying,” she said in late summer over breakfast at Cheryl’s Global Soul, a restaurant near her Brooklyn home. “We really want to be a technical partner to regulators.” But OpenAI, which has taken billions of dollars in investment from Microsoft, is not a neutral tutor. Its intimate seat with policymakers has bestowed Altman a rare form of influence. And the company’s critics are wary that a campaign playing out in closed door meetings sets the stage for regulatory capture. “They’ve been very effective,” said Merve Hickok, president and research director of the Center for AI and Digital Policy, which filed a complaint against the company with the Federal Trade Commission . “Whether that is good or bad for public safety, public interest, is another question.” A multilingual third-culture kid raised across four continents, Makanju’s childhood was a training in cultural diplomacy. Her Nigerian father received a scholarship to study medicine in the former U.S.S.R., through what Makanju calls effectively a Soviet “soft power” program. “They would be trained in the Soviet Union and then they could bring communism back to their home countries,” she said. He met her mother in a bar popular with Soviet students trying to practice English. Makanju spent much of her early childhood with her grandparents in St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad, where she said few residents had seen other Black people. She bounced around Lagos, Nigeria, Germany, Arizona and Kuwait before she attended high school in Texas, moving with her mother, an engineer struggling to find work amid the Cold War. When she first came to the United States at age 10, she had never seen an ad or tried breakfast cereal. She became obsessed with a spot for Cheerios that showed milk, strawberries and a “magical substance” flowing out of a box. She and her younger sister saved up their $0.25 allowances for weeks so they could buy the biggest box to open like in the commercial. “Some weird dry things came out,” Makanju said. “It was truly at the time one of the most incredibly disappointing experiences.” Makanju was schooled in the art of statecraft during nearly a decade in the Obama administration, where she worked in a number of national security roles. She was a special adviser to Biden on Europe and served as the director for Russia on the White House National Security Council in 2014, as the Obama administration grappled with Russia’s  McFaul said he was “blown away” by Makanju’s deep knowledge about Russian affairs and fluency in the language when they met during Obama’s presidency. “She’s a very sophisticated citizen of the world, and she’s dealt with the bad guys,” McFaul said. Concerns about the Russian interference are what drew her to a job at Facebook. Government officials spent years working on social media election interference, Makanju said. But she spent “almost no time” talking to people within Silicon Valley companies about the problem. “One of the things that I most regret about working in government is not spending more time with industry,” she said. Makanju initially worked on the company’s election safeguards and later shifted to a role determining Meta’s policies for political advertising around the world, at times fielding questions from policymakers increasingly interested in regulating online spots. In 2021, as OpenAI was beginning to think about how to deploy its AI models, its executives realized they needed to win over the public and policymakers, said Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer. After working on global policy for Starlink and having navigated years of scandals at Facebook, Makanju was the perfect person for the job. At OpenAI, Makanju saw a chance to change convention by anticipating crisis with a strategy. OpenAI was virtually unknown, and its AI tools were not generally available to the public. The blank slate, she felt, offered a chance to build trust preemptively. “We could start doing this much earlier in the process, start shaping their thinking, helping people understand the technology,” Makanju said. Makanju spent her first day using GPT-3, amazed by the technology’s capabilities. She was struck by how the tool could’ve sped up her work in government, using it to quickly evaluate, for example, how Russia had discussed the expansion of NATO over time. But she also saw its potential downfalls. She was concerned it could be abused by authoritarian regimes to engage in mass surveillance of citizens; she imagined governments using the technology to transcribe conversations or scan phone calls. Makanju initially had no direct reports, and focused on building personal relationships with policymakers already working on the technology, including the AI caucus in the U.S. Congress and Brussels, where work was already underway on the E.U. AI Act. The company was relatively unknown in Washington, where AI hearings were sparsely attended and issues like antitrust and social media policy dominated discussions about tech regulation. That all changed about a year later, when the company  . “Her challenge back then was to get anyone to talk to us,” Murti said. “Now everybody wants to talk to us.” The chatbot’s release sparked an international panic in policy circles. Lawmakers in the European Union rushed to update the legislation years-in-the making to account for generative AI. Policymakers in the United States  to get up to speed, hosting   and hearings on the technology. In   Altman laid out a plan to form a new government agency charged with licensing AI models and to require independent audits of technology. Makanju prepped Altman for the grilling, coaching the green CEO on the structure of congressional hearings and the cadence of the conversation before his first Capitol Hill appearance. “Some people were surprised that we were bringing him to the Hill at that stage,” she said. “This is the time to be speaking with lawmakers and working with them as proactively as possible, verses waiting until there’s a crisis.” It worked. Altman received an unusually warm reception from lawmakers, as Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called his willingness to commit to action “night and day” compared to other tech executives. That image of Altman faces challenges, amid   the E.U. AI Act and others   in the Middle East. Relations could further strain as legislation begins to solidify in the United States. “If they don’t like the regulation that comes in or they say that’s not what we meant, then people start to get upset,” said Katie Harbath, a former Facebook policy director who hired Makanju. Promoting Altman as a statesman for AI could also backfire. Zuckerberg — who has since become a punching bag for global leaders — provides a cautionary tale. In 2015, the Facebook CEO posted pictures of himself  and admiring   — a signal of the company’s growing interest in reaching people in India who were coming online. Instead, Zuckerberg was criticized for targeting India’s poor with a subpar version of the web. India now has the most Facebook users in the world, but the company has been accused of bowing to government censorship and fomenting hate. Makanju finds the comparisons between Zuckerberg and Altman amusing. Unlike Facebook, OpenAI does not have a massive public policy apparatus orchestrating Altman’s moves, she argues. The entire trip was planned by her and another colleague. And because OpenAI has a distinct corporate structure and has been thinking about risks since its inception, it won’t make the same mistakes. “We genuinely believe that our mission, our fiduciary duty, is to humanity,” she said. “And we’re not going to do things with our business that we think are contrary to the mission.” Patricia Gruver-Barr, co-founder of the Tech Diplomacy Network, warned that OpenAI’s diplomatic mission could give the company outsize influence on the world stage, fomenting regulations that favor OpenAI over smaller companies and upstarts. “We’ve seen this power asymmetry emerge between the nation state and these big tech companies — a handful of companies in Silicon Valley in particular — that have more geopolitical power than any company or industry has had in the past,” said Gruver-Barr, a former science attaché for the British and Québec governments. Amid the growing clamor in Congress to regulate AI, the company is bringing in reinforcements. After years of outreach to lawmakers, OpenAI in fall 2023 disclosed its first in-house lobbyist, and reported that it is working with global law firm DLA Piper, according to federal disclosures. OpenAI to date has not advocated for or against any specific bill, Makanju says, but she anticipates that will change in 2024, especially with the Schumer effort that is underway. Makanju’s team is also growing around the world, with more than 20 people in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and Brazil. Makanju says it’s in the public interest for politicians to gather a host of perspectives about AI, including from industry. “The companies that are building these tools know the most about them,” she said. And that’s why they should keep talking to her.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HLZFYO6GC24UZVYQJOEELCYKE_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HLZFYO6GC24UZVYQJOEELCYKE_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HLZFYO6GC24UZVYQJOEELCYKE_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HLZFYO6GC24UZVYQJOEELCYKE_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HLZFYO6GC24UZVYQJOEELCYKE_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HLZFYO6GC24UZVYQJOEELCYKE_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HLZFYO6GC24UZVYQJOEELCYKE_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440&impolicy=high_res 1440w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/09/openai-anna-makanju-ai-regulation/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 17:32:00,

WASHINGTON — John Carlson scored the game-winner with 53 seconds left in regulation, and the Washington Capitals beat the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 on Sunday. The Capitals’ fourth line made all the difference in the win. Nicolas Aube-Kubel had a goal and two assists, Nic Dowd had a goal and an assist and Beck Malenstyn added an assist. Dylan Strome also scored for Washington, which ended a two-game slide. “The fourth line was unbelievable all game, so credit to them. They got the ice time tonight, and they deserved it. Not only just did they get the goals, but they got the chances, too,” Strome said. “They were great defensively and not enough good things to say about them. They’re a really good line and hard to play against.” Kevin Fiala scored twice and Adrian Kempe also had a goal for the Kings, who have lost five in a row. “That’s not acceptable,” Fiala said. “We’re going to make sure next game we’re going to do everything we can to win. We just have to be better.” Aube-Kubel tied the game at 3 with his fourth goal of the season at 8:36 of the third period. Then Carlson beat Cam Talbot from the point to put Washington up. “I just tried to find one through there,” Carlson, who also had an assist, said of his game-winner. “I wasn’t really expecting to score, but I’ll take it all the time.” After a game-opening goal from Dowd early in the second, Los Angeles tilted the ice heavily in their favor and outshot Washington 18-11 in the middle frame, going up 2-1 thanks to Kempe and Fiala. In response to the Kings’ surge, Capitals coach Spencer Carbery changed the lines and put Alex Ovechkin, Strome and Max Pacioretty together. It paid off, as Strome tied the game, but Fiala restored the lead once again for L.A. on the power play at 1:01 of the third. “Coming back to the bench after that penalty kill goal. ... we’re kind of looking at each other like, ‘There’s no way we’re going to lose this game based off of that bounce,’” Dowd said. “I think we played too well, and we’ve had a long stretch and it’s been tough. We’ve lost guys to injuries, and guys are trying to find their game, whatever it is.” Darcy Kuemper stopped 38 of 41 shots in the win. Pacioretty picked up an assist for his first point with the Capitals, and Ovechkin, who was a game-time decision, extended his point streak to five games.

"EDMONTON, Alberta — Zach Hyman had his third hat trick of the season and fourth in the NHL to help the Edmonton Oilers win their seventh straight game, 3-1 over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday night. Stuart Skinner made 29 saves to help the Oilers improve to 20-15-1 and move into eighth place in the Western Conference. They have overcome a 5-12-1 start by going 15-3-0 in their last 18. EDMONTON, Alberta — Zach Hyman had his third hat trick of the season and fourth in the NHL to help the Edmonton Oilers win their seventh straight game, 3-1 over the Ottawa Senators on Saturday night. Stuart Skinner made 29 saves to help the Oilers improve to 20-15-1 and move into eighth place in the Western Conference. They have overcome a 5-12-1 start by going 15-3-0 in their last 18. Hyman completed the hat trick on a power play with 2:50 to go off a feed from Connor McDavid. “I’m doing the same thing. (They’re) just going in a little bit more this year,” said Hyman, who has 25 goals in 35 games this season as he attempts to eclipse his career best of 36 goals last season. “(There are) some pretty good players who make plays every single game, and I’m very fortunate to be playing with them.” Evan Bouchard assisted on all three goals. “You can’t really say too many good things about him,” Bouchard said about Hyman. “He is all over the ice. He does it defensively, works down low, puts his body on the line beside the net, and he is getting rewarded for it. Everybody in the room is happy to see it.” Kris Knoblauch became the first coach in NHL history to have two seven-game winning streaks in his first 25 games in the position. “I had no idea,” Knoblauch said. “I’m happy the team’s winning and playing well and it was only a matter of time before they started winning games, no matter what my message was. Hopefully we’ve got many more seven-game winning streaks.” Parker Kelly scored for Ottawa, and Anton Forsberg made 43 saves. The Senators have lost three straight and four of five to fall to 14-21-0. “I thought for the most part we were playing well and had a couple of unlucky breaks,” Kelly said. “We just have to find a way to keep playing a full 60, that’s kind of what we’re missing right now and it’s on all of us to be better.” Hyman opened the scoring on a power play with 1:52 left in the second. Bouchard sent a long shot through traffic that Hyman tipped past goalie Hyman made it 2-0 at 2:36 of the third. Forsberg got a piece of a wrist shot from the top of the circle by Hyman, only to have it trickle behind him into the net. Kelly ended Skinner’s shutout bid with 4:58 to play off a scramble in front of the net. The goal was originally waved off because of goaltender interference, but that decision was overturned by video review. Edmonton outshot Ottawa 15-8 in the scoreless first period, highlighted by the Oilers killing Evander Kane’s double-minor assessed for high-sticking Claude Giroux.

"Each night was the same. From his home in California, Fadi Sckak would dial his mother, Zahra, who was sheltered with her brother-in-law amid the rubble and tank fire in Gaza City’s besieged Sabra neighborhood. Often, he’d have to call more than 60 times before a connection was made and she was able to assure her son that, yes, she was still alive. Each night was the same. From his home in California, Fadi Sckak would dial his mother, Zahra, who was sheltered with her brother-in-law amid the rubble and tank fire in Gaza City’s besieged Sabra neighborhood. Often, he’d have to call more than 60 times before a connection was made and she was able to assure her son that, yes, she was still alive. Fadi’s father, Abedella, had died on Nov. 26. Eight days earlier, the 56-year-old had been struck in the calf by what the family believes was a stray Israeli bullet as the couple fled what remained of their home for the past 15 years. Without medical care, Abedella’s condition steadily deteriorated. First his legs went numb. He stopped talking. And then, he was gone. Late last month, in an act of desperation, Fadi Sckak, 25, contacted the news media to make  . Aided by the Arab American Civil Rights League, Sckak, a business student at San José State University, was then connected with a group of American military veterans who specialize in coordinating humanitarian evacuations from war zones. They were moved by the story, particularly because one of his two brothers, Ragi, is an infantry soldier in the U.S. Army who was deployed in South Korea as their parents’ crisis unfolded. What ensued was an extraordinary rescue operation, executed deep within the bombed-out Palestinian enclave after several days of intensive negotiations between the U.S. and Israeli governments. At the urging of White House officials and other key figures in Washington, senior Israeli officials approved Zahra Sckak’s extraction along with her brother-in-law Farid, a U.S. citizen, and supported their unimpeded passage to the border with Egypt, where they crossed to safety on Dec. 31. The daring daytime mission was performed by a small team of volunteers who shuttled them south through the Gaza hellscape. It was conducted without incident, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to elaborate, citing concerns for the safety of those involved. No shots were fired. In an interview, Zahra Sckak, 44, called the journey “terrifying.” She declined to identify her location, fearful that doing so would put her life in jeopardy once more, but said she is receiving medical care and gradually recovering. Sckak expressed gratitude to her son Fadi, who “told me not to worry,” and acknowledged that it has been difficult to reconcile all that had to transpire for her to leave Gaza. “It’s like, something big happened,” she said, “but I didn’t know anything about it. It’s unbelievable.” This account is based on interviews with 11 people familiar with the Sckak family’s ordeal, and efforts by the United States and Israel to facilitate last month’s secretive operation. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the still-sensitive details about how the two governments, motivated by the plight of a deployed American soldier, intervened to save his loved ones. The Associated Press   that Zahra Sckak and her brother-in-law had safely made it out of Gaza. The Israeli government did not respond to requests for comment. Senior U.S. officials have been guarded when discussing the operation, which occurred as hundreds of other American citizens are believed to be stranded in Gaza amid Israel’s punishing military campaign. Begun after   militants staged a brazen cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200, the Israeli offensive — which is backed by Washington — has killed more than 22,800 people, most of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Spokespeople at the White House, Pentagon and State Department declined to address most questions about the rescue or make those directly involved available for interviews. But four U.S. officials said the matter was closely tracked by senior leaders in Washington and the Middle East. “While there are many Americans still at risk, and our government is paying close attention to their situation and doing everything we can to get them back, this opportunity presented itself,” said one of the officials. “We did everything we could to get this soldier’s family back to safety. We’re lucky to have worked with all of the interagency and partners to have a successful outcome.” Administration officials have emphasized that no U.S. troops were ever in Gaza during the rescue. At the White House on Thursday, John Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, described the operation as “part and parcel of an ongoing effort that we have had working with Israeli counterparts and the Egyptians to allow for safe passage of Americans.” A State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, told reporters that the U.S. government played “more of a liaison role.” The United States, he said, keeps in touch with Americans who want to leave, and has assisted 1,300 citizens, family members and lawful permanent residents since the war began. Alicia Nieves, a legal advocate with the Arab American Civil Rights League who has assisted the Sckak family, said that soon after Israel began its military campaign in Gaza, Zahra and Abedella Sckak, who lived for a time in the United States, applied through the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem for authorization to cross into Egypt. By the time Zahra and Farid, her brother-in-law, were approved for departure in early December, Nieves said, Abedella Sckak was dead. “It’s almost like a black box, how it worked,” she added. “And there are still people, a handful that we know of, that still can’t get on the [departure] list as Americans.” For Alex Plitsas, an Army veteran and member of the   (SOAA), the group that helped connect U.S. and Israeli officials who coordinated the extraction, the mission evoked the celebrated World War II film “Saving Private Ryan,” in which a team of American troops is dispatched to pull out a young soldier from the fighting in Normandy after his three brothers were killed in combat. “I’m like, oh, God, this poor kid, his father’s dead, his mother’s all that’s left, she’s trapped — we’ve got to get her the hell out of there,” Plitsas said. “That’s what went through my brain.” The volunteers who drove the Sckaks out of Gaza are associates of SOAA, he added. Ragi Sckak, the soldier, said in an interview that he had approached his Army superiors in South Korea to ask for help evacuating his parents from Gaza but was directed to what he characterized as unhelpful immigration documents. As a junior soldier, he said, he didn’t feel empowered to escalate his request. Everything changed once his brother’s story appeared in the national news in late December. He was called into the office of Lt. Col. Lloyd Wohlschlegel, his battalion commander, and put on a call with a more senior military official who said the White House was pursuing options for extracting his mother from Gaza. “I was like: Finally,” Ragi Sckak recalled. Plitsas, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, contacted an aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — a professional acquaintance, he said — to apprise the Israeli government of the Sckaks’ situation. Army Col. Steve Gabavics, who is based at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, made contact with Israel’s Defense Ministry. Brett McGurk, a senior White House official with extensive connections in the Middle East, also got involved. McGurk, according to people familiar with his role in the negotiations, emphasized to the Israeli government that the Biden administration supported efforts to evacuate the Sckaks and urged his counterparts to prioritize the case. Andrew P. Miller, the deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, was actively involved, too. He emailed Fadi Sckak, the soldier’s brother, a few days before the rescue to inform him of a strategy that was coming together. “The current plan is that your mother and uncle will be picked up … and taken to Rafah Border crossing for transit into Egypt,” said the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. “This is all being coordinated with the IDF,” shorthand for the Israel Defense Forces, he said. In his email, Miller noted that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo would interview Zahra Sckak for a nonimmigrant visa. An immigrant visa, he said, could be obtained through a separate process. “Please let us know what she is thinking,” Miller wrote. On Dec. 24, Lt. Gen. Michael Fenzel, a senior American military official assigned to coordinate with Israeli and Palestinian officials, signed a letter for Israeli authorities verifying the Sckaks’ relationship to a U.S. service member. Other senior officials at Army headquarters, including departing Army Staff director Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt,  and personnel in Army Secretary Christine Wormuth’s office, also took measures to ensure there were no administrative roadblocks. In Gaza, Zahra Sckak’s physical condition was worsening. A preexisting knee injury limited her ability to walk, and she’d become dehydrated, exacerbating an infection she had developed while sheltering in a crowded apartment building. Ben Clay, a former Special Forces soldier working on the case with other military veterans, sent her instructions for how to distill and purify water from non-potable sources such as toilet tanks. The family members’ eventual transit out of Gaza and through the border with Egypt required multiple attempts, those familiar with the operation said. The first was cut short because of a miscommunication about the approved window for their travel. The scarcity of fuel was another obstacle. When the team of volunteers delivered Zahra Sckaks and her brother-in-law to Gaza’s border crossing at Rafah, the gate was closed, forcing them to stay the night nearby. When they returned the following day, Fadi Sckak said his mother had to “make a scene,” shouting in English at Palestinian officials who questioned how she and her brother-in-law had obtained permission to enter Egypt and what support was awaiting them on the other side. Originally from Jordan and the  , Zahra and Abedella Sckak had moved to the United States to start their family. The children were born in Texas before they relocated to California. In 2008, everyone moved back to Gaza, Abedella’s home, to be near extended family. Fadi Sckak returned to the United States at age 15 and his brother Ragi came back after high school. As a student working retail jobs and sending most of his earnings to his parents, Fadi Sckak said he never had the means to begin the costly U.S. immigration process for them. Fadi Sckak said that his parents struggled to find work in Gaza, where even before the war employment was scarce. Instead, he said, they relied “solely on the money I sent them as their primary source of income.” While living in the United States years ago, he added, his father worked several jobs. He drove an ice cream truck for a time, cooked at Pizza Hut and KFC, and worked as a handyman to provide for the family. His mother, he said, had memorably “made a scene” another time, when he attempted to obtain the paperwork needed to travel back to the United States as a teenager amid another period of war, in 2014. She held his U.S. passport high as she pushed her way through a clamoring crowd of Palestinian travelers trying to cross the border. “My mother definitely has a lot of courage, and that’s what kind of made me who I am today,” he said. “She’ll do anything for me, so it’s like, why wouldn’t I do the same?” Ragi Sckak was given permission to return home to Colorado two months early from his training rotation in Korea. He is beginning paperwork that will allow Zahra to become his military dependent, granting her benefits and helping facilitate efforts to secure her U.S. citizenship. He said he’s looking forward to reuniting with his mother, but feels constant pain and regret that he hadn’t known how to get the attention of military and government leaders soon enough to rescue his father. Zahra Sckak said she looks forward to creating a new life with her sons in the United States. “That’s what I wish for,” she added. “This is my dream come true.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBBBLCB6FX7VNRHR3VD6VEQHWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBBBLCB6FX7VNRHR3VD6VEQHWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBBBLCB6FX7VNRHR3VD6VEQHWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBBBLCB6FX7VNRHR3VD6VEQHWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBBBLCB6FX7VNRHR3VD6VEQHWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HBBBLCB6FX7VNRHR3VD6VEQHWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/08/soldiers-mother-rescued-gaza/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 05:00:00,

CHICAGO — Back at home after a disastrous trip, the depleted Chicago Blackhawks desperately needed an encouraging performance. With Colin Blackwell leading the way, they got one. Blackwell had two goals and an assist, and Chicago beat the Calgary Flames 4-3 on Sunday in the Blackhawks’ first game since Connor Bedard was sidelined by a broken jaw. “I think you can create a storyline for each game and each part of the season,” Chicago defenseman Connor Murphy said, “and for us, I think that’s a great way to go at it now, is realizing we have a lot of guys out and for everyone to come and band together quick and win games by work ethic, really.” Nikita Zaitsev added a goal and an assist for last-place Chicago, which had dropped five in a row and seven of eight overall. Philipp Kurashev also scored, and Petr Mrazek made 28 saves. Bedard’s jaw was fractured when the No. 1 overall pick in last year’s draft was hit by New Jersey defenseman Brendan Smith during Friday night’s   to the Devils. Chicago then lost Nick Foligno when he broke a finger on his left hand in a fight with Smith. Nazem Kadri had two goals for Calgary, which closed out a 2-2-0 road trip after losing 3-2 at Philadelphia on Saturday. Andrew Mangiapane also scored, and Jonathan Huberdeau had two assists. “Not good enough,” Flames forward Mikael Backlund said. “If we want to be a playoff team, that’s a game we’ve got to win, find a way to win. Yeah, it wasn’t good enough.” Blackwell scored the first goal of the game with a well-placed wrist shot 4:32 into the first period. He made it 4-2 with a power-play goal with 5:23 left, beating Dan Vladar on the goaltender’s glove side. “A lot of guys stepped up today and I thought we had a great team effort,” Blackwell said. “When you do the little things like that and we get good special teams, we come out with a victory.” Calgary got one back on Kadri’s 13th of the season with 4:41 remaining, but Chicago held on in the final minutes. “Today not the best,” Kadri said. “Obviously walking out of here, .500 road trip, which is OK, but we felt like it could have been better.” Each team had to deal with an unfortunate deflection in the second period. Calgary took a 2-1 lead at 3:26 when Mangiapane’s power-play shot from the side banked in off Murphy’s right skate. Mangiapane was credited with his eighth goal of the season. After Kurashev tied it with his eighth, Zaitsev’s big slap shot from beyond the right circle went in off the right skate of Flames defenseman Nick DeSimone for a 3-2 lead with 5:11 left in the period. It was Zaitsev’s second goal. With nine players on injured reserve,  , the Blackhawks went with seven defensemen against the Flames. There has been no word on how long Bedard and Foligno will be out. The 18-year-old Bedard was off to an impressive start in his first season, leading the Blackhawks with 15 goals and 18 assists. “Still just evaluating how he’s doing and settling down,” coach Luke Richardson said. “We know there’s a jaw fracture, but it’s swollen so I think the doctors are just giving it a few days to see how it settles.” Richardson inserted Zach Sanford into the lineup after the veteran forward was claimed off waivers from Arizona on Saturday, but Rem Pitlick had some travel issues after he was acquired in a trade with Pittsburgh.

MORAY, Peru — Chef Virgilio Martínez chews a raw   as he listens to a Quechua-speaking subsistence farmer describe an Andean technique for hedging against inclement weather. Broad beans and pukutu, a rare, multicolored, ancient variety of corn, are planted together, Cleto Cusipaucar explains. If there are heavy rains, the maize will fail but the pulses will thrive. If conditions are drier, the beans won’t grow, but the corn will. “I wish I had more time to spend just listening,” says Martínez, 46, who was honored this year as creator of the world’s best restaurant. “Every time I do, I learn something new.” The men are standing in a field overlooking Moray, an enormous pre-Columbian basin of concentric tiers dug into a mountainside above Peru’s Sacred Valley of the Incas. Thought to have been used as an agricultural laboratory, Moray is home to a surprising effect: As you descend into the bowl, the temperature rises. Modern researchers believe the Inca used the terraced rings to acclimatize crops to different altitudes for their highly vertical empire. Moray is where Martínez has built a center for his  , a contemporary culinary research institution anchored in the study of local traditions and ecological knowledge, which has helped propel the chef to rock star status in the gastronomic world. In June,  , was named   among the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, arguably the most influential such list in the industry. It had ranked in the Top 10 for years. The honor, voted on by more than 1,000 international experts, cemented Peru’s place on the culinary map. Central, with an innovative tasting menu that showcases Peru’s breathtaking geography and biodiversity, led a cohort of four Lima restaurants in the 50 Best — more than from any other city in the world. How the gastronomic scene in the capital of troubled, underdeveloped Peru came to triumph over established powerhouses such as Paris and New York owes much to the personal talent and drive of Martínez and Lima’s other high-end chefs. But it’s no coincidence that they are Peruvian, their creativity forged in this South American nation’s highly original and varied national food culture, one that is finally being recognized as one of the world’s greatest. Wherever you go here, Peruvians of all races and classes love not only to eat but also to talk about food, with myriad appetizing options for all budgets. Most of the recipes can be found only in Peru; they’re invariably made with fresh ingredients. “Food is the best thing about Peru. We have so many dishes and ingredients,” says fruit seller Pamela Clemente, 32, as she tucks into a ceviche, Peru’s national dish, in a street market in Lima’s gritty La Victoria district. “I don’t know what Peru would be like without our cooking,” she says. “We’d have no country left.” In a society whose self-esteem has been battered by runaway corruption, political dysfunction, the world’s highest covid-19 mortality and the  , anthropologist Alexander Huerta Mercado says, cuisine is the one enduring source of collective pride — and sheer joy. “Most Peruvians have never visited Machu Picchu,” says Huerta Mercado, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. “But food is different. Any foreigner in Peru will straight away be asked if they like the food. You’re not supposed to answer no. Chefs are cultural heroes here. Everyone wants to be one.” Martínez’s center, inaugurated just before the pandemic, draws together chefs, botanists, anthropologists, artists and others to investigate new and sustainable ways to harness and use the flavorful, nutritious ingredients from the Andes, the Amazon and the Pacific Coast. Cusipaucar, the farmer, and other locals work three acres of land next to Moray, harvesting   produce such as tubers   and  , and herbs such as huacatay, a local marigold used heavily in Peruvian cooking. The villagers keep half the produce; the rest goes to Mil, Martínez’s small restaurant here, and Central. Cusipaucar, 58, cultivates 50 varieties of potato, but can market only four, for want of commercial demand. He tells Martínez that he has counted 80 Andean plants, traditionally consumed for food and medicine, that are falling out of use among neighboring communities. “It’s my biggest worry,” he says. “We’re going to lose them forever.” Martínez nods and promises to include the threatened varieties in Mater’s botanical garden. “Tell me which plants, which seeds,” he says. “We’re completely aligned. We can help you.” Martínez’s relationships with artisanal suppliers such as Cusipaucar, fishermen in the Pacific and Indigenous communities in the Amazon, has shaped Central’s tasting menu, Mundo en Desnivel — loosely, World on an Incline. Heavily plant-based, it takes diners on a brisk voyage across Peru, noting for each of the 14 courses the altitude at which the ingredients were harvested — in many cases, foraged in the wild. Throughout, Martínez delights in throwing curveballs at diners with unexpected textures and tastes that belie the food’s appearance. Highlights include a dish called Warm Sea, from 15 meters below sea level on Peru’s northern coast, a breezy broth of grouper with crispy clams and ají limo, a fiery Peruvian pepper; Extreme Altitude, from 4,200 meters above sea level in the altiplano, with five varieties of corn, crunchy Andean amaranth seeds and delicate sweet potato leaves; and Amazonian Waters, from 190 meters above sea level, with cured pacu, a herbivorous cousin of the flesh-eating river piranha, watermelon slices and a foam of coconut and coca (yes, the basis for cocaine). In the sleek, dark salon in the bohemian Lima district of Barranco, diners can view a dozen or so chefs in black T-shirts and aprons, some from as far afield as France and Spain, through a long window into a minimalist, stainless steel kitchen. The atmosphere of congenial efficiency is a far cry from the bullying made infamous in restaurant documentaries. Martinez says he experienced such a kitchen in London. There, he worked “with fear,” an emotion he says is antithetical to the “meaning” he now tries to construct. Martínez’s creations break with Peruvian traditions. They are light, even airy, and their flavors are kept subtle to avoid one course from overpowering another. Conventional Peruvian cooking is all about bold, intense flavors, including from native chile peppers. Many of the country’s most celebrated dishes — ají de gallina, a korma-like chicken recipe; arroz con mariscos, a paella-influenced seafood rice dish; and an extensive pantheon of deserts, a legacy of French influence — might best be described as comfort food. Peru’s culinary excellence is partly the result of its expansive natural pantry. Its tropical latitude, with huge variations in altitude from the Andean peaks to the Pacific Coast, hosts almost every kind of ecosystem, and therefore crop and livestock, on Earth. Famously, that includes  , but also all kinds of herbs, cereals, pulses and produce new to most foreigners. What’s more, Peru’s Pacific waters are  , thanks to the plankton-rich Humboldt current. Peruvian food — or “combat,” in the local slang — fuses a range of influences, from distinct Indigenous traditions on the coast, in the mountains and the rainforest to waves of immigration, voluntary and involuntary, from Spain, Africa, Italy, China and Japan, among others. That blend of geography and history explains the primordial soup that gave birth to Peruvian cuisine. But no one has pinpointed the proverbial lightning strike that sparked it into life. Huerta Mercado has a theory. Peru’s culinary genius is the result of the “precariousness” of life in a chaotic society with patchy rule of law, he says. “There’s no tomorrow, no concept of the future,” he says. “Peruvians live in a perpetual present, and we need immediate gratification and sensory overload.” Some of those influences can be seen in  . Thought to have pre-Colombian roots, it was once cured with juice from acidic local fruits, including tumbo, known in English as banana passion fruit. Today tumbo has been replaced by lime, introduced by the Spanish conquerors. The large cuts of fish, served with outsize kernels of corn and steamed sweet potato, are a later addition, borrowed from sashimi brought by Japanese in the early 20th century. Peru’s next most celebrated national dish,  , is made up of strips of sirloin stir-fried in a wok with sliced tomatoes and red onions and flavored with soy sauce, cumin and aji amarillo, a mild, uniquely Peruvian yellow chile pepper. The classic plating includes rice and fat fries made from floury, absorbent Peruvian yellow potatoes. But there is also a version with  , a hearty Afro-Peruvian mixture of rice and pulses seasoned with pork fat. Traditionally, many of these recipes were served exclusively at home. The template for the poshest restaurants was French cuisine; Lima’s largely White elite looked down on local recipes — even on seafood, a centerpiece of the contemporary Peruvian board. But in the last two decades, a generation of young chefs has returned from culinary schools in Europe, North America, Japan and beyond to train their new skills and techniques on Peru’s traditional home cooking, reclaiming and giving new life to working-class standards. Martínez, rejecting “French hegemony,” asks: “Why does the meal have to start with champagne? Where is that written?” Martínez and other chefs have been the strongest voices for conserving Peru’s increasingly threatened crop megadiversity, maintained by small farmers while agricultural exports based on intensive single-crop cultivation have boomed. Peru just renewed a 10-year  , a cornerstone of U.S. Big Ag that’s viewed as threatening to Peru’s traditional custodians of the country’s diverse ingredients, farmers who typically work only an acre or two. The move was championed by Martínez’s mentor,  . Acurio, often credited with kick-starting the culinary renaissance with the opening of his Lima restaurant Astrid y Gastón in 1994, was   until his protégé’s meteoric rise. His unusual ability to straddle the cultural gulf between the Lima elite and the rural underclass saw the 56-year-old briefly lead polls in the 2016 presidential race until he ruled himself out. (He had not indicated an interest in running.) Still, Peru’s gastronomic revival faces obstacles. Fast-food chains are growing their footprint here, and obesity rates, among the lowest in Latin America, are rising. “We’re importing the North American model of mass food,” Martínez warns. “It’s food that makes you sick.” After Central’s triumph in the world rankings this year, there was snark about the $384 cost of its tasting menu in a country where the Food and Agriculture Organization says half the population now experiences food insecurity. Martínez says he employs around 100 people directly while paying above-market rates to — and establishing stable, long-term relationships with — his often humble suppliers. Central has also raised Peru’s international profile and attracted tourists. Although he eschews political posturing, his vindication of Indigenous knowledge is a profoundly political act in a society where   in December and January 2023 was motivated, the Organization of American States concluded, by “major stigma” against Andeans. “I hope this restaurant is giving meaning to the responsibility of doing haute cuisine in a country full of incoherences, where hunger exists, things don’t work and there is a lack of civic awareness,” Martínez says. “It’s about what I can do from what I accept is a tiny bubble.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B24KBW5KDURIAQK664QI6Y7M_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B24KBW5KDURIAQK664QI6Y7M_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B24KBW5KDURIAQK664QI6Y7M_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B24KBW5KDURIAQK664QI6Y7M_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B24KBW5KDURIAQK664QI6Y7M_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B24KBW5KDURIAQK664QI6Y7M_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7B24KBW5KDURIAQK664QI6Y7M_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440&impolicy=high_res 1440w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/01/08/lima-peru-worlds-50-best-restaurants-central/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 11:00:00,

Immediately after Evin Thompson drained a three-pointer to reestablish Sherwood’s fourth-quarter lead, his left foot landed on a Blake defender. The junior guard went down — hard. The referee’s whistle sounded, although it was nearly drowned out amid the boisterous Colesville gym. Thompson, writhing in pain and clutching his left ankle, was in no condition to complete the four-point play. In came Carlton Hill, who missed the free throw but collected his own rebound — and found teammate Micah Webb for a three-pointer that capped a crucial six-point trip in what ultimately turned into an 86-76 Warriors win in a clash between Montgomery County heavyweights in Silver Spring. “I’m not going to lie. I was kind of nervous when I saw Evin on the ground,” said Webb, who scored a game-high 31 points. “... He trusted me, my team trusted me ... so I just had to play through it.” Sherwood (9-1) played through a lot. The host Bengals (8-3) led by 13 after the first quarter, but the visitors stayed composed, cutting the deficit to two by halftime. They trailed much of the second half but remained within striking distance thanks in large part to Webb, who scored 20 points in the second half. “A lot of my teammates were finding me, telling me to shoot it. So I was just like, ‘All right, if they want me to shoot it, I’m just going to keep on shooting it,’ ” Webb said. A perfect example came with two minutes remaining and Sherwood clinging to a lead. The senior drove into a pair of defenders and spun left — to his shooting hand — before making a fadeaway jumper. “They [were] trusting me, and I was trusting them,” Webb said. In the teams’ matchup a little more than a year ago, Webb missed a three-pointer at the buzzer that would have given Sherwood a one-point win. The defeat, and the guard’s role in it, took a toll on his confidence. He got a measure of redemption Friday but emphasized that the win was a small step in a larger journey. That journey includes another meeting with the Bengals in about a month. There’s reason to expect that contest to be heated — after the buzzer Friday, there was some pushing and shoving between the teams, and Webb noted “a lot of bad blood.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEATVX575NCE3H774APMAGOTUI.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEATVX575NCE3H774APMAGOTUI.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEATVX575NCE3H774APMAGOTUI.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEATVX575NCE3H774APMAGOTUI.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEATVX575NCE3H774APMAGOTUI.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CEATVX575NCE3H774APMAGOTUI.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/sherwood-blake-boys-basketball/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 21:56:00,

HOUSTON — It’s a blaring-loud team against a not-so-loud team, a team that pummels against a team that dazzles, a team that has snarled noisy grievance against a team that has oozed gentle delight, a head coach who took his current job with national commotion against a head coach who took his current job without anyone noticing, a team that gave the country a “Da Vinci Code” football peep show against a team whose biggest “scandal” entailed winning cliffhangers, an Eastern time zone team against a Pacific Northwest team (and all that entails), a team with a famous stadium against a team with a stadium that ought to be more famous, a program whose last national title wound up dubiously shared in 1997 against a team whose last national title wound up rationally shared in 1991. It’s a giant, fresh bale of contrasts, Michigan vs. Washington, the College Football Playoff national championship game coming Monday night, even if the separate streams merge at one place (besides Houston): It’s a team that went 14-0 against a team that went 14-0, and it’s a program from the Big Ten against  , even if nobody cares about that now and nobody much likes the prospect anyway. “Glorious is how I feel,” ninth-season Michigan coach and former Michigan quarterback Jim Harbaugh, 60, said after the  . “The most resilient guys I’ve ever been around,” second-season Washington coach and former one-season Washington consultant Kalen DeBoer, 49, said of his players after the  . Those two guys alone personify the variance. Harbaugh rode decades of fame into  , having quarterbacked Michigan and the Chicago Bears and the Indianapolis Colts and so on, having coached Stanford to   in 2010-11 and the San Francisco 49ers to  . Only the severest football intellectuals knew DeBoer, who had played wide receiver at Sioux Falls of the NAIA, had helmed Sioux Falls for five seasons (with three national titles), had coordinated offenses at Southern Illinois, Eastern Michigan, Fresno State and Indiana and had headed Fresno State for two years. He took the Washington job Nov. 28, 2021. On that Nov. 27, the starry Southern California program had  , wreaking a national tizzy and reiterating a reality: Washington faces not only the Eastern-Central bias of the country but the Southern bias of its own coast. “While DeBoer appears to be a solid choice and has the previous head coaching experience that was a requirement for the Huskies,” the Associated Press wrote inarguably, “he lacks some of the big name clout many Washington fans were hoping would come with the hire.” Not even the most extremist of internet extremists wrote any such thing about Harbaugh. DeBoer, meanwhile, exhibits the basic fallacy of  . Standing 25-2 at Washington with two bowl wins over Texas already, he joins the ultimate floodlights of the closing Monday as the latest getting-to-know-you figure in a sport long tilted eastward because of the country’s time zones, the citizens’ time constraints and the nation’s provincialism. The old bias showed up in the first 27 Heisman Trophy winners, all from the Eastern or Central time zone; in egregious national-title arguments such as 1978-79 or 2000-01; or, to some,   over Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Michigan’s national semifinal win drew 27.76 million viewers, owing some to the bowl (Rose) and opponent (Alabama), while Washington’s drew 18.77 million even given the opponent (Texas). Michigan’s   on Nov. 25 drew a staggering 19.07 million; Washington’s biggest regular season haul of eyeballs would be the 7.04 million pairs  . On the weekend of Dec. 1-2, 9.25 million watched   between Washington and Oregon and 10.02 million watched the   between Michigan and Iowa, proving again that Americans don’t like sports as much as certain people playing sports. This Michigan season thundered even more than usual especially after Oct. 19, when   that the NCAA had trained its harrumphing microscope upon Michigan and especially   who conducted an elaborate system of sign-stealing in the stadiums of future opponents. In its turbulent wake came the  , the   and the ritual swell of noise, condemnation, rationalization, questions of legitimacy and answers about legitimacy. “We know who we are,” Michigan lineman Trevor Keegan said  , where Michigan ran the ball for all 30 of its second-half plays, epitomizing its bloody approach that contrasts with the No. 1 passing team in the country, which would be Penix’s Washington. Keegan said that as Michigan grew defiant about the Big Ten’s   —   of the season — and as Michigan-Penn State drew 9.16 million viewers before Washington’s escapade with Utah drew 5.17 million later on. Keegan et al. knew who they were as they outscored opponents 36-10 on average, finished No. 1 in total defense, didn’t so much run the ball with bulwark Blake Corum as rammed it with gorgeous bluntness and faced only two real hair-raising episodes: late against Ohio State and later against Alabama. They would wind up against a Washington team that beat an excellent Arizona, 31-24; beat an even more excellent Oregon, both 36-33 and 34-31; beat Arizona State and a post-Oregon letdown, 15-7, from a late 7-6 deficit with an 89-yard interception return; beat USC, 52-42, from a lovely 42-42 after three quarters; beat very good Utah, 35-28, and very good Oregon State, 22-20; beat Washington State, 24-21, when DeBoer went for it on fourth and one at 21-21 with 71 seconds left  ; and beat Texas, 37-31, after one of the scarier closing minutes you’ll ever see. Even through all of that fine entertainment, its offensive line proved rugged enough for the Joe Moore Award (which went the previous two years to Michigan), and Washington’s overall know-how made its use of luck seem limited. After Mishael Powell’s aforesaid 89-yard interception return, he said, “I could just tell by the demeanor of number seven [the wide receiver], that he was just, like, he looked a little bit more determined,” like “he might be getting the ball.” He never did, just one turn in a grand, giddy sequence of them that took the purple all the way to here against the blue, those colors seldom more divergent.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSY5TYIVQKOYMESCLUTZIIDADM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSY5TYIVQKOYMESCLUTZIIDADM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSY5TYIVQKOYMESCLUTZIIDADM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSY5TYIVQKOYMESCLUTZIIDADM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSY5TYIVQKOYMESCLUTZIIDADM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CSY5TYIVQKOYMESCLUTZIIDADM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/michigan-washington-college-football-playoff/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 05:30:00,

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee will invest millions of dollars in an initiative that aims to engage with and persuade voters of color to support Democratic candidates as part of its effort to take back the House majority in November. The initial $35 million push, which the committee announced Tuesday, will target key congressional districts with large minority populations and comes amid growing concerns about minority voters in 2024. The DCCC’s initiative — P.O.W.E.R. (“Persuade. Organize. Welcome. Educate. Reach.”) the People — surpasses the committee’s $30 million investment during the 2022 election cycle. The initiative will focus on research and polling, paid media, organizing, voter protection and education, as well as countering disinformation. “Democrats are committed to bringing responsible governance back to the House so that we can continue the important work of lowering costs, protecting and expanding health care, and delivering for our constituents,” Rep. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), the DCCC chair, said in a statement. “We know that voters of color are critical to Democrats’ coalition and the DCCC’s investments highlight our commitment to continuously engaging with communities of color on issues they care about.” Despite President Biden’s  , Democrats fared  , staving off a predicted “red wave,” and had   in 2023. But so far, key minority demographics historically aligned with Democrats’ voting coalition are showing less enthusiasm for supporting the party in 2024 — with recent surveys suggesting minority voters have been less interested in the upcoming races than their White counterparts. in December found White registered voters were 13 percentage points more likely than Black voters to be “extremely interested” in the 2024 presidential election, 59 percent vs. 46 percent. Among Hispanic voters, 55 percent were extremely interested. Tim Persico, a former executive director of the DCCC, said one of the major lessons after recent election cycles was that the party needed to engage early with prospective minority voters. “What we learned from our predecessors was (that) we have to start this commitment to communities of color early. It needs to be an investment, not just in TV and not just in digital or mail, but all of the above, plus on-the-ground organizing,” said Persico, who is now a principal at GPS Impact, a communications consulting firm. The committee said in a news release on Tuesday they plan to use polling and research to tailor their messaging in different congressional districts to be “culturally competent,” also delivering the messaging in several languages. It also said it is undertaking the DCCC’s first “media consumption research project to ensure that we are smartly reaching people where and when they consume information.” The DCCC also will make efforts to educate voters of color about changes to voting laws and informing them about ballot options. As part of its efforts to counter disinformation, the committee is launching an information hub that “will provide engaging content and resources that can be easily shared with friends, family, and community members to push back against false narratives and tout key accomplishments from House Democrats.” The DCCC has identified at least seven key districts to focus on with its initiative: The 22nd and 45th districts in California, Florida’s 27th, New Mexico’s 2nd, the 15th and 34th in Texas, and North Carolina’s 1st. The committee intends to defend Democratic incumbents in some of those districts, while the DCCC hopes to flip others that are represented by Republicans. Five of the districts are majority Latino. Chuck Rocha, the founder of Solidarity Strategies, said that in the coming election, “minority voters, especially Latinos, will be the deciding factor, more so than they ever have in the history of our nation, in who controls Congress and the Senate.” Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said that while polls suggesting a lack of engagement among voters of color this election cycle are concerning to Democrats, “the closer we get to the election, the more these opinion polls are going to change, the more it becomes clear to people that, look, this is not a referendum. This is a choice.” Albright, however, remains concerned about whether the   could push away minority voters — particularly Black voters — in November.

SEATTLE — Thirty-two summers ago, Napoleon Kaufman stepped onto the practice field at the University of Washington and received the scariest greeting. He was a true freshman running back fighting for a role on the greatest team in program history, and for one unforgettable play, he reckoned he was in the wrong place. Steve Emtman, the all-American defensive tackle who became the No. 1 pick of the 1992 NFL draft, burst into the backfield to disrupt a run. Kaufman braced for the thunderous impact. But Emtman did something more intimidating. He didn’t hit him. He just screamed as he ran past the new kid. The unknown — the threat — was far more haunting. “Real loud,” Kaufman said of the scream, laughing. “It was like: ‘This is crazy. Okay, this ain’t high school.’ ” Despite the intimidating welcome, it was the time of his football life. In 1991, the Huskies went 12-0, trounced Michigan in the Rose Bowl and won a share of the national title. The late Don James, their Hall of Fame coach and the program’s immortal “Dawgfather,” completed his masterpiece. Kaufman made a tidy contribution as a kick returner and third-string back, and four years later, he exited as Washington’s  , a record that stood for 17 years. But like the Emtman hit that never came, a poignant unknown disturbed that glorious era of Washington football. The Huskies will always have 1991, but they could’ve had so much more. They lost it — or in their hearts, it was taken from them — not on the field but because of a scandal that began with quarterback Billy Joe Hobert receiving $50,000 in loans and led to an investigation and Pac-10 sanctions that, in retrospect, look excessive. Now that we’re in the name, image and likeness era of college sports, any past overpolicing of wickedly exploited athletes seems ludicrous. Washington paid an exorbitant price for this structural hypocrisy. The torment hasn’t really stopped until now, more than three decades later. On Monday night, the Huskies finally will play again for the national title. Michigan stands in their way, the same program Washington ran through during the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 1992, to share that championship with Miami. The symmetry is more than a coincidence to loyal observers. It feels like a message, confirmation that the program is still what they’ve longed for it to be. The Huskies have spent most of the past 32 years hugging nostalgia, enduring a wild ride of false hope and hardships and refusing to settle for less than the standard James set. At last, they’re back. “If you had told me in 1991 that it would take this long, I wouldn’t have believed it,” Kaufman said. “What we did my freshman year, when you’re that young, looking back, we took it for granted. The program was in the Rose Bowl three straight years at the start of the ’90s. It’s amazing how long it has been to get back to this level. “Am I surprised? I think the word I would use is frustrated. People have been frustrated.” You must remember how great James and the Huskies were at the time of the scandal. They had ascended to perennial top-five status. Even in the old scattershot bowl system that sometimes resulted in co-champions and left schools hypothesizing about the superior team, they seemed a threat to win more titles. In 1984, with their Purple Reign defense, they went 11-1 and finished an agonizing second to BYU in the final polls. Later, after failing to make a bowl appearance in 1988, James adjusted and refreshed his program, leading to its longest stretch of dominance. Across parts of three seasons from 1990 to 1992, Washington won 22 straight games. If Coach Kalen DeBoer can put together one more winning game plan, it will be his team’s 22nd straight victory over a two-season stretch. During James’s hot streak, the Huskies were 30-2 at one point. If not for a November loss to UCLA, they would have been in good position to win the 1990 title. They closed that season with two emphatic victories, went undefeated the next season and entered a November 1992 game against No. 12 Arizona with an 8-0 record and the No. 1 ranking. Then came scandal and catastrophe. The Huskies lost three of their final four games, including a Rose Bowl defeat to Michigan. James retired before the 1993 season, angry over sanctions that included a two-year bowl ban. For most of the past 30 years, Washington has been left to debate its place in a transient game, one of several marquee programs of the 1980s and 1990s whose present yo-yos between the joy of the past and outside pessimism about the future. Except for six straight losing seasons from 2004 to 2009, Washington has fielded good teams taunted by fleeting glimpses of greatness. Rick Neuheisel guided the 2000 team to an 11-1 record and a Rose Bowl triumph, but the Huskies didn’t win another New Year’s Six bowl until last week when  . The promise of Neuheisel quickly disintegrated and ended with a bizarre gambling probe for participating in a neighborhood NCAA tournament pool. The school  , Neuheisel sued, and the sides reached  . After two seasons with former James lieutenant Keith Gilbertson, Washington turned to Tyrone Willingham, who bottomed out with an 0-12 season in 2008. Since then, the Huskies have enjoyed a gradual climb despite coaching turnover, rebuilding under Steve Sarkisian and returning to consistent 10-win status under Chris Petersen. Jimmy Lake, a defensive guru who was promoted after Petersen retired, flamed out within two seasons, paving the way for DeBoer. DeBoer inherited a 4-8 team. He has gone 25-2,   and making it seem as if the rough patch after Petersen didn’t happen. With Petersen’s last recruiting class as the foundation, DeBoer has supplemented the talent with good strategy, a dynamic offense and smart recruiting, mostly through the transfer portal, where he reunited with Maxwell Award-winning quarterback Michael Penix Jr. The Huskies haven’t taken a long path back to 1991. They’re living in the now, at last. They have renovated the kingdom that James and coaches before him built, connecting every era of Washington football. They have re-energized a program that owned the city long before Seattle was home to professional sports franchises. “There was a history and legacy of success that people expected of that team, and it reached a peak in 1991,” said Mike Gastineau, a retired Seattle sports radio host who wrote the book “ ” about the 1991 Huskies. “They were it. They were the hot ticket in this town. “[Ken Griffey Jr.] was starting to happen, but the Mariners didn’t have much of a baseball profile. The Seahawks were going through a rough patch. The Sonics were fallow as well. It would be another year or so before Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp fascinated everyone. The Huskies were what Seattle had and all they had before everybody else got going.” Kaufman is 50 now. In 2000, he left the NFL at 27 and turned to faith. He’s the pastor at the Well Christian Community Church in Livermore, Calif. He has lived several lives, wondering all the while when his school might experience those 1991 vibes again. He doesn’t have to be haunted by that unknown anymore. The rest of his teammates he so admired as a freshman — a star-studded list that included Mario Bailey, Ed Cunningham, Lincoln Kennedy, Dave Hoffmann and, of course, Emtman — can exhale a bit, too. The Huskies still have another game to win, a showdown between 14-0 teams. But the program feels settled again. If Washington can retain DeBoer, it figures to remain that way. “I just can’t describe how excited I am,” Kaufman said, words that numerous former Huskies have echoed this week. “It’s the way the program looks and feels. It’s just a classy operation. We all feel so connected.” If they were once stuck in time, they’re timeless now. Washington football belongs again. For this welcome party, there are many generations ready to scream like Emtman.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5EHN65HJLBJFOMBNSYQ7QRBY.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5EHN65HJLBJFOMBNSYQ7QRBY.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5EHN65HJLBJFOMBNSYQ7QRBY.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5EHN65HJLBJFOMBNSYQ7QRBY.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5EHN65HJLBJFOMBNSYQ7QRBY.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5EHN65HJLBJFOMBNSYQ7QRBY.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/university-washington-football-national-title/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 11:45:00,
"TEMPE, Ariz. — The Winnipeg Jets have one of the NHL’s best defensive teams, superb goaltending and multiple scoring threats. No wonder they have more points than any team in the league.

TEMPE, Ariz. — The Winnipeg Jets have one of the NHL’s best defensive teams, superb goaltending and multiple scoring threats. No wonder they have more points than any team in the league. Mark Scheifele scored two goals, Connor Hellebuyck stopped 15 shots and the Jets extended their points streak to 12 games with a 6-2 win over the Arizona Coyotes on Sunday night. “They’re a really good team,” Coyotes coach André Tourigny said. “They’re not just a good team, they play maybe the best hockey in the NHL. They’re really stingy and poised with the puck.” One of the NHL’s best defensive teams, Winnipeg shut down the Coyotes most of the night, holding them to four shots until Nick Schmaltz scored midway through the second period. Hellebuyck was sharp after being named to his fourth-career All-Star game on Thursday and the Jets finished with a 36-17 advantage in shots. Winnipeg has allowed three goals or fewer in a franchise-record 29 straight games and leads the NHL with 56 points. Vladislav Namestnikov, Cole Perfetti, Adam Lowry and Nikolaj Ehlers also scored in Winnipeg’s sixth straight win. The Jets’ points streak (10-0-2) is their longest since joining the NHL as the Atlanta Thrashers in 1999-00. “A lot a lot of good efforts each and every night, and when when some guys don’t have it, other guys pick them up,” Scheifele said. “It’s been it’s been a special ride so far.” Arizona’s Dylan Guenther scored in the third period of his 2023-24 debut and Karel Vejmelka stopped 29 shots. The Coyotes have lost three straight since winning six of seven. “They make it really tough, but I did not like the way we stayed with when when we had some adversity,” Tourigny said. “I think it’s out of character for us.” The Jets spent long stints in Arizona’s end in the first period, including a pair of power plays, but couldn’t get anything past Vejmelka in 11 shots. Namestnikov broke through late in the period, beating Vejmelka to the stick side after a giveaway behind the goal by Arizona’s Sean Durzi went right out in front. Ehlers made it 2-0 early in the second period, beating Vejmelka from the high slot after the puck caromed off teammate Dylan Samberg’s skate. Schmaltz capitalized on one of Arizona’s few good scoring chances in the second period, scoring from the low left circle on a feed from Clayton Keller. Perfetti put the Jets back up two goals late in the second period by punching in a rebound off his own shot on a delayed penalty. Arizona turned up the offensive pressure to start the third period, but it turned against them when Scheifele scored on a breakaway to make it 4-1. Guenther scored on a wraparound after Hellebuyck ventured too far from his crease. Scheifele and Lowry scored late to close out Winnipeg’s third straight five-goal game against Arizona this season. “We emphasize the pressure over the ice,” Jets coach Rick Bowness said. “They get in the zone, we get on them as quick as we can. We just apply as much pressure as we can all over so they’re not carrying the puck in.” UP NEXT Jets: Kick off a four-game homestand against Columbus on Tuesday night.

"CAIRO — Israeli attacks around central Gaza’s last remaining hospital caused hundreds of displaced civilians to flee over the weekend and forced most medical workers to evacuate, leaving wounded people with no good options for seeking care as fighting intensifies in the area. Organizations including Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee and Medical Aid for Palestinians have pulled their staff from al-Aqsa Hospital in recent days, after the surrounding areas in the Deir al-Balah region came under   and sniper fire, and residents received  warnings from the Israel Defense Forces to evacuate. CAIRO — Israeli attacks around central Gaza’s last remaining hospital caused hundreds of displaced civilians to flee over the weekend and forced most medical workers to evacuate, leaving wounded people with no good options for seeking care as fighting intensifies in the area. Organizations including Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee and Medical Aid for Palestinians have pulled their staff from al-Aqsa Hospital in recent days, after the surrounding areas in the Deir al-Balah region came under   and sniper fire, and residents received  warnings from the Israel Defense Forces to evacuate. The heavy fire and pullout of major international medical organizations sparked panic among displaced civilians sheltering at the facility, prompting many of them to flee yet again in search of relative safety, eyewitnesses said. “Due to extreme fear, a large number of displaced people who were present in the hospital’s courtyards dismantled their tents yesterday evening and this morning, and headed toward the city of Rafah,” Ashraf Abu Amra, a freelance journalist stationed at the hospital, said in a voice message Monday. By evening, 35 bodies had arrived at the hospital, he said, “because it is the only one that covers the entire central regions.” The IDF began a gradual drawdown of troops in northern Gaza late last month, saying it had largely disabled   operations in that part of the enclave. But widespread attacks continue throughout central and southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of civilians have taken refuge. Israel is under growing international pressure to rein in its military campaign and facilitate the delivery of more aid to the besieged enclave. Speaking to British and French counterparts at the start of Italy’s presidency of the Group of Seven wealthiest nations, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said it was “an absolute necessity to curb the number of Palestinian civilian casualties immediately,” according to a  of the call. “A second objective is to put pressure on the Israeli government to end military operations,” he said, and push for the “difficult but inescapable” two-state solution. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the region to try to stave off a broader war, said Monday that the United States and Arab leaders agreed to coordinate plans for how Gaza will be governed after Israel’s military campaign ends. “We agreed to work together and to coordinate our efforts to help Gaza stabilize and recover, to chart a political path forward for the Palestinians and to work toward long-term peace, security and stability in the region,” Blinken told reporters after meeting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Blinken arrived in the ancient Saudi city of Al-Ula on Monday following meetings with leaders in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Greece and Turkey. In his visits, Blinken has tried to generate interest from the leaders in contributing to a plan for Gaza’s governance and reconstruction — something Arab leaders have been loath to discuss as the enormous civilian death toll continues to climb. “No one I talked to thinks any of this will be easy,” he said. “All recognize the hurdles and no one thinks that anything will happen overnight.” Washington considers the financial support from Saudi Arabia and other energy-rich Persian Gulf countries as critical to any long-term solution in Gaza. Arab countries, meanwhile, have made clear they have no interest in footing the bill for reconstruction without establishing a firm path to a sovereign Palestinian state. Blinken then boarded a plane to Israel, landing on Monday night in Tel Aviv, where he said he would present the ideas he heard from Arab countries, including the need for the creation of a Palestinian state — something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out. He also said he would press Israel “on the absolute imperative to do more to protect civilians, and to do more to make sure that humanitarian assistance is getting into the hands of those who need it.” Israel’s campaign has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and its forces have repeatedly targeted hospitals in the enclave, saying Hamas militants use them to store weapons, command operations and hide hostages. As of Jan. 3, before the exodus from al-Aqsa Hospital, only 13 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals were partially functional, according to the World Health Organization — nine in the south and four in the north. In a   Sunday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said only five doctors remained at al-Aqsa Hospital to treat the wounded, with no food, scant medical supplies and no assurance that they would be protected from an attack. The WHO “has received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital Al-Aqsa Hospital,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. A WHO team visited the hospital on Sunday, he added, and “saw sickening scenes of people of all ages being treated on blood-streaked floors and in chaotic corridors.” Bob Kitchen, vice president for emergencies and humanitarian action at the International Rescue Committee, told The Washington Post that the IRC and Medical Aid for Palestinians had decided to pull out their joint emergency medical team from al-Aqsa Hospital after fighting in the area “got hotter and hotter” and bullets pierced the doctors’ room and the intensive care unit last week. “We were able to make it through the end of that day, but it was evident … that the Israelis had placed the hospital in the red zone and were moving further south,” he said. The IDF press office said it was “checking” on reports that fighting and bombardment in the vicinity had forced civilians and medical workers to flee al-Aqsa Hospital. Also Monday, the Israeli military said it had “eliminated” Hassan Hakashah, a Hamas operative in Beit Jinn in southern Syria. In a statement, the IDF described Hakashah as a “central figure responsible for rockets fired by Hamas from Syrian territory toward Israel in recent weeks.” It did not provide any more details about the operation, including whether he was killed in a strike. It is rare for Israel to publicly acknowledge strikes or targeted killings in other countries. But on Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz also said Israel was responsible for the killing of a Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon. Earlier in the day, Hezbollah, Lebanon’s most powerful militant group, announced that one of its commanders — Wissam Hassan Tawil — had been killed. “We’ve prepared ourselves to be able to fight on all fronts,” Katz said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 14. “In regards to the hit in southern Lebanon, we took responsibility for the elimination of the Radwan force’s acting commander,” he said, referring to Hezbollah’s elite special forces unit. So far, 135 Hezbollah members have been killed since Oct. 7, according to a Post tally. Israeli bombardments have also killed at least 19 Hezbollah members in neighboring Syria, the militant group told The Post. In a pair of speeches last week, Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah warned Israel that waging a war on Lebanon would be “very, very, very costly.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOFRDNOMB64SFJBOZWVMCNF6UY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOFRDNOMB64SFJBOZWVMCNF6UY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOFRDNOMB64SFJBOZWVMCNF6UY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOFRDNOMB64SFJBOZWVMCNF6UY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOFRDNOMB64SFJBOZWVMCNF6UY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WOFRDNOMB64SFJBOZWVMCNF6UY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/08/israel-hamas-gaza-hospital-blinken/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 13:52:00,
"Rusty Bowers, a former speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives who played a pivotal role in resisting efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, drove into his neighborhood east of Phoenix the day after Christmas to a spine-chilling scene. His home, nestled off a dirt road in an unincorporated slice of the desert, was surrounded by sheriff’s deputies. An unknown caller had reported that there was a pipe bomb inside and that a woman had been murdered. Rusty Bowers, a former speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives who played a pivotal role in resisting efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, drove into his neighborhood east of Phoenix the day after Christmas to a spine-chilling scene. His home, nestled off a dirt road in an unincorporated slice of the desert, was surrounded by sheriff’s deputies. An unknown caller had reported that there was a pipe bomb inside and that a woman had been murdered. After searching the house and questioning Bowers’s wife and grandson, according to Bowers and authorities, sheriff’s deputies determined that neither claim was true. The incident of swatting, a prank call to emergency services designed to draw a law enforcement response, wasn’t just a terrifying moment for Bowers and his family. It was one of many violent threats and acts of intimidation that have defined the lives of various government officials since the 2020 election. And now they are casting a shadow over the 2024 campaign as Americans prepare to vote in a primary season that kicks off this month. Those on the receiving end span the range of America’s democratic system, including members of Congress, state officials, local leaders and judges. While some are prominent, others have relatively low-profile roles. The intensity has accelerated in recent weeks. Bomb threats last week caused evacuations at state capitol buildings across the country. Federal authorities arrested and charged a man with threatening to kill a congressman and his children, while other members of Congress dealt with swatting incidents. The Maine secretary of state and the Colorado Supreme Court, both of which recently deemed   ineligible to run for the presidency because he engaged in an insurrection, received a surge of threats after being castigated by Trump in speeches and social media posts. Police responded to an alleged swatting attempt Sunday night at the home of Tanya S. Chutkan, the federal judge overseeing Trump’s election subversion case in D.C., according to a person familiar with the matter and a Chutkan family member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the incident is being investigated. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Friday called the wave of threats against government workers and public servants a “deeply disturbing spike.” While some on the right have been affected, many targets share a common attribute: They have done or said something that has earned Trump’s ire. Experts say that acts of physical violence toward officials and politicians since the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob on  , 2021, remain relatively rare. But they caution that the possibility of harm being inflicted on public servants is already undermining the health of U.S. democracy because the intimidation risks influencing their decision-making. Officials who have been targeted say they fear that threats could, at any time, tip over into physical violence. I am really worried that there is going to be a tragedy,” Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky said in an interview. “I believe people when they say that they want to hurt us or kill us. I don’t think they’re idle threats.” Members of the Wisconsin Supreme Court were hit with a wave of threats — many of them misogynistic and antisemitic — after they ruled 4-3 in December 2020 to uphold Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. The court has continued to receive threats in the years since, including one on Thursday that came into the court clerk’s office. The court had been dominated for years by conservatives, but following an election last year, it has a liberal majority that has begun to rule on key political questions, including state legislative redistricting. Karofsky, who is part of that narrow majority, said she views the threats as an attempt to intimidate judges into changing their rulings. I think mostly radical people on the right … are trying to exert influence on the judiciary in an anti-democratic fashion,” she said. “It is through intimidation. It is through threats. It is through violence.” On Wednesday, bomb threats forced evacuations, closures or stepped-up security measures at more than a dozen state capitols, in  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  and  . The FBI said it had no information to indicate that the threats were credible. Additional security threats were reported Thursday in  ,  ,  ,   and Wisconsin, according to officials and local news outlets. The day before sheriff’s deputies surrounded Bowers’s home — an incident that has not been previously reported — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, was the target of a swatting attempt on Christmas Day. So was Rep. Brandon Williams, a Republican from New York, according to social media messages from both politicians and local news outlets. Federal authorities   on Wednesday and charged him with threatening to kill Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) and his children. “This is just a small snapshot of a larger trend that has included threats of violence against those who administer elections, ensure our safe travel, teach our children, report the news, represent their constituents and keep our communities safe,” Garland told reporters on Friday. “These threats of violence are unacceptable. They threaten our fabric of democracy.” He said Justice Department officials had been working to combat such threats for years and were meeting Friday “to determine how we can double down on those efforts in the new year.” Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard University who studies democracies around the world, said politicians and election workers who are threatened have their lives affected, often needing to adopt new security measures or other safeguards. There is also an impact on decision-making as officials attempt to safely carry out their jobs. Violent threats “make us a less democratic political system” because of how they change political incentives, Levitsky said. Politicians have, for instance,   that they have   their votes out of fear for their families’ safety. Levitsky noted that while violent threats span the political spectrum, the “vast majority” come from activists and others on the far right. Crucially, those threats are often not discouraged by their representatives in government, he said. Rather, Trump and others have appeared at times to  . For instance, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” over the weekend that she condemned violence, but she also echoed Trump’s characterization of those incarcerated for their role in the violent Jan. 6 insurrection as  The lack of widespread political violence since the Jan. 6 insurrection doesn’t make people feel safer, Levitsky added, because so much “fantasy violence” is playing out on social media. Such threats have “an acute effect of stopping people from doing their jobs,” said Lilliana Mason, associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. Longer term, people can be discouraged from running for office or engaging in election work, added Mason, who is the co-author of the book “Radical American Partisanship. “So it not only intimidates people who are in office, but it changes the makeup in the future of people who will be in office,” Mason said. Research from Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative, which   and threats directed at election officials in collaboration with  , has found that women and people of color, who are much more likely to be violently threatened in the first place, are also more likely to step away from the work that is exposing them to threats. Law enforcement officials often advise targets of threats and swatting attacks not to discuss in public the difficulties such attacks cause, according to several swatting targets, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe their experiences. The perpetrators of such threats often crave the validation that they have caused fear or disruption; knowing they have been successful only encourages them, these people said. But officials also said it was also important for the public to know when officials are being threatened for doing their jobs. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who in late December removed Trump from the state’s presidential primary ballot under the Constitution’s insurrection clause, was the target of a swatting call the day after she issued her decision. “I was prepared for anger and pushback and criticism,” Bellows, a Democrat, said in an interview. “But I was not prepared for aggressive and threatening communications not only targeting me, but members of my family. Nor was I prepared for the swatting incident.” An unknown man called emergency services and said he had broken into Bellows’s address, according to the Maine Department of Public Safety. Bellows and her husband were not home at the time, and law enforcement “responded perfectly and efficiently and they were very communicative,” said Bellows. The incident, she added, “seemed designed to send me a message to silence me or inspire fear, and that is unacceptable.” On Wednesday, Gabriel Sterling, chief operation and financial officer for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, received a call from the police chief in his hometown of Sandy Springs in suburban Atlanta, asking whether he was okay. The police chief had received a call about an active threat at Sterling’s home. Sterling arrived home to 14 police cars outside his house. “More than anything, it just pisses me off,” Sterling, a Republican, said in an interview. “The intent of these things, regardless of who is doing it, is to breed panic and concern and expend emotional and real resources for people.” Sterling was a key election official in Georgia during the 2020 presidential election. He spoke out forcefully against Trump’s attempts to cast doubt on the election results and the threats to election workers that followed the vote. “Someone’s going to get hurt,”   “Someone’s going to get shot. Someone’s going to get killed.” Sterling described that warning as prescient, given how much more common violent threats have become. In response to such intimidation, “you put on your big-boy pants and you keep doing your work,” he told The Post. “You don’t let people who are trying to undermine the institutions undermine institutions.” Like Sterling, Bowers has been repeatedly threatened and harassed since the 2020 election. He was out running errands when the call about the bogus report of a murdered woman and a pipe bomb at his home came in to law enforcement. His wife and adult grandson were inside when police showed up. “You just get kind of hardened by all this,” Bowers, who  , told The Washington Post. “I don’t know if someone’s trying to make our lives miserable or why, and there’s just an uncertainty.” Karofsky, the Wisconsin Supreme Court justice, said she thought it was important to let the public know what officials are dealing with. “We are at a moment of time where our democracy literally is on the line, and we have to figure out if we are just going to turn it over to a bunch of insurrectionists who think it is perfectly okay to use violence and intimidation to get the rulings that they want in a courtroom,” Karofsky said. “Or are we going to have a democracy where people follow the rule of law?

NEWARK, N.J. — The Vancouver Canucks caught the New Jersey Devils coming off a tough game and playing without three major players and they took full advantage. J.T. Miller and Elias Pettersson each scored twice and Quinn Hughes added three assists to lead the Canucks to a 6-4 victory over the pesky Devils on Saturday night in a game that New Jersey made interesting after twice falling behind by three-goal deficits. “It feels good to win a road game on a big road trip so I liked a lot of our game today. I think we all felt pretty good about most of it,” Miller said. “I just think that’s a classic case of sitting back a little too much with the lead and they have a ton of talent over there so they’re gonna make plays.” The game was supposed to be the second matchup of the three Hughes brothers in an NHL game but it never happened as Devils All-Star center Jack Hughes was   sustained on Friday night. New Jersey was also without Timo Meier and Ondrej Palat because of injuries. That left Luke Hughes of the Devils and Quinn Hughes to face off and the Canucks dominated with New Jersey coming off a very physical game at home on Friday night that saw No. 1 overall pick Connor Bedard of the Chicago Blackhawks  . Conor Garland made a back-breaking goal for the Canucks late in the second period after the Devils cut down a 3-0 deficit to a goal and Thatcher Demko made 21 saves in his 100th career NHL win. The Devils won the first meeting between all three Hughes brothers  . Colin Miller scored twice and Erik Haula and Brendan Smith once for New Jersey, which was outshot 42-25. Nico Daws made 36 saves for the Devils, who are now 1-7-1 in the second of back-to-back games. After a scoreless first period, the Canucks jumped to a 3-0 lead in the opening 4:37 of the middle period. Pettersson scored on a deflection at 41 second and J.T. Miller converted twice in a 64 second span. Haula cut the gap with 3-2 with 23 seconds left in the period but Garland tallied on a wraparound 12 seconds later. Pettersson seemed to put the game out of reach early in the third period, scoring in close for his 17th goal and a 5-2 lead. “It feels good,” Pettersson said. “Still I don’t like the way we kind of let them back in the game. It’s a win in the end but also we want to do better at the end.” Colin Miller and Smith scored in under a two-minute span to give the Canucks something to worry about with seven minutes to play. It also forced coach Rock Tocchet to take a time. New Jersey had a late power play and one outstanding chance but Dakota Joshua iced the game with an empty-net goal with 1:11 to go. “They had us on our heels. Their energy was incredible to start the game,” Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. “We didn’t win enough battles. I thought we hung in there — tough goal at the end of the period after we made it 3-2 — but pretty resilient group when you can get down to the third and force them in a timeout and we had a great look, the Nico (Hischier) to Haula power-play chance.” After the game, Ruff said defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler broke his foot early in the second period. New Jersey lost defenseman Dougie Hamilton to a pectoral injury on Dec. 1. They started the season as the Devils No. 1 defensive pair. UP NEXT Canucks: At the N.Y. Rangers on Monday.

Matt Boldy had two power-play goals, Marcus Johansson also scored, and Brock Faber had two assists. “I was just happy to win tonight,” Fleury said. “It hasn’t been working out. We’ve been missing a few guys. We obviously need points in the standings. “Catching Patrick is an honor, a guy I look up to growing up. In the moment I was happy to get the win here for the boys.” Cole Sillinger had three goals for his second career hat trick and Daniil Tarasov stopped 33 shots for Columbus, which has lost three of four — including two straight at home. “No. 1 for the team, you’ve got to find a way to win,” Wild coach John Hynes said. “It was obviously important for us and on top of it Flower went for tying the record, right? I’m very happy for him.” Sillinger   at 8:09 of the first period, tapping in Jake Bean’s tape-to-tape pass from the left circle.

Columbus regained the lead with  , 17 seconds into the second period, off a slick backhand drop pass from Kirill Marchenko. Boldy’s   at 10:15 of the second pulled the Wild even again, marking his second-career game with multiple goals with a man advantage. Faber’s secondary assist of the game marked his fourth multi-point game of the season and moved him into a tie for second among NHL rookies with 16. Columbus had taken just one shot in the third period until Sillinger tipped Boqvist’s wrister from the blue line with 5:45 left for his   and seventh of the season. Fleury was heading off for the extra skater but responded to a Columbus surge down the ice and   with less than two minutes left to block a likely Blue Jackets insurance goal. Johansson then slipped the puck past Tarasov with 1:32 remaining to tie the score again. “Open net, turnover, the first thing you know the puck is in the back of your net,” Blue Jackets coach Pascale Vincent said. “They played a good game. They really did. That’s a good team, heavy sticks. Their power play is lethal. It was a big point for us.” UP NEXT Wild: Host Dallas on Monday night.

"PITTSBURGH — Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen’s shaky December is behind him. The Buffalo goaltender stopped 40 shots and Zemgus Girgensons jammed a loose puck by Tristan Jarry late in the third period to lift the Sabres by the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-1 on Saturday night. “I think that was the most confident, poised I’ve seen him play in his whole career,” Buffalo forward Alex Tuch said of Luukkonen. “He’s got a shutout or two, but that was just so much confidence (tonight).” PITTSBURGH — Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen’s shaky December is behind him. The Buffalo goaltender stopped 40 shots and Zemgus Girgensons jammed a loose puck by Tristan Jarry late in the third period to lift the Sabres by the Pittsburgh Penguins 3-1 on Saturday night. “I think that was the most confident, poised I’ve seen him play in his whole career,” Buffalo forward Alex Tuch said of Luukkonen. “He’s got a shutout or two, but that was just so much confidence (tonight).” Tuch’s 10th goal of the season on a breakaway in the first period gave Buffalo an early lead. Rasmus Dahlin provided some insurance with a long flip into an empty Pittsburgh net just as Jarry headed to the bench for an extra skater as the Sabres won for just their second time in their last nine visits to PPG Paints Arena. “I’ve said it for weeks now, it’s a mentality,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “Talked about (us playing with) some mojo, some swagger. We didn’t have that and we played with fear. Tonight, you don’t come through that game unless you have that swagger and fearlessness.” Luukkonen won his second straight start following a stretch from Nov. 30-Dec. 23 in which he went 0-5-1 and allowed at least four goals four times. The 24-year-old from Finland also received a bit of help from his coaches when the Sabres successfully challenged a pair of Pittsburgh goals in the first period. Drew O’Conner’s tap-in from in front was waved off after a replay showed Sidney Crosby was offside as the Penguins entered the zone. Pittsburgh had a second goal taken away when officials ruled Penguins forward Jake Guentzel interfered with Luukkonen while redirecting a shot by Crosby. Guentzel did appear to brush against Luukkonen as the puck entered the crease. “A couple of goals against that ended up going back and (Luukkonen) didn’t get rattled at all,” Tuch said. “He went right back in there, made a couple big saves on breakaways. Never wavered.” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said Guentzel did make light contact with Luukkonen but didn’t think it affected the outcome of the play. “Based on that decision, our coaching staff needs to take a long look at the criteria of our understanding of what (interference) is,” Sullivan said. The Penguins did eventually tie it when Rickard Rakell scored near the end of a two-man advantage 7:49 into the third. Pittsburgh continued to press but Luukkonen held firm and the Sabres broke through with 4:38 remaining when Girgensons fought his way to the front of the Penguins’ net and flicked a backhand past Jarry. “Just got to keep pushing,” Guentzel said. “I thought we actually played pretty well and had a lot of the chances but just can’t give that one up in the third. It’s a tough one.” Jarry made 29 saves for the Penguins but appeared to be momentarily caught off guard when Connor Clifton threaded a pass from the Buffalo zone to Tuch standing all alone at the Pittsburgh blue line. Tuch took a few strides toward the goaltender then fired a wrist shot by Jarry 2:53 into the first. Jarry, pulled from a loss to Washington on Tuesday after a shaky start, quickly settled down but couldn’t get in front of Girgenson’s attempt from in close as Pittsburgh failed to build off a thrilling 6-5 win in Boston on Thursday. “We did a lot of things that we set out to accomplish,” Sullivan said. “We just didn’t win on the scoreboard.” Luukkonen made sure of it. He turned away a handful of breakaways, including a slick save on Guentzel late in the second period that was symbolic of the night. “They were good reads,” Luukkonen said. “It feels good to make those saves in those types of games and those types of situations. Sometimes that happens, there’s some defensive breakdowns. But it feels good to come up with the saves.” UP NEXT Sabres: Begin a six-game homestand on Tuesday night when Seattle visits.

Scott Wedgewood made 18 saves. Tied 2-2 after two periods, Forsberg slipped a backhander behind Wedgewood 2:42 into the third to put Nashville ahead, and came around the back of the net and curled a shot off Wedgewood’s right skate into the net at 7:30 for a two-goal lead. “That’s what Fil does,” Nyquist said. “Two big goals in the third when we needed them the most.” Robertson pulled Dallas within one just past the midpoint of the period. The Predators gained a measure of revenge after the Stars pulled out a 3-2 win at Nashville on Dec. 23 by becoming the first NHL team to score the tying and winning goals in the final 15 seconds. “It felt like there were a lot more than six seconds left at the end (following the final faceoff),” Forsberg said. “But we played great. I think defensively they didn’t have any chances there at the end. “We obviously learned from that. We’ve got to play all the way through.” Nashville lost its five previous games against Dallas. Lankinen, appearing in his 100th NHL game, gloved Mason Marchment’s penalty shot almost three minutes into the second period. Forsberg, headed to his second All-Star Game, has team highs of 21 goals and 45 points. It’s his eighth season of at least 20 goals. Wedgewood made his 10th consecutive start and 11th straight appearance since taking over early in Dallas’ Dec. 15 game for All-Star Jake Oettinger, who was sidelined with a lower-body injury. “He’s probably running out of a little bit of gas,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said of Wedgewood. “We’ve asked a lot of him.” The Predators built a 2-0 lead on Nyquist’s score at 11:26 of the first period and Evangelista’s goal at 7:22 of the second. A goal by Dallas’ Sam Steel almost six minutes into the second period was disallowed for being offside following a Predators challenge. Seguin scored at 9:28 of the second and Benn tied the score at 2-all with a deflection with 45.4 seconds left in the period —- 5 seconds into a power play.

RALEIGH, N.C. — Brayden Schenn scored in the fifth round of the shootout to give the St. Louis Blues a 2-1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday night. It was Schenn’s 16th game in row without a goal, but the captain found a way to make a big difference at the end. He didn’t have a particular strategy in the shootout. “It’s a dry spell in my career,” Schenn said. “I haven’t scored in a while. You don’t overthink it.” Carolina’s Sebastian Aho and St. Louis’ Jake Neighbours converted in the fourth round. Nathan Walker scored in regulation to help the Blues win their second straight. Jordan Binnington made 29 saves, limiting an opponent to one goal for the second game in a row. “It’s fun when you’re in a rhythm like that,” Binnington said. “It’s nice to be winning these games against good teams.” Teuvo Teravainen scored for Carolina, and Antti Raanta stopped 21 shots. The Hurricanes had a five-game winning streak end in the first game of a six-game homestand. “It just didn’t work out in the end,” said Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour, whose team is 10-3-4 at home. The Blues, have won five of their last seven games. They hadn’t been in a shootout since their first two games of the season. “We know how hard we’re working,” Schenn said. “Nothing comes for free. We have to gut games out and find ways to win the tough ones.” Raanta, who was in just his second NHL game since Dec. 15, had an overtime highlight by stopping Brandon Saad about midway through the extra session. Carolina held a 28-19 edge in shots entering overtime. “Both teams weren’t giving very much,” Brind’Amour said. “It was obvious what was going on.” Walker scored his first goal in just his second NHL game of the season. Teravainen ended a five-game pointless streak by converting off a faceoff for his 14th goal of the season. That gave Carolina at least one power-play goal in seven consecutive games. After firing 13 shots on goal in the second period, the Hurricanes didn’t register a shot in the third until more than 10 1/2 minutes elapsed.

Brendan Gallagher, Sean Monahan, Joel Armia scored to give Montreal a 3-0 lead early in the second period. In the shootout, Mika Zibanejad attempted a one-handed deke only for the sprawling Montembeault to reach back and swat the puck away with his paddle. “I try not to think too much when guys are coming down on me in the shootout,” Montembeault said. “But (Zibanejad) did the same move on me last year — and scored. I made a nice save this time and I’m really happy.” Vincent Trocheck and Artemi Panarin each had a goal and an assist, and Adam Fox tied it for New York midway through the third. Jonathan Quick made 27 saves. “(Montembeault) was big all the way through it,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. “He played a solid game ... probably over 30 scoring chances. He was good in regulation, good in overtime, and made a heck of a save in the shootout on Mika.” Gallagher opened the scoring midway through the first with his sixth goal of the season and first in 25 games Monahan broke a 10-game drought 1:09 into the second with a shot that bounced off Rangers defenseman Ryan Lindgren and into the back of the net. Armia beat Quick between the legs 1:30 later. New York finally got on the board at with 9:32 left in the second with Trocheck’ tip. Trocheck then pulled off a nifty set play by tipping the puck between Mitchell Stephens’ legs during an offensive zone draw and setting up Panarin for his 25th with 5:31 left in the second. Fox tied it at 9:30 of the third with a point shot through traffic. “Every night here is special, but there’s some nights that stand out a little bit more,” Gallagher said. “Saturday night when the Rangers are in town, it was a good hockey game, there were chances both ways, both teams were making plays, it was physical. And Monty really stepped up and made some massive saves.” UP NEXT Rangers:. Host Vancouver on Monday night.

"LAS VEGAS — Jack Eichel and Nic Roy each scored two goals and the Vegas Golden Knights beat the New York Islanders 5-2 on Saturday night. Pavel Dorofeyev also scored for the Golden Knights, who had lost six of their last seven while getting outscored 29-15. Logan Thompson made 28 saves. LAS VEGAS — Jack Eichel and Nic Roy each scored two goals and the Vegas Golden Knights beat the New York Islanders 5-2 on Saturday night. Pavel Dorofeyev also scored for the Golden Knights, who had lost six of their last seven while getting outscored 29-15. Logan Thompson made 28 saves. Eichel scored in the first and third periods, the latter with an assist to rookie Lukas Cormier in his NHL debut, while Roy got his in the second and third to bolster an offense that was starving for life. “Credit to the group, we’ve always been a good rush team, but we always want to continue to work on an offensive zone play and scoring goals out of a cycle,” Eichel said. “So it’s good to see a few goals ... there were some good things to like about our offensive zone game. I thought it was just a good response for the group.” Mathew Barzal and Matt Martin scored as the Islanders lost for the third time in four games (1-2-1). Ilya Sorokin stopped 24 shots. “I thought, for about 2 1/2, three minutes I thought it was maybe our most solid game of the trip,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “Disappointing ending to (the trip), although I thought we did a lot of good things tonight. We had a lot of scoring chances. We just couldn’t put it in. We just have to get ready for our next game.” New York closed its road trip losing three of four (1-2-1) and will have two days off before a two-game homestand beginning with Pacific Division-leading Vancouver on Tuesday. Eichel, who leads all Golden Knights with 16 career points against the Islanders, put Vegas ahead 1-0 when his one-time blast got past Sorokin 6:25 into the game. The lead was short-lived, as an official replay ruled Barzal’s shot traced the top of the net just inside the crossbar, tying the game at 1-all with 8:47 left in the first. Thompson, who was starting the fifth straight game for Vegas, looked incredibly sharp, more so than he’s been recently. As the Islanders outshot Vegas 16-9 in the first period, Thompson was a major reason the game remained tied 1-1, including his biggest save of the game when he stymied Kyle Palmieri on a breakaway in the second period. “That was a big moment in the game,” Eichel said. “We trade odd-man rushes there, they get a breakaway and LT makes a huge save. Timely saves are so important in this game and he made them tonight, it was awesome to see. He’s battled for us, he made some big saves, not only then, but in other parts of the game. Tons of credit to Logan, he stepped up for us tonight.” The Golden Knights took a 3-1 lead when they got goals from Dorofeyev and Roy 1:30 apart late in the second. First, it was Dorofeyev tapping in a pass from Chandler Stephenson with 2:49 left, and then it was Roy skating into the left circle and snapping home a wrist shot with 1:19 remaining. Starting the third period on a power play, Cormier grabbed a loose puck off a faceoff and swung the puck to Eichel, who lasered a wrist shot from the top of the right circle to give Vegas a 4-1 cushion 31 seconds in. Martin scored a little more than two minutes later for the Islanders, and Roy followed up for the Golden Knights at 4:20 to provide the final margin. UP NEXT Islanders: Host Vancouver on Tuesday night.

"PORTLAND, Maine — Greeted by just a few claps and some intermittent boos, the Gonzaga basketball team trotted onto the Cross Insurance Arena floor. Friday night was not about the Eagles; it was the homecoming for Cooper Flagg, the nation’s top prospect and the top name on any premature 2025 NBA mock draft. PORTLAND, Maine — Greeted by just a few claps and some intermittent boos, the Gonzaga basketball team trotted onto the Cross Insurance Arena floor. Friday night was not about the Eagles; it was the homecoming for Cooper Flagg, the nation’s top prospect and the top name on any premature 2025 NBA mock draft. A Duke commit, Flagg returned with his twin brother, Ace, to the arena where they won the Maine Class A state championship two seasons ago. They now play for Montverde (Fla.) Academy, the No. 1 team in the country, but their presence at the Maine Event was certain to draw interest — and a sold-out crowd of 6,122. Cooper Flagg lived up to the billing. The 6-foot-9 forward had 23 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and eight blocks in a 93-51 blowout. Gonzaga, hoping to play the spoiler, was down double digits before it scored a point but still came away with something from the experience. “This is why you come to a school like ours and theirs,” Gonzaga Coach Steve Turner said, “to be in this type of environment you’ll see at the next level.” Hundreds of fans arrived more than three hours before the game, then rushed to their seats when the gates opened for the night’s first game, which pitted the Flagg brother’s former school, Nokomis, against a local rival. Then during the featured matchup, the crowd erupted in applause on every Flagg touch and “oohed” and “aahed” on each dunk. The fans booed when officials whistled Flagg for a double dribble and jeered even louder when he was called for a foul while attempting to block a shot. “We don’t see home pretty much at all anymore,” Flagg said. “It means everything to come back, see everybody and really feel the support in real time.” When Flagg checked into the game late in the second quarter after a rest on the bench, a young fan yelled, “I love you, Cooper!” Reese McAvoy, 9, of Millinocket, wore a Team USA T-shirt with Flagg’s No. 32 that his mother made. McAvoy watches many Montverde games online and was wide-eyed seeing his hero’s highflying dunks in warmups. “It’s awesome because I’ve seen Cooper on video and he’s inspiring me,” McAvoy said. “Not a lot of people from Maine go on to play pro sports, so that means he’s really special.” Flagg grew up in Newport, a small town about two hours north of Portland. He attended Nokomis as a freshman, winning the state championship with Ace and their older brother, Hunter, then a senior. Cooper and Ace transferred to Montverde shortly after. Following his first season at the prep school, which is located in a suburb of Orlando, Flagg reclassified from the Class of 2025 to 2024, jumping from a rising junior to a senior. Weeks later, he committed to the program he once described as his “dream school,” choosing the Blue Devils over reigning national champion Connecticut. Ace Flagg, a 6-7 forward with a handful of Division I scholarship offers, remains in the Class of 2025. Cooper Flagg rose to national stardom during the summer of 2022 as a key contributor to Team USA’s gold medal at the FIBA Under-17 World Cup. Last summer, he and Ace willed their Maine United AAU team to the finals of the Peach Jam, the top grass-roots tournament in the country. At that tournament, video surfaced of LeBron James watching Flagg play and later speaking with him; naturally, it went viral in the corners of social media obsessed with hoops. Still, Flagg never lost his connection to home. “Both boys have a ton of pride in that they’re representing the state of Maine and constantly go back to their Maine roots,” said Matt MacKenzie, who has trained the twins for years. Turner, an assistant coach with FIBA, said he viewed the opportunity for Gonzaga to play in Maine as a “nothing to lose” opportunity against a “high school all-star team” that features five of the top 48 seniors in the country. Gonzaga, which moved to No. 1 in   this past week but has since dropped consecutive games — including a 65-57 setback at Bishop O’Connell on Tuesday — will return home to a rugged Washington Catholic Athletic Conference schedule. The Eagles have three top-100 players of their own in the 2025 class,  : point guard Nyk Lewis (No. 53), combo guard Derek Dixon (No. 74) and center Christian Gurdak (No. 91). But they were no match for Montverde in terms of star power. Off the opening tip, Flagg leaked out and threw down a dunk. Heavy cheers followed and filled the gym throughout the night. “It was just crazy,” Lewis said of the atmosphere.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AEFIKLUI5DQACUWIGQLEORHH4A_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AEFIKLUI5DQACUWIGQLEORHH4A_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AEFIKLUI5DQACUWIGQLEORHH4A_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AEFIKLUI5DQACUWIGQLEORHH4A_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AEFIKLUI5DQACUWIGQLEORHH4A_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AEFIKLUI5DQACUWIGQLEORHH4A_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/cooper-flagg-gonzaga/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 12:01:00,
"ANAHEIM, Calif. — Michael Rasmussen scored the go-ahead goal with 1:07 remaining and the Detroit Red Wings extended their winning streak to three games with a 3-2 victory Sunday over the Anaheim Ducks. Joe Veleno and Dylan Larkin also scored and Alex Lyon made 29 saves as the Red Wings completed a successful three-game California road trip. ANAHEIM, Calif. — Michael Rasmussen scored the go-ahead goal with 1:07 remaining and the Detroit Red Wings extended their winning streak to three games with a 3-2 victory Sunday over the Anaheim Ducks. Joe Veleno and Dylan Larkin also scored and Alex Lyon made 29 saves as the Red Wings completed a successful three-game California road trip. The three victories to start January match Detroit’s final 13 games of December. “I feel like we felt a little sorry for ourselves a little bit there before Christmas with the schedule and injuries,” Larkin said. “It’s just managing the ups and downs of a long season and we have the three big wins. ... We have a great feeling in here and guys are bought into what we want to do before the All-Star break.” Rasmussen’s game-winner, his ninth goal of the season, came when he redirected the puck off his left skate and into the Ducks’ goal off a pass from Moritz Seider. The play was reviewed with the goal allowed after no kicking motion was detected. “Just trying to build a wall there and get some sort of a piece on it,” Rasmussen said. “Obviously a great pass so I just tried to redirect it and get it in.” Trevor Zegras scored two goals for the Ducks and Lukas Dostal made 25 saves. Troy Terry had an assist for Anaheim after missing the previous three games with an upper-body injury. Anaheim went 1-6-1 on a season-long eight-game homestand. The Ducks looked set to finish the homestand on a high note when they scored 20 seconds into the game. Terry fired a shot into traffic and Zegras deflected the puck toward the ice and into the goal after it took an indirect bounce past Lyon. The Red Wings tied it at 11:10 of the first period while on the power play when Larkin scored from the slot off a pass from David Perron for his 14th of the season. Detroit grabbed a 2-1 lead at 2:20 of the second period when Veleno scored on a wrap-around that he put up against Dostal’s pad and just across the line at the right post. Veleno’s eighth of the season was confirmed on replay. Zegras tied it at 3:55 of the third period when he took a cross-ice pass from Cam Fowler near the edge of the right circle and ripped a shot into the top right corner of the goal for his fourth of the season. With the assist, Fowler tied Steve Rucchin for fifth most points in Ducks history (432). “I thought we did a pretty good job,” Zegras said. “We wanted to work it behind the net, get the cycles going and find guys in that slot area. I feel like we could’ve had a couple more for sure but their goalie played well. So, credit to him.” The Ducks survived a Red Wings power play with just under four minutes remaining before giving up the go-ahead goal with the teams at full strength. “It was a huge trip for us,” Larkin said. “We left Detroit feeling like we played a couple of good hockey games and the results were coming. They came on this trip and we played well. We kind of found the mojo we had when we were healthy and were getting great goaltending.” UP NEXT Red Wings: Host Edmonton on Thursday. Ducks: At Nashville on Tuesday. ___ AP NHL: ","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S6FU3WVN3II65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S6FU3WVN3II65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S6FU3WVN3II65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S6FU3WVN3II65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S6FU3WVN3II65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S6FU3WVN3II65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2024/01/07/red-wings-ducks-score/9bf3122c-adda-11ee-9a32-5c9e6aa28b3b_story.html,Washington Post,2024-01-07 23:48:00,

HOUSTON — Fun just spent the football season hanging out in Seattle. It lavished itself among Washington wide receivers who had the fun and — get this — shared the fun. That group became arguably the best in the land at any position, treating Huskies spectators to an untold helping of fun as quarterback  . Just the numbers, even when read from afar, made it look as if a team in the upper left corner of the country was having more fun than everybody else: 1,553 yards of catches for Rome Odunze, 1,122 for Ja’Lynn Polk, 526 for Jalen McMillan even as injury gutted his season, 419 for Germie Bernard, 391 for tight end Jack Westover and more beyond that. What an absurd amount of fun. Now, in a sport that has spent this century throwing the ball around like mad, this purple shade of fun goes cascading all the way to the closing Monday night against an old prude, a Michigan defense so superb at doing the job of a defense: scuttling fun. Michigan ranks No. 1 in the country in yards allowed per game, No. 1 in points allowed, No. 4 in yards allowed per play and No. 2 in passing yards allowed per game. Fans of its opponents had so little fun. That makes the Washington receivers vs. the Michigan secondary a veritable football art festival, a place for curious eyeballs to dart and the highlight of this fresh, refreshing national championship game. “A great opportunity for the DBs,” Michigan defensive back Mike Sainristil said Saturday, “to show we can cover these guys.” “It’s probably, as a group, the best corps of receivers we’ve faced,” all-Big Ten cornerback Will Johnson said. “We’re going to have a tough time on Monday,” said JaMarcus Shephard, the Washington wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator, a charismatic 40-year-old from Indiana. “It’s going to be tough sledding. I hope we can find a way to get open at some point and make a play. Hopefully we can make the play somewhere. In the game plan, it was hard to find a lot of things — anything — that they didn’t do very well. They do it   well.” All season long, the Washington receivers rang up their numbers even while acknowledging how the country hardly knows them. “That’s something I’ve been trying to answer,” Odunze said Saturday, “my family’s been trying to answer, the West Coast has been trying to answer for a long time.” Some purple people might chafe how the Biletnikoff Award for best wideout went to Ohio State’s Marvin Harrison Jr. for his 67 catches for 1,211 yards and 14 touchdowns over Odunze and his 87 for 1,553 and 13. All the while, Odunze had something that might count as rare among receivers: position group camaraderie. As explained by Shephard, who played wideout at DePauw, the position at times generates the least cohesion of all groups. “I think [offensive] line kind of naturally [bonds] because they’re in the trenches,” he said. “A quarterback room, there’s a bond because there’s a level of expectation to them, you know, that they kind of feel like at times it’s us against the world. Defense just kind of has to have that. Receiver’s one of those tough ones where the ball is thrown and you know the ball is either coming to you or not coming to you, and we expect you to still perform everything as if the ball’s coming to you every single time. … I try to implement within the group this identity aspect that everybody eats, and when you catch a pass it really affects everybody in the whole room.” Washington, by informed accounts, is something beyond its splashy numbers. “I think that [the receivers’] purpose matches what our team’s purpose and culture is,” offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb said. “And so I think that’s sometimes rare in the receiving room. And I realize the ball is getting spread around, everybody’s getting a little bit of love, but I do think that there can be an element where jealousy and things like that can set in. … But for our guys, they’re unified. They play together. They feed off of each other. They celebrate each other’s success.” As Shephard put it, “It does take a village.” So they soared. They mattered deeply in making Penix the Heisman Trophy runner-up and the benefactor of Sainristil’s compliment as “a quarterback who can dice you up.” They majored in snaring contested balls, which should add some intrigue Monday. And, importantly, they vary. The 6-foot-1, 192-pound McMillan, Shephard said, “can really feel space and understand the defense,” while the 6-3, 215-pound Odunze can go up and take the ball from just about anyone else as well as “run through somebody,” and the 6-2, 204-pound Polk has strong hands and “all the routes with different double moves and things of that nature in the offense.” Together, they can match the most highbrow receiving corps of the playoff era, such as those at Alabama and Ohio State, even if they didn’t get nearly as much attention. They’ve had themselves a ball, and now they’ll face the thorniest test to see how much fun they can have.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WLSXXSCQWJ3HL3HUH2Y6WCMB34.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WLSXXSCQWJ3HL3HUH2Y6WCMB34.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WLSXXSCQWJ3HL3HUH2Y6WCMB34.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WLSXXSCQWJ3HL3HUH2Y6WCMB34.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WLSXXSCQWJ3HL3HUH2Y6WCMB34.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WLSXXSCQWJ3HL3HUH2Y6WCMB34.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/07/washington-receivers-michigan-secondary-cfp-matchup-to-watch/,Washington Post,2024-01-07 06:00:00,
"ROME — Pope Francis called Monday for a global ban on surrogate motherhood, equating it with child trafficking in remarks at a meeting with ambassadors to the Vatican and adding fuel to efforts in Italy to pass the West’s most restrictive law on a practice used by infertile and same-sex couples to become parents. ROME — Pope Francis called Monday for a global ban on surrogate motherhood, equating it with child trafficking in remarks at a meeting with ambassadors to the Vatican and adding fuel to efforts in Italy to pass the West’s most restrictive law on a practice used by infertile and same-sex couples to become parents. “I deem deplorable the practice of so-called surrogate motherhood, which represents a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child, based on the exploitation of situations of the mother’s material needs,” Francis said in  . “A child is always a gift and never the basis of a commercial contract. Consequently, I express my hope for an effort by the international community to prohibit this practice universally.” The pope portrayed surrogacy as a particularly Western problem, and a “culture of death” that “discards children, the elderly and the sick.” Francis has been embraced by liberals for his outreach to the LGBTQ+ community and focus on migrants, the poor and global warming. But he has upheld conservative church positions on reproductive health, taking stands against surrogacy, in vitro fertilization and  . In 2022, he compared surrogacy — or “womb renting,” as he called it — with pornography, calling them “threats to human dignity.” He has spoken repeatedly of surrogacy as exploitation of women in poverty, part of a world in which the poor are victimized by commodity-driven and overly commercialized Western culture. On Monday, Francis additionally reiterated his position against “gender theory,” which he described as “extremely dangerous.” Overall, the speech represented a rundown of global issues that Francis has sought to put on diplomatic agendas, including a cease-fire in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, lingering humanitarian crises in Africa and rising tensions in Latin America. The  that the practice of surrogacy can make children into commodities, but it has called for global safeguards rather than a ban. Many countries in Europe outlaw surrogacy, or allow it only in “altruistic” cases, in which a relative or close friend is willing to serve as the surrogate without monetary compensation. Europeans seeking surrogate mothers have often sought them in the United States and, before the outbreak of war, in Ukraine. In Italy, far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is pushing to expand an existing ban on surrogacy to impose jail time and large fines for parents who seek to have children through surrogate mothers overseas. In May, Meloni appeared alongside Francis at an event against Italy’s “demographic winter,” where she condemned surrogacy and called it no solution. “Motherhood is not for sale … wombs are not for rent and children are not over-the-counter products that you can choose on the shelf as if you were in the supermarket and maybe return it if the product does not match what you expected,”   at the time. Pro-surrogacy groups criticized the pope’s comments on Monday as aiding Meloni’s proposed law. “Of course it’ll have political consequences in Italy,” said Susanna Lollini, a member of the legal team of Famiglie Arcobaleno, an LGBTQ+ parents association. “The ruling right doesn’t really care about the pope or religion, but it’s useful to say: ‘The pope asked for this.’”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6XLPBAKLXONCDBYC6Z34HO4UY.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6XLPBAKLXONCDBYC6Z34HO4UY.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6XLPBAKLXONCDBYC6Z34HO4UY.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6XLPBAKLXONCDBYC6Z34HO4UY.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6XLPBAKLXONCDBYC6Z34HO4UY.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6XLPBAKLXONCDBYC6Z34HO4UY.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/08/pope-francis-calls-surrogacy-deplorable-calls-global-ban/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 15:08:00,
"Republican polling leader   returned Tuesday to the federal courthouse in Washington where he was arraigned in August on charges of interfering with the 2020 election results, making a voluntary appearance just before the Iowa caucuses and later reprising his threats of potential unrest over his legal entanglements. Republican polling leader   returned Tuesday to the federal courthouse in Washington where he was arraigned in August on charges of interfering with the 2020 election results, making a voluntary appearance just before the Iowa caucuses and later reprising his threats of potential unrest over his legal entanglements. Speaking to reporters after an   in which Trump’s lawyers said he should be immune from prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election, Trump claimed without evidence that he was being prosecuted because of polls showing him leading  . He warned that if the charges succeed in damaging his candidacy, the result would be “bedlam.” His choice to observe the oral argument in his appeal to make him immune from prosecution instead of spending more time in Iowa six days ahead of the GOP’s first nominating contest there reflected the bet he and his campaign are placing on blending his criminal defense with his electoral message. Tuesday’s appearance is poised to be the first of many times this year that he quickly pivots between the courtroom and the campaign trail — or brings the campaign to the courthouse steps, as he faces four separate criminal cases and two civil trials. Both in campaign speeches and legal filings, Trump, who polls well ahead in Iowa and other early states, is seeking to portray the criminal charges and civil proceedings he faces as political attacks — a tactic his campaign successfully used to consolidate support in the Republican primary, but one that faces a murkier political outlook in a general election. In a fundraising email that distorted the situation, Trump misleadingly claimed to supporters that Biden was “forcing me into a courtroom” and distracting him from campaign strategizing. Attending an appellate oral argument is not uncommon but not required. Tuesday’s appearance is the first of two courtroom trips Trump will be making this week. On Thursday, Trump is expected to attend closing arguments at his civil fraud trial in New York. Spokespeople for his two main Republican rivals, Florida Gov.   and former U.N. ambassador , did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s decision to spend Tuesday in court instead of campaigning. Both have indirectly blamed Trump’s legal challenges for distracting him from voters’ concerns, creating too much drama and chaos, or hurting his ability to beat Biden in November. “Chaos follows him,” Haley said at a Fox News town hall Monday night. “And y’all know I’m right.” But such arguments have not shaken his grip on the race, reinforcing a view on Trump’s team that court appearances can function as well or even better than traditional campaign events. Trump intended Tuesday’s appearance to show seriousness and defiance in a faceoff with special counsel Jack Smith, according to people close to the former president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. They said he sees showing up to court as a way to go on the offense and steal the national news spotlight. “We are not going to allow them to have any free shots on goal,” one adviser said. “If they want to try and make this their play, we’re going to fight back at every opportunity.” The Trump campaign declined to comment. At Tuesday’s argument in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump’s lawyers, led by D. John Sauer, argued that the trial scheduled for March on Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election cannot proceed, either because he was already acquitted by Congress in a 2021 impeachment, or because he has immunity for all actions taken as president. The trial judge, Tanya S. Chutkan, rejected that claim, ruling that serving as president “does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass.” The three-judge panel — consisting of two Biden appointees, J. Michelle Childs and Florence Y. Pan, and one George H.W. Bush appointee, Karen L. Henderson — heard the case after the Supreme Court declined Smith’s request for them to immediately decide the question. No court has ever considered the question before because Trump is the first former president to be indicted. The judges   that presidential immunity extended as far as Trump’s lawyers claimed, as well as questioning their claim that Trump’s actions were within the scope of his official duty. “I think it’s paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care [that] the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate federal laws,” Henderson said. Trump sat impassively through most of the argument, with a few exceptions. As the hearing wore on, he became slightly more animated, shaking his head when prosecutor James Pearce raised the possibility of “tit-for-tat” political retribution. Twice he nodded as his lawyer spoke: first when Sauer said that the conduct in the case occurred while Trump was president, and again when Sauer talked of a “frightening future” if presidents could readily be charged with crimes after they left office. “Joe would be ripe for indictment,” Trump said in a video posted to social media late Monday. “He has to be careful because that can happen to him also.” Smith also attended the argument. In Iowa, where Trump campaigned Saturday and plans to return for a Wednesday televised town hall, there is no indication that he is paying any political price for taking time away from the trail, despite the tradition of steep expectations for up-close, in-person attention. “He can’t come here as much as he wants to because he’s tied up with the justice system, something he cannot help,” said Bob Carlson, a semiretired surgeon in Muscatine who attended a Trump event in Clinton on Saturday and plans on caucusing for the former president. Over the weekend, a precinct captain for DeSantis   the Florida governor to stay in the race despite trailing in Iowa “because the first person might be in jail.” DeSantis replied, “I agree with you.” Trump has told advisers he thinks he gets better news coverage and more deference from the legal system when he attends proceedings in person and that it has been a mistake in the past to skip certain court dates. “No one’s going to be talking about whatever else is going on in the news on Tuesday,” another campaign adviser said. Besides wanting to get media attention, Trump also simply likes to be there, another person close to him said. He likes to see the proceedings for himself, hear the arguments his team is making, confer with them during breaks and “have some control of the situation,” this person said. “He doesn’t like to delegate.” The court appearance brought Trump back to the scene of the crime, as the courthouse faces the Capitol’s west front, a few days after the third anniversary of the  , 2021, riot. The   does not accuse Trump of inciting the riot, as his impeachment did, but it alleges that he and co-conspirators exploited the disruption to try to further delay the formal certification of Trump’s electoral loss. When Trump last appeared at the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse for his arraignment in August, protesters and counterprotesters filled the surrounding streets to greet his motorcade with taunts, signs, cellphone cameras or sometimes solemn silence. On Tuesday wet weather kept away crowds outside the courthouse. A few protesters gathered around the courthouse steps holding anti-Trump signs, while one across the street played circus music. Trump raised a similar immunity defense in a   seeking to dismiss state charges in Atlanta alleging criminal election interference. Trump is facing 13 charges in Georgia, including violating the  , soliciting a public officer to violate their oath, conspiring to impersonate a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery in the first degree and conspiring to file false documents. He pleaded not guilty. In New York, where Trump will go Thursday, state Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump, his company and four current and former executives there including his adult sons. James has asked for a $370 million fine plus interest, representing ill-gotten gains that Trump and the other defendants allegedly received through a practice of deceiving lenders and insurance companies for a decade. New York Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron, who oversaw the bench trial, already ruled the defendants committed fraud and must now determine whether specific illegal acts occurred. Engoron has already determined that business certificates for Trump entities in the state will be canceled and a receiver appointed, and could still impose a monitor and further limit the Trump Organization’s ability to operate in New York when he decides the rest of the case.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VR2WWBUAJD72ELALCN5OAG6M3M.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VR2WWBUAJD72ELALCN5OAG6M3M.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VR2WWBUAJD72ELALCN5OAG6M3M.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VR2WWBUAJD72ELALCN5OAG6M3M.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VR2WWBUAJD72ELALCN5OAG6M3M.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VR2WWBUAJD72ELALCN5OAG6M3M.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/trump-courtroom-campaign-president-iowa/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 09:30:00,

It is the largest contract in franchise history by total value and includes a no-movement clause. The 27-year-old right wing has 21 goals and 33 assists through 37 games this season. Toronto drafted Nylander eighth overall in the 2014 draft. He has 198 goals and 286 assists over 558 career games with the Maple Leafs with a plus-28 defensive rating. Nylander was set to become an unrestricted free agent in the offseason.

Defenseman Morgan Rielly is also is in the second year of an eight-year contract worth $7.5 million a season. Those five players account for more than 60 percent of the Maple Leafs’ salary cap space.

The two sides came to an agreement before his current deal, signed in 2018, came to an end.

"Over the past three years of Michigan football’s charmed existence, the program’s long-awaited breakthroughs —  ,   and   — suddenly became routine. Those feats, repeated each season since 2021, appeased restless fans who had longed for marquee moments the program had lacked amid an otherwise strong run under Coach Jim Harbaugh. Over the past three years of Michigan football’s charmed existence, the program’s long-awaited breakthroughs —  ,   and   — suddenly became routine. Those feats, repeated each season since 2021, appeased restless fans who had longed for marquee moments the program had lacked amid an otherwise strong run under Coach Jim Harbaugh. The Wolverines now have their biggest opportunity in decades: a chance Monday to win a national title, the program’s first since 1997. But beneath the glory of Michigan’s most prominent college team and despite the legions of maize-wearing football fanatics, the state’s grass-roots tackle football participation is declining. Over the past decade, nearly every state’s high school football participation rate has fallen, according to a recent Washington Post   of survey data from the National Federation of State High School Associations. And Michigan’s drop of about 13 percent, adjusted for public high school enrollment, is larger than that of the nation as a whole (10 percent). Many other states — including Washington, home of Michigan’s opponent Monday — have had similar participation declines. Experts blame the downward trend on safety concerns because of the game’s link to brain damage as well as sport specialization, digital distractions and the rise in the number of activities available to children. In Michigan, roughly 7,700 fewer high school boys played 11-man football in 2022 than a decade earlier — a staggering drop that is larger than the loss of participants in every state except California and North Carolina. The number of students at public high schools in Michigan has also fallen, and the state’s football talent pool remains large — more than 32,000 high school players, the eighth most in the country — because of its relatively high population. High-schoolers in Michigan still play football at a rate slightly higher than in the nation as a whole. But it’s an uneven landscape,  , with some small-town schools struggling to field teams, leading to canceled games and seasons, while powerhouse programs continue to produce elite prospects. Aaron Marshall has had the luxury of coaching at programs where roster size hasn’t been an issue. He recently left suburban powerhouse Southfield High outside of Detroit, where he won the state championship this past fall, to take over head coaching duties at Brother Rice in nearby Bloomfield Hills, a storied program with nine state titles since 1977. But dwindling statewide participation in the sport has still affected his teams. “Every year, my freshman team has had to find [an opponent] because the team we were playing that week didn’t have a freshman team,” Marshall said. “I see it happening more every year. It’s like, ‘Oh, there goes another school that dropped freshman football.’ ” At Eaton Rapids High, in a town of just over 5,000 people, Coach Wayne Dismuke scrambled to recruit enough players ahead of the 2023 season — a “very difficult” task, he said, as boys in his community choose other sports over football or join the workforce. “I do feel like if we don’t get behind this, eventually high school football could phase out [in] certain states,” said Dismuke, whose varsity team of about 22 players finished 1-8. Some schools have shifted to eight-man football amid the participation decline; Michigan had around 2,600 high school boys play that version of the sport in 2022, nearly four times as many participants as a decade earlier. Meanwhile, the state’s high school basketball participation has hardly budged. Nationally, football participation nearly doubles that of boys’ basketball, but in Michigan, there were just 1.6 football players for every basketball player in 2022. (In some southern states, such as South Carolina, Texas and Georgia, football had close to three times as many participants as basketball.) Football’s declining youth participation, in Michigan and elsewhere, stands in stark contrast to the college and professional game’s massive audience. The University of Michigan led the NCAA in 2023 with an average attendance of nearly 110,000 at home games, and the   over Alabama in the Rose Bowl garnered 27.2 million viewers,  . “Our community loves football,” said Tim Wooer, the coach at Kingsley High in a rural part of northern Michigan. “Schools that are thriving, and even where they’re struggling — there’s still a love for the game of football in the state of Michigan.” Michigan’s falling football participation probably won’t affect the prominent in-state college programs because there are still plenty of sought-after recruits locally and more than 1 million high school players nationally. Plus, the athletes a team targets in recruiting are influenced by the coaching staff’s regional ties, the success of the program and the reach of the team’s brand. Just before Harbaugh took over at Michigan in 2015, in-state athletes accounted for about 43 percent of the roster and three-quarters of the players were from Midwestern states. Harbaugh has transformed the roster into one with just 24 percent of players from Michigan and 42 percent from the Midwest. Harbaugh has far fewer in-state players than Michigan State, which trails the Wolverines in terms of recent and historical success. “I think [Harbaugh] just wants the best players, period,” said Marshall, the coach at Brother Rice. “It’s more a matter of ‘Let’s get the best kids, no matter where they are’ — because he has that kind of recruiting budget. And when you’re competing against the Alabamas and Georgias and Ohio States — those teams have unlimited recruiting budgets — you have to be right there with them to compete.” In general, the more successful college programs are better able to attract prospects nationwide, and a wide net in recruiting gives coaches a deeper pool of top high school players. Thomas Wilcher, who coached Detroit powerhouse Cass Technical High for 24 years and then served as Michigan State’s director of community and high school relations until last year, said: “I’m not saying Michigan schools shouldn’t choose Michigan athletes. If Michigan comes to [sign] you, they want you because you can play there. But you want to be diverse, and you have to look at who fits your program. It’s a numbers game.” The Wolverines lean on some in-state players, but this year’s roster was largely built with far-flung pieces: a quarterback from outside Chicago, a prolific running back from Virginia, a defensive back who was born in Haiti and grew up in Massachusetts, a defensive standout from California and so on. And with those players at the forefront, Michigan became one of just four schools   from the South to reach the championship game in the playoff era. Michigan’s roster construction, some high school coaches said, might simply be the byproduct of the program’s ambition to land the nation’s top players. But the state’s falling participation — tumbling at a rate faster than the country’s as a whole — could gradually weaken the pool of nearby talent. “If the market is smaller, there’s probably less opportunity to pull from,” said Adam Korzeniewski, Williams’s predecessor as Brother Rice’s coach and now the school’s associate athletic director. “Could that be coupled with [Michigan] having the resources to go outside the state and turn over every stone? Sure. But there’s no question that, if the market you’re operating in is a shrinking market, you’re probably going to take more kids from out of market.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HMPYGOG635JPX5J4RB32KS4O7U_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HMPYGOG635JPX5J4RB32KS4O7U_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HMPYGOG635JPX5J4RB32KS4O7U_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HMPYGOG635JPX5J4RB32KS4O7U_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HMPYGOG635JPX5J4RB32KS4O7U_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HMPYGOG635JPX5J4RB32KS4O7U_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/07/michigan-tackle-football-participation/,Washington Post,2024-01-07 09:00:00,
"Midway through the third quarter of a 70-61 victory over Maret on Saturday, with the win already within their grasp, the players on Georgetown Prep’s bench erupted into applause. The source of their excitement and pride was a five-second call, that rare defensive feat earned by the right amount of energy and effort. Midway through the third quarter of a 70-61 victory over Maret on Saturday, with the win already within their grasp, the players on Georgetown Prep’s bench erupted into applause. The source of their excitement and pride was a five-second call, that rare defensive feat earned by the right amount of energy and effort. The Hoyas played well all afternoon against the Frogs at Georgetown Day School, steadily growing their lead with some smooth playmaking and execution. But nothing got the team quite as excited as that five-second call. “Those types of little plays are huge. They spark everything for us,” junior guard Akbar Waheed III said. “We harp on grit a lot. We always want to be the tougher team. We want that to be our identity as a group.” The meeting between No. 8 Georgetown Prep (10-2) and Maret (10-3) was one of the more intriguing matchups in Saturday’s IAC/MAC Challenge, an annual day-long event that pits programs from the Interstate Athletic Conference against challengers from the Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference. The private school leagues are consistently home to some of themost talented teams in the D.C. area. Both schools fared well last month against an eclectic nonconference slate, and they entered Saturday’s showcase looking for another quality win before league play begins in earnest. But the Hoyas set themselves apart, especially in the second quarter. After a back-and-forth first, Prep turned in eight minutes of dominant basketball, outscoring Maret 17-5 to grab hold of the game. “Things just started clicking more,” senior guard RJ Stewart said. “We started sharing the ball a bit more, getting good shots. Not only were the shots falling, but we were also getting after it on defense.” Even in the second half, as the Hoyas led by double digits until the final minute, they refused to slow their pace, pressing until the end. Waheed led the Hoyas with 18 points, followed by junior forward Tyler Garrett with 13 and Stewart with 11. Georgetown Prep can now turn its attention to IAC play, in which Bullis looks to be its main competitor for the league title. Hoyas Coach Howard Blue is well aware it will take plenty more energy and effort for his team to have a shot at success. “The IAC is filled with really good teams, with really good coaches, playing very different styles,” Blue said. “Every single game that’s played today, you had IAC coaches out there watching and game-planning. It’s like a college atmosphere here in the IAC.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWP2CLM7MJBGBKMWSKVGHCXAVA.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWP2CLM7MJBGBKMWSKVGHCXAVA.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWP2CLM7MJBGBKMWSKVGHCXAVA.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWP2CLM7MJBGBKMWSKVGHCXAVA.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWP2CLM7MJBGBKMWSKVGHCXAVA.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FWP2CLM7MJBGBKMWSKVGHCXAVA.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/georgetown-prep-wins-energy-effort/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 15:32:00,

Former president  , the subject of an interview that aired on Monday evening, needs no context. His interviewer may: Lou Dobbs, a fixture in conservative media for decades until his Fox Business show was   by the channel after he was targeted in a defamation case focused on claims he’d made about the 2020 presidential election. Dobbs was   of Trumpian politics even before Trump arrived on the scene; he’s been a devoted supporter of Trump since. In 2022, a Rolling Stone report indicated that Trump might  , should he win reelection this year. Since Dobbs was fired by Fox, you might be wondering where the interview was hosted. The answer is that Dobbs’s show was resurrected for “Lindell TV,” which you have only heard of if you are a deeply dedicated student of the American fringe. It is, as you might expect, a product of pillow-salesman-turned-Trump-promoting-conspiracy-theorist Mike Lindell, a sort of YouTube for the tinfoil-hat set. So Lindell, whose identity is now enveloped in his support for Trump, hired Dobbs (pretty much the same) to interview Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Far from resulting in a bland exchange of pleasantries, though, the format allowed Trump to let down his guard, to whatever extent it’s ever up. He approached it as he would a rally speech, offering expected, worn-smooth rhetoric that he’s presented many times before. (Trump is in his Vegas-residency era, mostly playing his most popular hits for the crowd.) But, feeding off Dobbs’s support, he couldn’t help taking things   further, meaning that he ended up making news when he probably didn’t intend to. One example went viral soon after the interview began. “We have an economy that’s so fragile, and the only reason it’s running now is it’s running off the fumes of what we did. What the Trump admin — it’s just running off the fumes,” Trump said. “And when there’s a crash, I hope it’s going to be during this next 12 months. Because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover.” (History will probably suggest that he’s more like Woodrow Wilson, but that’s another story.) Obviously, blithely suggesting that a crash is coming and he hopes it happens under his likely opponent in November is not the sort of America-boosterism we tend to expect from  . But it’s not new for Trump, certainly, whose politics are based on presenting as bleak a picture of a non-Trump-led America as he can. In 2016 and 2020, he said similar things. “You’ll end up winning okay, we’re going to blame them.” Stuff like that. (Two years later, he would claim that he   the crash that he suggested would come.) Trump also said something else that received less attention. “I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China,” he told Dobbs, referring to the tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports. “No president ever took in 10 cents. It was a one-way deal.” “And I changed things around a lot,” he continued. “A lot of people think that’s why we had the China virus, frankly, because they never had a problem like they did with me. But I don’t think so. I think it was gross incompetence at the Wuhan lab.” “There are those people that said they would have done anything to get rid of me,” he said a bit later. It’s been a while, so we should first point out that the brunt of the negative effects of the tariffs — fees imposed on products imported from China — was borne by American consumers. A study   in May 2019 found that 95 percent of the costs of the tariffs were paid by Americans. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York   that American households were paying an additional $800 a year thanks to the fees. We should also note that Trump signed a deal with Chinese leaders in early 2020 committing China to buying an additional $200 billion in exports from America. (The total increase by the end of the deal?  .) When the coronavirus emerged soon afterward, Trump repeatedly downplayed it — in part   with whom he’d just made that deal. Now, though, everything has changed. The pandemic was a horrifying disaster, and Trump is eager to have people think that none of it was his fault. He was a quick adopter of the idea that the virus was demonstrably a function of activity in a lab in Wuhan, China — in part because renewed scrutiny of the lab allows him to claim that he was “proven right,” one of his favorite rhetorical tactics while in political exile. (It’s been a fascinating social experiment, seeing how careful picking of cherries can seemingly prove anyone to have been a Nostradamus in their own time.) He told Dobbs that he doesn’t think covid was a punishment for tariffs. But this is how his library of defenses is built: He tests the waters and sees the response. This line takes him from “China is doing its best” to “it was China’s fault not mine” to “China, unlike me, was incompetent” to “China was mad because I was so anti-China” — a transition that fits his needs coming into 2024. At another point, he tried to turn   into the pro-China guy, claiming, falsely, that Biden “got millions of dollars from China.” He also pointed to China’s role in fentanyl production — so being seen as the guy who China is desperate to keep out of power is useful as he talks to Republican primary voters. It’s all nonsense, as you might expect from a conversation between Trump and a guy fired by   for going to far, hosted on a fake news channel created by a pillow salesman. But Trump has a good shot of being president by this month next year, so it’s worth making very clear that what he’s saying is nonsense and why he’s saying it.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNW5CIAYMEI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNW5CIAYMEI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNW5CIAYMEI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNW5CIAYMEI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNW5CIAYMEI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNW5CIAYMEI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/trump-china-covid-dobbs-interview/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 10:48:00,

PHILADELPHIA — Evgeni Malkin had a goal and an assist to lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 4-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers in a scrappy contest on Monday night. Rickard Rakell, Erik Karlsson and Chad Ruhwedel also scored for Pittsburgh, and Alex Nedeljkovic made 36 saves. “I thought we got better as the night went on,” Nedeljkovic said. Owen Tippett scored for the Flyers, who have lost seven of nine. “They were the better team,” Philadelphia coach John Tortorella said. “We weren’t good enough in either end.” The game was feisty between the in-state rivals, with several scrums around the net and in the corners after plays. The teams combined for 11 penalties that totaled 24 minutes. Pittsburgh’s Kris Letang was bloodied 5:43 into the third after he threw Philadelphia’s Garnet Hathaway to the ice before getting a stick in the face from Nicolas Deslauriers. Twenty-six seconds later, Scott Laughton and Malkin were scuffling along the back boards. The Flyers honored their late founder and owner Ed Snider on Saturday, and Snider certainly would have approved of the physical play from the Flyers, whose tough fighting style earned them the nickname “Broad Street Bullies” when they won back-to-back Stanley Cups during Snider’s tenure in 1974 and ’75. Perhaps Philadelphia was showing its frustration after Malkin capitalized on a turnover by defenseman Egor Zamula and netted his 15th of the season 4:29 into the third to put Pittsburgh comfortably in front 4-1. “We’ve been playing really well as of late and it makes it easy, makes it fun,” Nedeljkovic said. “That’s how you want to play.” The Penguins will have a chance to even the four-game season series when they host Philadelphia in the final contest between the teams on Feb. 25. Rakell opened the scoring just 45 seconds into the contest with a power-play tally after an early tripping penalty on Sean Couturier. Karlsson’s shot from long range through a screen almost seven minutes later beat goalie Carter Hart, who made 36 stops. Tippett got the Flyers on the board with 5:05 left in the first period with a rare power-play goal for Philadelphia. The Flyers entered last in the league by converting on just 10.2% (13 of 128) of their chances this season. But Tippett finished on a wrist shot from the right circle after a beautiful setup from Zamula. “We’re just struggling scoring,” Tortorella said. “We don’t have enough people going offensively.” A   in the first period. The Flyers acquired defenseman Jamie Drysdale and a second-round pick in 2025 from Anaheim for high-scoring college left wing Cutter Gauthier. UP NEXT Penguins: Host Vancouver on Thursday.

TJ Houshmandzadeh, a former NFL wide receiver who was working as an unpaid assistant coach, recalled looking at fellow assistants and thinking to himself, “AP’s crazy.” His team was up 54 points at halftime, and Antonio Pierce was fuming. He had watched his team, one of the best in the country, play haphazardly on both sides of the ball. So Pierce gathered his Long Beach Polytechnic High players behind the bleachers and demanded they run sprints. TJ Houshmandzadeh, a former NFL wide receiver who was working as an unpaid assistant coach, recalled looking at fellow assistants and thinking to himself, “AP’s crazy.” Pierce soon let Houshmandzadeh and the team know there was nothing crazy about meeting a standard. The score didn’t matter. An inferior opponent didn’t matter. The outcome of this game wasn’t going to carry over, but the sloppy play just might. They ran so long and so hard that his players were too exhausted to reach the field to start the second half, leading to a penalty. But Long Beach Poly had enough gas to still beat Compton,  . “They were blowing this team out, but nah,” Houshmandzadeh said. “It’s about how I want things done. That was the message: ‘Do things the right way.’ ” Pierce, 45, is now in his final week as the interim coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, a franchise that has spent much of the past four decades trying to return to a championship standard set by its late patriarch, Al Davis. That wasn’t going to happen this season, during which the Raiders started 3-5 and ousted their coach, Josh McDaniels, thrusting Pierce, the team’s second-year linebackers coach, into the temporary gig. Pierce, in his eight games, has one more win than McDaniels despite relying on a rookie quarterback and missing star running back Josh Jacobs, the NFL’s leading rusher last season, for three games with a thigh injury. The Raiders’ defense ranks first at 16.3 points per game and has a league-best four defensive touchdowns since Pierce’s promotion. He also snapped a six-game skid to the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas and tacked a franchise-record 63 points on the Los Angeles Chargers. “If you can lead, you can lead,” said Houshmandzadeh, who spent four seasons on Pierce’s staff and remains close. “It doesn’t matter the age or the level. Guys know when you BSing them. Guys know what is what. The players are showing you what they think of him.” All-pros   and   have openly lobbied for Pierce to keep his job, with Adams declaring he was willing to “run through a wall for that man” — after one game. It’s a familiar storyline for Black NFL coaches. They are vastly underrepresented among the league’s head coaches and coordinators,  . But they are better represented among the league’s interim coaches, The Post found, a trend also seen in corporate America, where experts say women and people of color are often asked to lead in times of crisis. Pierce is the 28th Black head coach, interim or full time, in NFL history. But the interim route rarely leads to a full-time gig. Doug Marrone is the most recent interim coach to be retained for the full-time job, taking over the Jacksonville Jaguars in December 2016 before guiding the team for the next four seasons. Only three of the previous 15 Black interim coaches were retained for the next season and none since Romeo Crennel in 2012.   than his predecessor had in both of his full seasons with the Carolina Panthers — and even he wasn’t retained. “At the end of day, everything will be looked at by wins and losses, and I think that’s fair and that’s what this business is about,” Pierce told reporters this week. “But I do also think it’s about what do you build in the foundation? And I think for the most part in these eight or nine weeks, it’s been a solid foundation that we’ve built as a team and as an organization.” Pierce was two weeks shy of his 11th birthday in 1989 when Davis made Art Shell the NFL’s first Black head coach in the modern era. Shell was a midseason replacement but was interim in name only. Davis wanted a Raider — an indoctrinated silver-and-black disciple. Shell had been a starting offensive lineman on three Super Bowl-winning teams and an offensive line coach for the franchise’s fourth. Although Pierce played in Washington and New York during his nine-year NFL career, he has a deep connection with the franchise. He grew up in Compton, Calif., when the Raiders called Los Angeles home. Pierce said he grew up enthralled by the team’s mystique, made all the more cool with the Raiders hats, jerseys and jackets donned by rap group NWA. “I was born a Raider,” he said during his introductory news conference. And his football career has been defined by bucking against what’s expected of him. He attended junior college before landing as a linebacker at Arizona. He went undrafted but retired as a Super Bowl champion and one-time Pro Bowl pick. Never being complacent has given Pierce that edge, which former NFL coach Marvin Lewis witnessed in 2002, when they first crossed paths in Washington. Before taking the job as Washington’s defensive coordinator, Lewis watched film of his soon-to-be players and found himself especially impressed by the undrafted rookie who could run, routinely made the right reads and always found himself in the action. Lewis devised a scheme in his nickel defense to maximize Pierce’s skills, but Pierce suffered a high ankle sprain in training camp. “He was frustrated, angry all the time, because he thought he was going to get cut,” Lewis said in a phone interview, “I was like, ‘Relax.’ ” Pierce played sporadically upon his return but emerged as one of the team’s leaders by his fourth season in Washington. And that didn’t change when Pierce landed in New York on a Giants defense that featured a Hall of Famer in Michael Strahan. That a player who lacked flashy credentials or pedigree was able to command respect from his peers doesn’t surprise Lewis because work ethic and commitment to a high standard have long carried more weight in a locker room. “Pros like pros,” Lewis said. After a neck injury forced him to retire in 2010, Pierce got into coaching when the athletic director at Long Beach Poly — where Pierce’s son DeAndre was playing — asked if he had any interest in taking over one of the more prestigious programs in the state. He spent four seasons there, assembling a staff that included former NFL players such as Houshmandzadeh, LaVar Arrington and Chris Claiborne before moving on to join former NFL coach Herm Edwards’s staff at Arizona State. Among his colleagues on that staff: Lewis. Their reunion allowed Lewis to see another side of Pierce — the one who could match wits on strategy and game-planning. Lewis was impressed with Pierce’s diligence but worried about overexertion. Pierce once came to Lewis during an open date and asked, “Hey, how am I doing?” “I said: ‘AP, now I know why you were such a good player and just so driven and so passionate about it. But just make sure you get your rest [and that] you’re taking a step back and smelling the roses a bit,’ ” said Lewis, who still gets calls from Pierce most mornings before the sun rises. “I think players respond to that, too, that they know he’s all-in. They know he’s not just collecting a check.” “He’s a guy that’s always searching for knowledge, for information,” Edwards said in a telephone interview, noting how in their four years together Pierce would often observe other college practices to study how they conducted business. “He’s a workaholic. He’s very detailed. Guys like that, it’s just a matter of time that they move up the ranks.” By dismissing McDaniels and general manager Dave Ziegler on Halloween and promoting Pierce and Champ Kelly as the interim general manager, Mark Davis made history:   to have three Black people occupying the most prominent leadership positions, with Sandra Douglass Morgan hired as team president in 2022. Davis has yet to hire a full-time Black head coach in 12 years running the organization, but he has fired one. Hue Jackson, the last coach Al Davis hired before his death in 2011, was dismissed after going 8-8 in his lone season with the Raiders. Since then, Davis has had more full-time head coaches than playoff appearances, with McDaniels, Jack Del Rio, Dennis Allen and Jon Gruden combining for one postseason trip. And Davis has made a few blunders with his hires. The Rooney Rule had to be reworked after Davis violated its spirit by hiring Gruden before firing Del Rio, interviewing two minority candidates before Gruden signed his contract. Davis then refused to retain Rich Bisaccia, who led the Raiders into the postseason as the interim coach in 2021 after  , nearly leading the team to an upset of the eventual AFC champion Cincinnati Bengals. “Maybe this time around he’ll understand: ‘Hey, I’ve got the guy right here. I don’t need to go outside,’ ” Lewis said of Mark Davis. Pierce’s status as a former NFL player has appeared to help his cause, giving him credibility in the locker room. Nine former players served as head coaches this season, including two who have experienced relative success in their first full-time stints: Dan Campbell, who led the Detroit Lions to their first division title in 30 years, and DeMeco Ryans, who became the 22nd full-time Black coach in NFL history last February and led the Houston Texans to the playoffs this season, clinching the berth with a victory Saturday night over the Indianapolis Colts. “Not saying you have to be a player to be a good coach,” Edwards said, “but that helps you. I think players gravitate toward him. When he’s talking to them, he has experience at that level so he understands.” Houshmandzadeh said that if Pierce is allowed to run it back next season, it could open up the coaching ranks for a different type of personality — a coach with a little swagger whose unabashed moxie inspires his players to puff victory cigars in the locker room. “What head coach you see wearing diamond earrings during the game? What head coach you know pull up in a 6-4 [Chevy Impala] on Daytons? He’s doing that,” Houshmandzadeh said with a laugh. “But he knows the game of football. A lot of former players don’t go into coaching because you’ve got to start at the basement when you pretty much know more than the coach that you start behind.

"HOUSTON — I remember the first notable play call of Jim Harbaugh’s coaching career. It happened in 1997, when he was still an NFL quarterback. And it was a touchdown, a fool-’em special that left me certain 27 years ago that Harbaugh was destined to be an exceptional coach. I was a 19-year-old college student at the time, so, you know, a lot of things seemed extraordinary. But Harbaugh, the Michigan coach vying for his first national title Monday night, had that “it” factor already. It wasn’t merely his football mind. It was the pigskin in his blood. HOUSTON — I remember the first notable play call of Jim Harbaugh’s coaching career. It happened in 1997, when he was still an NFL quarterback. And it was a touchdown, a fool-’em special that left me certain 27 years ago that Harbaugh was destined to be an exceptional coach. I was a 19-year-old college student at the time, so, you know, a lot of things seemed extraordinary. But Harbaugh, the Michigan coach vying for his first national title Monday night, had that “it” factor already. It wasn’t merely his football mind. It was the pigskin in his blood. At the time, Harbaugh was a volunteer assistant at Western Kentucky, where his father, Jack, was trying to resuscitate a program that came one board of regents vote shy of being eliminated five years earlier. Both of Jack’s sons hatched ideas to help their father. John, now the Baltimore Ravens’ coach, was then a college special teams coordinator at Cincinnati, and he would make lists of overlooked recruits who could thrive at Western Kentucky. Jim wooed those recruits, establishing a Florida pipeline that included quarterback Willie Taggart, who wound up a transformational star for the Hilltoppers before starting his 25-year coaching career. When the school needed uniforms, Jim leveraged his contract with sports apparel company Fila to assist. By 1997, he had become so influential in the program’s rebirth that Western Kentucky held “Jim Harbaugh Appreciation Night” to honor him. He came to celebrate during his bye week with the Indianapolis Colts, but on that Saturday night in late September, the competitor needed to do more than stand at midfield and absorb applause. The team ran a triple-option offense. Taggart threw just 131 passes in 12 games that season, and thinking back, it’s surprising he attempted that many. The Hilltoppers that night were scuffling through a game against South Florida. Thirty-five seconds before halftime, Jim suggested to his father and the offensive staff that they call the most un-Western Kentucky play in their book: a deep shot to fullback Jade Gummer. More than a quarter-century later, it’s not novel to throw a wheel route to a player dashing out of the backfield. But in 1997? To the fullback? In Bowling Green, Ky.? It felt like space exploration. Taggart completed the pass. Gummer huffed to the end zone. The play, which Jim helped install during practice that week, propelled Western Kentucky to a 31-3 victory. And shortly after the touchdown, the Jim Harbaugh appreciation ceremony commenced. “Whenever Jim would come to town, we were all excited because we knew we were getting some new passes installed,” said Taggart, who coaches the running backs for John’s Ravens and has been a head coach at Western Kentucky, South Florida, Oregon, Florida State and Florida Atlantic. “We’d be like: ‘We know this dude. He’s going to pass.’ Whatever he called, it worked. Jim is just different, man. He sees things differently, and it always works.” This was seven years before Jim became a head coach at the University of San Diego. He was starting for the Colts, who were 0-4 at the time and would start the 1997 season with 10 straight losses. Armed with the No. 1 pick in 1998, they drafted a savior in Peyton Manning. Jim moved on to the Ravens and the San Diego Chargers to end his playing career. He always knew life after football would include more football. He wanted to be like his dad. Digging into my old college notes, I found an interview with Jim from Sept. 27, 1997. “The biggest blessing I’ve ever had in my life is my mom and dad,” he said. “I look at my dad as a very honest, good person. I want to follow in his footsteps and be a coach someday. He’s my role model.” Jack, who led the Hilltoppers to a Division I-AA (now Football Championship Subdivision) title five years later, referred to that night as “the highlight of my coaching career.” So Jim’s noisy coaching tenure began so wholesome, so cute. No matter what has happened during his contentious journey, I must admit having a soft spot for the man. He’s so much more than a controversial and polarizing coach. He’s a family man full of quirks. But even amid the drama, there’s a decency to Jim and the entire Harbaugh family that, for people who know them, resonates through controversy. Jack is a foundational sports figure in my career. He’s 84 now and still loud, fiery and affectionate. His wife, Jackie (yes,   — sitcom worthy), is an even more joyful and infectious personality. When I graduated and covered the Philadelphia Eagles, John was the special teams coordinator and spent many Thursday afternoons checking in on me after his weekly media sessions. I don’t know Jim much, but he’s a Harbaugh. And I’ve been fortunate to see the best sides of this family. Sometimes it leads to inner conflict when writing opinions about the constant job rumors involving Jim or about the Wolverines being under investigation for  . But having to work through those emotions is actually a gift. It’s better to know and care about people than live in cynical isolation. Time has frayed memories of that play against South Florida. So a little exaggeration fills the gaps. Gummer thought it went for about 70 yards. When told it was 40, he laughed and said, “Each year, the play gets longer in my mind.” “Whatever it was, it was purely hustle,” Gummer added in full self-deprecation mode. “It was not at all athletic.” Gummer is a lawyer in Orlando. Taggart has worked as an assistant under Jack, Jim and John. Jim was the best man in his wedding. Taggart and his wife named their second son Jackson to honor his college coach. The Harbaughs all have first names that start with “J” — Jack, Jackie, John, Jim and daughter Joani (whose husband is longtime college basketball coach Tom Crean) — so they jokingly call Taggart “Jason.” “My whole life changed the day I met Jim Harbaugh,” said Taggart, who was with Jim at Stanford as the running backs coach. “The way I looked at football, the way I looked at life changed because of him.” Jim and John, both in their early 60s, are roughly the same age as their father was when Taggart and Gummer were at Western Kentucky. It’s eerie for both of them to observe the sons’ mannerisms, listen to their pet phrases and catch glimpses of the infamous Harbaugh scowl. Sometimes, they look just like their dad. When Jim wears glasses on the sideline,  . “I literally pause the games sometimes, and I can put the words in his mouth that he’s saying,” Gummer said. Taggart thinks back to Western Kentucky and can hear Jim, his future best man, challenging his father. “Do you not have any pass plays?” the fancy NFL quarterback would ask. Then Jack would let Jim show him something new. That’s how Jim Harbaugh coaches to this day, with a classic approach invigorated by creative ambition. His different perspective still works.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6U7ULF3ILMTYHIREMO6D4LN6E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6U7ULF3ILMTYHIREMO6D4LN6E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6U7ULF3ILMTYHIREMO6D4LN6E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6U7ULF3ILMTYHIREMO6D4LN6E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6U7ULF3ILMTYHIREMO6D4LN6E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6U7ULF3ILMTYHIREMO6D4LN6E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/jim-harbaugh-coaching-career-dad/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 06:10:00,

Sadly for the NBA, because Christmas — the holiday that the league uses for its showcase slate — fell on a Monday, three football games and even three pregame shows dwarfed a  . And with several division titles   and a surplus of teams still alive — amazingly,  representatives from the toilet water known as the   have something to play for — there are few games with low stakes this weekend. Just another reason the NFL will keep us in front of our screens, again, capturing all of our attention and all of the ratings. No doubt the NFL will eclipse its 2022 national revenue of  , shared among the 32 teams. No league has ever been so lucrative. No league has ever been so ruthless. That’s the word to best describe the Denver Broncos threatening to bench starting quarterback Russell Wilson in October if he   and address an injury guarantee tied to a $37 million offseason payment. And  — another word that comes to mind — as in the way the Indianapolis Colts granted three-time all-pro linebacker Shaquille Leonard the meeting in November he had requested to talk about playing time but the next day informed him that  . Also, let’s try  and  , which could describe the other 31 NFL team owners who refused to offer Lamar Jackson a contract this past offseason after the Baltimore Ravens  , which should’ve opened up a free agency bonanza for the superstar. All of these examples show why players want (and deserve) guaranteed money — and why owners are too shameless to give it. The disposability of the players, combined with the collusion between owners who at times have shown more loyalty to their billionaire peers than to their  , should make watching NFL games a dispiriting hobby, like another old tradition. In the post-#MeToo era, we’ve become less eager to watch women objectified in beauty contests, so the audience for the 100-plus-year-old “Miss America” pageant  . Typically, we grow out of established yet problematic institutions. We know better, then we do better. Yet with the NFL, we keep watching. Eliminated from the postseason for the eighth straight year, the Broncos will visit another Cabo-bound team in the Las Vegas Raiders this Sunday. That fact probably won’t matter to the viewing public in the Rockies. Nor, I imagine, will the Broncos decision-makers’ coldblooded treatment of Wilson douse enthusiasm for their Week 18 finale. Less than two years after kinging Wilson as their franchise quarterback and offering him  , the Broncos clearly have experienced buyer’s remorse. But rather than just releasing Wilson and eating the cost if he got injured (a Wal-Mart heir owns the Broncos; they can afford it), the team resorted to dirty tricks to try to protect its books. The threat to bench Wilson was illegal, according to   back in November. The threat, Kessler wrote, also violated the collective bargaining agreement. More so, the threat should have been eye-opening. If a team can strong-arm Wilson — a franchise quarterback (meaning he’s the most important player on the roster), a Super Bowl champion (meaning he’s a winner)   a Walter Payton Man of the Year honoree (meaning he’s the epitome of the type of player and citizen the NFL wants to highlight) — then everybody in an NFL locker room is expendable. As Leonard learned after that fateful meeting with the Colts. Just two seasons ago, Leonard, whose larger-than-life image graces the exterior of Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, was the heart and soul of the Colts’ defense, the punch-out specialist who led the league with eight forced fumbles. That season he earned first-team all-pro honors, but his body paid for it. Leonard missed all but three games in 2022 while recovering from back surgery. This season,  decreased because of his lack of explosiveness, though he felt he was close to being the player of 2021. He openly addressed this disappointment with reporters, and by November, the Colts responded. “It was shocking,” Leonard said the day he was cut. “I asked for a November meeting. I guess I got a November meeting. I guess you’ve got to be careful what you ask for.” But showing the ability to sprinkle kindness with their callousness, the Colts provided a parting gift to Leonard, updating the massive banner outside the stadium with a message: “ .” The Ravens never had to wish an extravagant goodbye to their main man Jackson because other teams clearly had no use for a franchise-altering, championship-chasing  . It’s beyond imagination that in a league that prioritizes quarterbacks, no other team worked a deal to get Jackson over the summer — even if it would have cost a ransom and even if it would have required two first-round draft picks. Or that teams such as the Atlanta Falcons, New York Giants and Washington Commanders could look at the 2019 most valuable player and honestly go, “ The only explanation that makes sense is the simplest one: collusion among NFL owners. If the history-making guaranteed   the Cleveland Browns gave Deshaun Watson made owners skittish, then their hesitancy showed in the lack of pursuit for Jackson. It eliminated a bidding war that should have eclipsed Watson’s numbers, and it allowed the Ravens to work out an extension with Jackson that included  . Not chump change, indeed, but not Watson money, either. Wilson, Leonard and Jackson will be just fine financially. They weren’t wronged to the extent that an average adult should harbor sympathy for their plight. They were, however, just more examples of how this filthy rich league treats the workers who make the NFL so fun. We tune in to watch if Wilson can still cook, to see Leonard run around like a maniac and to witness Jackson redefine the quarterback position. But being the giant that it is, the NFL and its teams toss their weight around, crushing any semblance of decency. And they will keep getting away with it, even under our watchful eyes.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXAUBQ435UKPSGQKD74TWACORQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXAUBQ435UKPSGQKD74TWACORQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXAUBQ435UKPSGQKD74TWACORQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXAUBQ435UKPSGQKD74TWACORQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXAUBQ435UKPSGQKD74TWACORQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXAUBQ435UKPSGQKD74TWACORQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/ruthless-nfl-everyone-is-disposable-everyone/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 09:00:00,

"For long stretches of this season, the Washington Capitals were stealing games. The term “character win” came up regularly as they somehow held strong while being outshot and outplayed to prevail — perhaps more often than they should have. In the six games before the NHL’s Christmas break, Washington went 3-1-2, and only one of those games —   Predators on Dec. 16 — was decided by more than one goal. The Capitals knew they were walking a dangerous path, but they were still picking up points along the way. For long stretches of this season, the Washington Capitals were stealing games. The term “character win” came up regularly as they somehow held strong while being outshot and outplayed to prevail — perhaps more often than they should have. In the six games before the NHL’s Christmas break, Washington went 3-1-2, and only one of those games —   Predators on Dec. 16 — was decided by more than one goal. The Capitals knew they were walking a dangerous path, but they were still picking up points along the way. In Washington’s six games since the break, the season has taken an ugly turn. Washington is 1-4-1 while being outscored by 15 goals; the Capitals’ goal differential this season has fallen to minus-24, second worst in the Eastern Conference entering Saturday. In their lone win of this stretch,   on Tuesday, the Capitals grabbed a 4-0 lead in the first period and nearly blew it. The next night, they allowed a go-ahead goal to the visiting New Jersey Devils just 46 seconds after defenseman John Carlson tied the score,  . And they let a 2-0 lead evaporate in   to the Carolina Hurricanes on Friday at Capital One Arena. “Just game-flow-wise, similar to the last game,” Carlson said Friday night. “That’s what makes it frustrating. Not only did we talk about it and go over it and make a point about it, it happened again. … Whether we’ve got our A stuff and we’re dominating or we’re playing okay or we’re playing terrible, we’ve got to find a way to garner momentum. It seems like we just come up short every time on those big plays. … It’s made every game a grind right until the end, even when we’re playing decent and winning games. We’ve got to find that whatever you want to call it — killer instinct.” Coach Spencer Carbery expressed as much frustration with his team Friday as he has shown at any point this season, emphatically stating the Capitals have “a lot of growing to do.” Every skater but defenseman Rasmus Sandin, who is out with an illness, and captain Alex Ovechkin, who took a maintenance day after an awkward collision late in Friday’s loss, was on the ice at least 15 minutes before practice officially began Saturday, working with the assistant coaches. Practice itself was spirited, with a heavy dose of battle drills aimed at getting Washington back on track. “We just have to get better,” Carbery said Saturday. “… Not only collectively as a team inside of our structure but individually, we’ve got to get better and we’ve got to work to get to those spots. We can’t just say it and just snap your fingers and think that all of a sudden your game’s going to get to a good spot. We’ve got to get to work.” With 10 games remaining until the all-star break, the next several weeks have the makings of a make-or-break stretch for the Capitals (18-13-6). A Sunday afternoon matchup with the visiting Los Angeles Kings —   — is followed by a Thursday game against the Seattle Kraken, which hasn’t lost in regulation in 10 games (8-0-2), and then a back-to-back next weekend with the New York Rangers, who handed the Capitals  . “These are all games where you’re getting tested against the elite teams in the league,” Carbery said. “At the end of the month, we’ll know a lot about our group and where we stand and where we go from there.” The way Washington has played since the break suggests this stretch is more likely to break its playoff hopes than make them. Washington entered Saturday just two points out of the second wild-card spot in the East, but it had fallen to seventh in the Metropolitan Division. The Capitals’ defense and goaltending, which kept them above water earlier in the season, have slipped, and the offense hasn’t produced nearly enough to overcome anything less than elite play on the other end of the ice. Goaltender Charlie Lindgren’s upper-body injury hasn’t helped, but the underlying numbers indicate Washington was due for a few results similar to what it has posted over the past six games. “I look at it through the process of what we’re doing,” Carbery said. “We’ve got to get a lot better at managing the puck. We’ve got to get a lot better at being able to create some things off the forecheck, sustain some pressure [offensive zone]-wise, pucks to the interior, being able to exit our zone consistently, which I thought we did a good job of for the most part [Friday] night. Then we’ll have two or three or four hiccups that are really big mistakes in those moments. “There’s a lot of areas of our five-on-five game that we’ve got to get right, and we’re being pushed to the limit by really quality teams right now.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAIN34RCMZXW3244A3NC4IWK7A_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAIN34RCMZXW3244A3NC4IWK7A_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAIN34RCMZXW3244A3NC4IWK7A_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAIN34RCMZXW3244A3NC4IWK7A_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAIN34RCMZXW3244A3NC4IWK7A_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RAIN34RCMZXW3244A3NC4IWK7A_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/capitals-losing-streak/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 18:05:00,

Despite all the uncertainty that comes with betting college football’s postseason these days, I managed to wrangle an 8-6 record with these picks during bowl season, hitting   for the College Football Playoff semifinals. I’m 38-28 for the season, which I will gladly take. Let’s end strong with a couple of bets on Monday night’s CFP championship game between Michigan and Washington. All times Eastern. All spreads and totals taken Monday morning from DraftKings Sportsbook.  in the Rose Bowl may have been close on the scoreboard, but it wasn’t such a ballgame when you dive into the box score. The Wolverines averaged 1.5 yards per play more than the Crimson Tide, a sizable number in a one-game sample size. Take away Alabama’s eight-play touchdown drive that spanned the third and fourth quarters, one in which it averaged 6.9 yards per play, and the Crimson Tide averaged only four yards per play for the game. Alabama fumbled the ball five times but lost only one of them, which is extreme good luck. The Wolverines also were fortunate in that regard, losing only one of three fumbles, but Alabama converted its one recovery (Semaj Morgan’s first-quarter muffed punt) into a short touchdown drive. What I’m trying to say is the Michigan-Alabama game was deceptively close, the point spread for the CFP championship would be larger had the scoreboard reflected the Wolverines’ superiority, and the Wolverines are simply a better all-around team than Washington. Huskies quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and his trio of elite wide receivers  , with Penix averaging 11 yards per attempt and throwing two touchdown passes. But as one anonymous coach who has faced either Michigan or Washington   last week, “Michigan’s defense is basically just Texas with better [defensive backs].” The Huskies lead the nation in passing plays of at least 10 yards (189) and rank second behind LSU in passing plays of at least 20 yards (77), but it’s going to be more difficult for them to gain chunks of yardage through the air against the Wolverines than it was against the Longhorns. Michigan has given up only 79 passing plays of at least 10 yards (No. 6 nationally) and only 23 of at least 20 yards (No. 3). Texas ranks No. 116 and No. 108, respectively, in those categories. On offense, the Wolverines run the ball an almost excessive amount: 59.1 percent of the time, which ranks No. 17 in the nation. And that seems unlikely to change against a Washington defense that ranks   and   (4.4). Texas averaged 6.43 yards per carry against the Huskies, Washington’s second-worst performance in that statistic all season, but the Longhorns decided to more or less abandon the run after three quarters: In the fourth, they ran the ball only six times — compared with 23 pass attempts — as they struggled to dig out of a 13-point deficit. Michigan will lean on running backs Blake Corum and Donovan Edwards early and often to stay on schedule, not only because they should be able to move the ball but also because it’ll keep Penix and those receivers off the field. Favorites in the CFP championship game have covered the spread in the past four seasons, all by at least 12 points. And while asking Michigan to beat Washington by double digits might be a tough ask, I think the Wolverines can lean on the Huskies enough to cover this number, with Corum having a big night.

"MELBOURNE, Australia — Displays of Nazi salutes and symbols were banned in Australia starting Monday, with lawbreakers facing 12 months’ imprisonment. The ban will “ensure no one in Australia will be allowed to glorify or profit from acts and symbols that celebrate the Nazis and their evil ideology,” Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said in a   Monday. MELBOURNE, Australia — Displays of Nazi salutes and symbols were banned in Australia starting Monday, with lawbreakers facing 12 months’ imprisonment. The ban will “ensure no one in Australia will be allowed to glorify or profit from acts and symbols that celebrate the Nazis and their evil ideology,” Attorney General Mark Dreyfus said in a   Monday. Displays of Nazism are legally restricted in   a dozen countries, particularly within Europe, according to Yad Vashem, a Holocaust remembrance center. However, in the United States, a   upheld the National Socialist Party of America’s right to demonstrate while displaying Nazi symbols under the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech. The Australian bill was introduced in June by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s center-left government, after incidents where Nazi salutes were used. These included a   for transgender people in March and an   in May, both outside the Victoria state parliament house in Melbourne. In a discussion of the legislation on podcast The Briefing in November, Dreyfus   there had been “unthinkable, disturbing and appalling displays of antisemitic hatred and violence and symbols in our communities” over the past year. “And in recent weeks, I’m sad to say, we’ve seen a heightening of that kind of unacceptable behavior,” he said. The internet and covid-19 lockdowns, which were especially strict in Melbourne, where the main protests took place, were factors in a rise in right-wing extremism, according to a 2022 Australian Parliamentary Library   to lawmakers on the issue. The Executive Council of Australian Jewry   there was more than a sevenfold increase in the number of reported antisemitic incidents in October and November 2023, right after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the subsequent Israel-Hamas war, when compared to the same period in 2022. There was a 13-fold spike in anti-Muslim incidents over a similar period,   to the Islamophobia Register Australia. “It ought to be a matter of pride in our country, which is one of the most multicultural countries in the world, that everybody is free to practice their faith, everybody is free to live in our country without fear of discrimination,” Dreyfus said in the November interview. The federal   bans public displays of the Nazi salute and Nazi symbols including the Hakenkreuz, more commonly referred to as the swastika; the double-sig rune, associated with the SS; and symbols used by terrorist organizations. It also forbids trading in material that shows prohibited symbols. It makes a federal crime of what was already illegal in varying degrees under state law in   of Australia, with exceptions for legitimate religious, academic, educational, artistic, literary or scientific purposes and media coverage.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OS4DNE3CXUTO66LEULMGHQR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OS4DNE3CXUTO66LEULMGHQR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OS4DNE3CXUTO66LEULMGHQR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OS4DNE3CXUTO66LEULMGHQR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OS4DNE3CXUTO66LEULMGHQR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2OS4DNE3CXUTO66LEULMGHQR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/09/australia-bans-nazi-salutes-swastikas/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 05:40:00,
"The South River girls have 11 active players. All of them suited up and played in a seven-point win over Meade on Friday that left the Seahawks 8-1. Coach Mike Zivic ideally would have played only four of them. The Seahawks are shorthanded and have been for most of the season. They’re missing four players — including three who have been out the entire season — because of ACL tears. Each would have either started or played extended bench minutes. The South River girls have 11 active players. All of them suited up and played in a seven-point win over Meade on Friday that left the Seahawks 8-1. Coach Mike Zivic ideally would have played only four of them. The Seahawks are shorthanded and have been for most of the season. They’re missing four players — including three who have been out the entire season — because of ACL tears. Each would have either started or played extended bench minutes. “I know a lot of them are very passionate about this game, and it’s a pretty big part of their life, so it’s just really heartbreaking to see them,” junior guard Adella Norton said. They lost Raegan Ogle first, before last season’s playoffs, in an extra scrimmage Zivic scheduled to keep his team in shape amid an extended break between games. South River beat Broadneck in its first playoff game but scored just 23 points in a season-ending loss to Severna Park. Samie Clark and Kiera West, last season’s second-leading scorer and first player off the bench, respectively, tore their ACLs during offseason AAU contests. Zivic told his players before this season he still believed they were good enough to win the Anne Arundel County championship and compete at the state level. The Seahawks met his challenge by winning their first seven games. But then Ryleigh Adams, who Zivic said was his best player to start the season and averaged 14 points and eight rebounds per game, tore an all-too-familiar ligament during the Seahawks’ last Christmas tournament game against Hayfield — their lone loss. Unfazed, Zivic gathered his players two days into 2024 and told them his lofty expectations remained. That demanded multiple individual improvements. For example, Norton was asked to be smart on the court and subsequently drew a pair of charges in the win over Meade. In more good news for the Seahawks, Ogle is expected to return sometime this season. Until then and beyond, South River will continue persisting. “We all need to step up each time we get out on the court, whether it’s at practice or at games, individually and as a whole team,” Norton said. “And just stay positive, keep encouraging each other and keep growing as a team.” Carlton Young is used to relocating, moving as far as Singapore internationally and all around domestically, so when he finally settled back in Arlington for the first time in a decade, he searched for memories of his last time in the city — and a new basketball team. The only mental image that came to mind was that of his second-grade best friend, Miles Hancock. And so when he visited Wakefield this past summer and saw Hancock on the floor, he figured he probably had found his team. More time around Wakefield and — more broadly — a family-like atmosphere that Young and his mom noticed under Coach Tony Bentley led Young to pick Wakefield over private school power Bishop O’Connell. At Wakefield, he saw an opportunity to lift his teammates. “We bonded really quickly. I trust my teammates through thick and thin,” Young said. “Now everybody is part of that family culture.” Behind Young (23.1 points and 10.1 rebounds per game on 63 percent shooting) and a rejuvenated culture, the Warriors are 10-2 following two ho-hum seasons. The team last reached the state final in 2018. “We got back to the old family way,” Bentley said, denoting a trip to Charlotte and a preseason banquet with team parents as catalysts to camaraderie. “Parents are hugging and high-fiving at games. The guys are leaning on each other.” Bentley remains regularly surprised by Young’s character on and off the court. He certainly didn’t expect a 6-foot-4, 230-pound player to move as if he was a guard, to be so humble and easygoing in his daily approach, to have the biggest smile on the team or to have the extroversion and care to pop into Bentley’s classes most school days. “He’s so unselfish, to the point where I thought he was doing it to be accepted among the other guys,” Bentley said. “I had to explain to him, ‘Son, you’re different.’ ” He said it’s a testament to Young’s mom, who, after the senior’s 25-point season debut, told her son he “left a bunch of points on the board.” “When I met Carlton, I was like: Holy s---. He’s a once-in-a-generation type of player here at Wakefield,’ ” Bentley said. “And he’s an even better person.” The sophomore guard broke a single-game program record with 45 points in the Mustangs’ win over The Heights on Thursday. His sister, Qandace, was named player of the week  after leading her team to a tournament championship. The sophomore guard had 30 points and nine rebounds in a win over No. 19 Gainesville as her Yellow Jackets continue to play beyond their experience level. The Bulldogs rallied from a 12-point deficit to beat Glen Burnie, 70-69, in double overtime in large part because of the junior guard’s team-high 31 points.  Teammate Brian Griffin, a senior point guard, chipped in 27 points and five steals. The senior tallied 29 points and 16 rebounds to lead the Clippers past previously unbeaten Largo, 65-50. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. Friday, 5:30 p.m. Friday, 5:45 Wednesday, 5:30 Last March, when her team won the D.C. State Athletic Association A division title, Archbishop Carroll Coach Edythe White called it a “program-defining win.” “We’ve been knocking on that door for a while,” White   “Today, we finally broke it down.” This winter, the Lions have stayed firmly within that room of success. Carrying the momentum of that title, the program’s first since 1998, they have begun this season 11-1. A strong start has evolved into something more impressive as the Lions kicked off the new year with a double-digit win over Washington Catholic Athletic Conference powerhouse St. John’s. White, who has coached Carroll since 2009, estimated it was the program’s first win over the Cadets in more than 15 years. “Knowing how we ended last year and looking at what we brought in, I thought we could be good,” White said. “I didn’t know we could start the year with one loss, but I definitely felt good about the direction the program was moving in.” The Lions’ resurgence is part of a marked shift in the WCAC; the talent-rich league has looked top-heavy in recent years. St. John’s, Paul VI and McNamara have taken turns making dominant runs and boxing out the league’s middle class. This winter, programs such as Carroll, Elizabeth Seton and Bishop Ireton have fared well in the early part of the campaign and look to be real threats. “You’re so used to that dynamic with the top three,” White said. “And those are fantastic programs. … But we’ve got great coaches setting up at some of these other schools, and they’re starting to get the players they need to try and turn the tables. Everybody wants to put their program on the map.” Wise’s boys pride themselves on playing fast. Whether it’s through sprinting up the floor in transition or hurrying opponents into quick turnovers, the Pumas rely on speed as the foundation of their playing style. “When we’re on the floor, we want to go 110 percent,” senior guard Marcus Rustin said. That speed has catalyzed a strong start for Wise, which sits at 5-2 and has won each of its first four county games. The Pumas knocked off Richard Montgomery in a high-scoring 87-81 win to close out 2023 before starting the new year with a 77-68 victory over Eleanor Roosevelt. Still, Coach Lou Wilson said his team has yet to find its top form. The Pumas have let multiple comfortable victories turn into close games by, in Wilson’s eyes, playing “too fast” in specific moments. “You need to play smarter and set a different pace when you’re up by 10 points with a minute to go in the game,” Wilson said. The Pumas have several months to work on perfecting their pace as they race toward another postseason run. Wilson said he plans on implementing situational drills in practice moving forward to give players a better understanding of when to best show off their speed. When the Pumas figure that out, Wilson said, they believe they will be a tough out. “We feel like we haven’t really scratched the surface as to how good we can be in February,” Wilson said. “But I’m happy with the start of the season.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSGSN7CFWZE2HMK5QT2JJYBYNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSGSN7CFWZE2HMK5QT2JJYBYNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSGSN7CFWZE2HMK5QT2JJYBYNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSGSN7CFWZE2HMK5QT2JJYBYNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSGSN7CFWZE2HMK5QT2JJYBYNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSGSN7CFWZE2HMK5QT2JJYBYNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/south-river-keeps-winning-despite-acl-tears-forward-finds-home-wakefield/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 14:47:00,

Houston   Ryans, a former Texans player who most recently had been the defensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers, in January 2023. He was the only Black coach hired during the leaguewide hiring cycle for head coaches. And he should receive plenty of votes in coach of the year balloting. The Texans used the No. 2 choice in the draft on Stroud after the Carolina Panthers took fellow quarterback Bryce Young first. The Texans, at least so far, are the big winners there. Stroud immediately established himself as a franchise quarterback and will vie with Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua for offensive rookie of the year honors. Stroud threw two touchdown passes Saturday, including a 75-yard strike to wide receiver Nico Collins on the Texans’ first offensive play, as part of a 20-for-26, 264-yard performance. “Everybody counted us out from the start,” Stroud said as he became emotional during his postgame TV interview. “So, man, it’s just special to see the city of Houston on the come-up again.” Tailback Devin Singletary’s three-yard touchdown run with 6:20 remaining broke a 17-17 tie, but the Texans missed the extra point. The Colts drove toward a potential go-ahead score but failed on fourth and one at the Houston 15-yard line with 1:03 left when wide-open running back Tyler Goodson dropped a slightly off-target pass from Gardner Minshew II. The Texans took possession and surrendered a safety with a second left before closing out the win. Tyler Goodson can't bring in this fourth down pass from Gardner Minshew.  Texans take over.  The Colts were eliminated from playoff contention. Even so, they went 9-8 and were among the league’s success stories. They went 4-12-1 last season and were derided when owner Jim Irsay hired former Colts center Jeff Saturday as interim coach to replace the fired Frank Reich despite Saturday’s lack of coaching experience above the high school level. The Colts dealt with a contract dispute with standout tailback Jonathan Taylor and lost rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson, taken fourth in the draft, to season-ending shoulder surgery. But Shane Steichen provided a steady hand in his rookie season as an NFL head coach and Minshew kept the Colts in playoff contention until the final week of the regular season. Taylor provided a 49-yard touchdown run Saturday night as part of a 30-carry, 188-yard rushing performance. He returned to the game in the fourth quarter after exiting temporarily with what the Colts first called a heel injury, then reclassified as an ankle injury. He was on the sideline for the decisive fourth-and-one play.  They beat the Ravens, 17-10, on a soggy, windy, dreary Saturday in Baltimore to keep their playoff chances alive. But if they do reach the postseason, the Steelers may have to play without star pass rusher T.J. Watt, who exited with an injury to his left knee. Watt, who leads the NFL with 19 sacks and is a defensive player of the year candidate, reportedly suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament and lobbied to return to Saturday’s game, but the Steelers would not allow it. Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin said only that Watt was being evaluated for a knee injury and more information would be available in the coming days. “Obviously disappointed in that,” Tomlin said during his postgame news conference. “But there are challenges in the game of football. There are challenges in life. And so we’ll deal with it, whatever it may be.” T.J. Watt is headed to the Steelers locker room.  The Steelers completed a season sweep of the Ravens, who rested quarterback Lamar Jackson and other key starters Saturday with the AFC’s No. 1 seed already clinched, and improved to 10-7. They won their final three games, all with Mason Rudolph starting at quarterback. They still have not had a losing season in Tomlin’s 17-year coaching tenure. “We’re really focused on what we needed to do today,” Tomlin said. “There’s a sense of accomplishment regarding that. And so we’ll see about all that other stuff.” The Steelers will secure an AFC wild-card spot with a loss Sunday by the Jaguars or the Buffalo Bills. With that   win, here's how they can secure a spot in the  . ⬇️  Rudolph’s success justified Tomlin’s decision to stick with the former third-stringer as the starter this week. He threw a 71-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Diontae Johnson to break a 7-7 tie in the opening minute of the fourth quarter. Tailback Najee Harris ran for 112 yards and a touchdown. “We’re complementing each other well right now,” Rudolph said. “We’re running the ball extremely well. You have to do that in conditions like this. ... The defense got huge stops. I just think we’re kind of hitting our rhythm here late in the season.” When December began, the Philadelphia Eagles very much   that was headed back to the Super Bowl. They had an NFL-best record of 10-1. They had just beaten the Dallas Cowboys, Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills in consecutive games. They had the San Francisco 49ers coming to Philadelphia for the rematch of last season’s NFC championship game, giving the Eagles a chance to reaffirm their conference supremacy and take another step toward possibly securing the Super Bowl title that barely eluded them last February. No other NFL team had fewer than three losses at that point. That seems like such a long time ago. It is only a little over a month later, but   Eagles most decidedly are not   Eagles. Their season has unraveled. The Eagles were   in that Dec. 3 game at Lincoln Financial Field. They lost the game decisively, and they lost their composure when their chief security officer, Dom DiSandro, was   with 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw, leading the NFL to ban DiSandro   for the rest of the regular season. He can return to the sideline during the postseason. Quarterback Jalen Hurts speaks with the media.    And the Eagles have kept losing. The defeat to the 49ers began a 1-4 stretch that dropped Philadelphia not only out of the NFC’s No. 1 seed but out of first place in the NFC East. The Cowboys have taken over the division lead and can clinch the title with a victory over the Washington Commanders on Sunday at FedEx Field. The Eagles, to overtake the Cowboys, must beat the New York Giants on the road and root for a Commanders triumph. Coach Nick Sirianni turned over the defense last month to Matt Patricia, making the former Detroit Lions coach the defensive play-caller and de facto coordinator over Sean Desai, who still has the coordinator title but not the accompanying authority. It has not helped. If anything, the defensive results have been worse. The Eagles squandered a 21-6 lead and lost, 35-31, at home Sunday to the Arizona Cardinals. The Cardinals amassed 221 rushing yards and picked up only their fourth victory of the season for their first-year head coach, former Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon. The Eagles continue to express the belief that things can be fixed. “I think it’s as simple as taking ownership for the things that you can control,” quarterback Jalen Hurts said at a midweek news conference, “and committing to giving your best self and being your best self.” Head Coach Nick Sirianni with the media.    Sirianni said at his news conference the same day that “there’s no magic to this” while stressing the “daily, repetitive processes” that lead to everyday gains. “If we knew exactly what it was these last couple weeks, we would have done that,” Sirianni said. “It’s about going to work every single day and being locked into the details of the meeting and being locked into the walk-through and … having a high-intensity practice and to be committed to our core values.” Sirianni has acknowledged that he must do a better job projecting calm to his players than he did during a Christmas Day victory over the Giants in Philadelphia, saying he was “too tense” that day. Wideout A.J. Brown — who has topped 100 receiving yards only once in the past eight games after six straight with more than 125 — told reporters this week that he had no issues with Sirianni or the offensive play-calling. The comments came after Brown’s on-field displays of frustration became a topic of public scrutiny and conversation. Tensions are running high indeed. The Eagles’ reduced chances of winning the NFC East raised the possibility that Sirianni could sit Hurts and other key starters Sunday. But the Eagles still can win the division and, even if they don’t, those players might need to be on the field to get things headed back in a positive direction. They are attempting to become only the fourth team to win the Super Bowl a season after  . Even with their downward spiral, the Eagles insist that still could happen. “I’ve got the same hunger,” Hurts said. “Maybe a different hunger to achieve what’s in front of us.” A calamitous season for the New York Jets will come to a merciful close with Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots in Foxborough, Mass. The question now is whether next season will be any better. Jets owner Woody Johnson has said he will retain Robert Saleh as coach and Joe Douglas as general manager. Johnson made that declaration before the Jets’ pitiable first-half performance in their Week 17 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Saleh and Douglas were fortunate in that regard. But Johnson had little choice, given that quarterback Aaron Rodgers already had endorsed the current decision-making regime. Rodgers undoubtedly wants to see offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett retained as well. The competitive portion of the Jets’ season essentially ended  , when Rodgers suffered a torn Achilles’ tendon in his left leg. He kept talking about returning to play late this season, but the Jets’ inability to remain in the playoff race made such discussion moot. Rodgers will turn 41 next season. He has not played at an elite level since the 2021 season, when he   with the Green Bay Packers. He was only the NFL’s 16th-rated passer last year with the Packers. It remains to be seen whether he can return to being a top-tier quarterback, at his age and coming off his injury. The Jets will have a few good pieces around him on offense next season, in wide receiver Garrett Wilson and tailback Breece Hall. But they need more playmakers, and the offensive line is a major issue. Meanwhile, the Jets like to say they have a championship-caliber defense. Indeed, they are ranked fifth in the NFL in total defense this season. But will that defense maintain its level next season, particularly if the offense does not improve as much as the Jets hope? The Jets and their fans again will have high hopes with Rodgers back on the field. But there are no guarantees that things will go as planned in 2024. They certainly didn’t this year.  The Baltimore Ravens have  . The 49ers locked up the NFC’s No. 1 seed. But plenty remains undecided entering the Week 18 games. Four division titles are unsettled. Five playoff spots remain up for grabs, and 20 teams remain in postseason contention. The Bills and Miami Dolphins will play Sunday night in Miami Gardens, Fla., for the AFC East title and the No. 2 seed in the AFC. But the Bills have not even clinched a playoff spot yet. Those teams with their postseason slots secured have the luxury of resting key starters, including their quarterbacks. Lamar Jackson sat out the Ravens’ 17-10 loss to the visiting Steelers on Saturday. Brock Purdy is being rested for the 49ers’ game Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams in Santa Clara, Calif. With the Rams also sitting Matthew Stafford, that game features a quarterback matchup of the 49ers’ Sam Darnold against the Rams’ Carson Wentz. The Browns are resting Joe Flacco and using Jeff Driskel — their fifth starting quarterback of the season — Sunday at Cincinnati. They’re locked into the AFC’s fifth seed. ""Year of the backup QB""? Believe it or not, we had MORE   quarterbacks start last season.  counts 66 different QB projected to start in 2023. We had 68 in 2022. And while there’s nothing at stake for the Jets-Patriots game in Foxborough, Bill Belichick’s uncertain status raises the possibility that it   for New England’s six-time Super Bowl-winning coach. Some within the league are convinced that Belichick and Patriots owner Robert Kraft will part ways. Others wonder whether Belichick could stay, with changes to the front office and coaching staff. A resolution to Belichick’s status won’t necessarily come quickly, since Kraft could want draft-pick compensation from another team interested in hiring Belichick in what would amount to a trade.  The NFL Players Association named Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, Dolphins offensive coordinator Frank Smith and Cowboys special teams coordinator John Fassel the best at their jobs, based on a survey of players released this week. The NFLPA announced only the top five for each position. Players were asked to rate their offensive, defensive & special teams coordinators this fall. We're publishing the top 5 to show the positive impact coaches can have & ensure players' voices are heard ahead of the hiring cycle. 🔗:    According to the survey, the 49ers’ Steve Wilks, the Cowboys’ Dan Quinn, the Minnesota Vikings’ Brian Flores and the Rams’ Raheem Morris ranked behind Glenn among defensive coordinators. The Carolina Panthers’ Thomas Brown, the Cowboys’ Brian Schottenheimer, the Bengals’ Brian Callahan and the Los Angeles Chargers’ Kellen Moore followed Smith among offensive coordinators. Chris Tabor, promoted   following the firing of Frank Reich, ranked second among special teams coordinators, followed by the Vikings’ Matt Daniels, the Lions’ Dave Fipp and the New Orleans Saints’ Darren Rizzi.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EVI7P7PQ5XKB5V325SVNGSCUM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EVI7P7PQ5XKB5V325SVNGSCUM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EVI7P7PQ5XKB5V325SVNGSCUM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EVI7P7PQ5XKB5V325SVNGSCUM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EVI7P7PQ5XKB5V325SVNGSCUM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3EVI7P7PQ5XKB5V325SVNGSCUM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/nfl-week-18-preview-philadelphia-eagles/,Washington Post,2024-01-07 00:39:00,
"It took just 90 seconds Saturday night for the New York Knicks to show who they are and, more specifically, who the Washington Wizards are not. It was right there as Isaiah Hartenstein collected a poor pass by the Wizards’ Tyus Jones and looked down at his palms; by the time his eyes went up, Jalen Brunson had zipped down the court ahead of the nearest Washington defender for an easy outlet and basket. It took just 90 seconds Saturday night for the New York Knicks to show who they are and, more specifically, who the Washington Wizards are not. It was right there as Isaiah Hartenstein collected a poor pass by the Wizards’ Tyus Jones and looked down at his palms; by the time his eyes went up, Jalen Brunson had zipped down the court ahead of the nearest Washington defender for an easy outlet and basket. The New York-leaning sellout crowd of 20,333 roared, celebrating the first — but far from the final — blow as every Knicks starter scored or assisted in the opening two minutes. Washington’s early eight-point deficit ballooned to 26 in the first half, and by game’s end, the rudderless Wizards were left with a 121-105 loss at Capital One Arena. In their fourth straight defeat, the Wizards again were cannon fodder for a playoff hopeful, falling to 1-19 against teams over .500. Only this time, they weren’t bludgeoned by one of the NBA’s superstars — those were absent from both rosters Saturday — but by a collection of scrappy, once-underappreciated players they could have had. “Even the best teams, not every night the ball is going to go in, and they excel in the other things and making the game close,” said the Wizards’ Deni Avdija, who had 23 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. “When the ball doesn’t go in, you’ve got to play better defense or be more aggressive and maybe crash the boards a little bit more — things that can help us get in a better flow.” Brunson (33 points) was available when Washington took Troy Brown Jr. 15th in the 2018 draft. (Brown now resides in Minnesota, averaging 4.7 points for the Timberwolves.) Hartenstein, whose eight points and 19 rebounds provided the type of rim protection that Washington sorely missed Saturday, cost the Knicks just $16 million over two years in 2022 free agency. Josh Hart (nine points, four rebounds),  , was available for scraps early in his career; his hometown team never bit. Julius Randle, who led all scorers with 39 points, was considered expendable until he got to New York. At the 2017 draft, Washington had traded away the 22nd pick. At No. 23, the Toronto Raptors scooped up two-way stalwart OG Anunoby (nine points, five rebounds),   in late December. It remains to be seen whether Washington (6-29), under its new brain trust steered by  , can hit on the same margins New York (21-15) did. But the Knicks’ success in constructing their roster and culture provided a look at what the Wizards could one day hope to become — especially with one controllable facet. “The defensive identity,” Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr. said of the Knicks’ central strength. “I think their roster composition plays to that strength in its totality. … They do everything with a certain level of aggression. And if you’re not ready to meet and exceed that, you’re going to be on your heels most of the night.” Washington struggled again in that department, allowing New York to shoot 49.4 percent. Unseld said his focus remains on developing strong defense in the team’s young core. “We try to do what they do [defensively],” said Kyle Kuzma, who led the Wizards with 27 points. “They just got the personnel to do it.” The Knicks’ barrage continued for most of the first half as the Wizards struggled with their opponents’ physicality. Randle had 13 points in the first quarter and 21 by halftime. Washington’s woes in the half were compounded by 14 turnovers and 3-for-15 shooting from outside. New York’s offense was active off the ball and on the glass, punctuated when Miles McBride flew toward the hoop for a putback dunk in the final moments of the opening quarter for a 15-point lead. Though Jones connected on a floater toward the end of the first half, providing a rare highlight for an otherwise static offense, it only cut the Wizards’ deficit to 20. “When you’re down 20, it’s never ideal. It’s taxing to claw your way back into a game,” said Unseld, who noted that both teams were on the second game of a back-to-back. “To show a little more resilience was positive, but we’ve got to make sure we’re ready to go at the start of the game.” Washington found life in the third quarter, generating better defensive results and forcing turnovers after switching to a zone, eventually trimming New York’s lead to five on Kuzma’s third three-pointer of the period. The shot capped a 26-11 run and forced a New York timeout. But the Wizards missed their next five outside shots to close the quarter, including an air ball by Avdija, which allowed New York to go on a 17-6 run and pull away for good. With five minutes left, following a Brunson three and a foul drawn by Randle, visiting fans showered the arena with a “Let’s go, Knicks!” chant.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5TWKQP2ZL4WQDKOMAK77QPF5I_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5TWKQP2ZL4WQDKOMAK77QPF5I_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5TWKQP2ZL4WQDKOMAK77QPF5I_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5TWKQP2ZL4WQDKOMAK77QPF5I_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5TWKQP2ZL4WQDKOMAK77QPF5I_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A5TWKQP2ZL4WQDKOMAK77QPF5I_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/wizards-knicks/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 22:47:00,
"With 72 seconds left and the score tied Sunday afternoon, with a faceoff coming in the Washington Capitals’ defensive zone, three players predictably came over the boards. Center Nic Dowd and wingers Nicolas Aube-Kubel and Beck Malenstyn, as they do for the majority of the Capitals’ defensive-zone faceoffs, took their positions and prepared to win the puck. With 72 seconds left and the score tied Sunday afternoon, with a faceoff coming in the Washington Capitals’ defensive zone, three players predictably came over the boards. Center Nic Dowd and wingers Nicolas Aube-Kubel and Beck Malenstyn, as they do for the majority of the Capitals’ defensive-zone faceoffs, took their positions and prepared to win the puck. Dowd won the draw against Los Angeles Kings winger Kevin Fiala, and the Capitals’ fourth-liners got to work doing what they do. Within seconds, they transitioned the puck out of the defensive zone, through the neutral zone and deep into the Kings’ end. Dowd found the puck in the corner and slipped it to Aube-Kubel at the top of the left circle, and he spotted Malenstyn with space in the slot. Malenstyn fed defenseman John Carlson at the right point, and he unleashed a slap shot. Carlson’s slapper sailed through the zone, perhaps deflecting off a Kings player in front of goalie Cam Talbot, and into the back of the net with just 52.9 seconds left. The Capitals beat the Kings, 4-3, at Capital One Arena to end a two-game skid in dramatic fashion after coming back from deficits of 2-1 and 3-2. “A great sequence at the end,” Coach Spencer Carbery said. “I love what Nic Dowd’s line does there, driving the puck down into the offensive zone and then just doesn’t settle to just hold it. There’s a couple plays to be made there, and they made them.” The game’s first five minutes bore a striking resemblance to the Capitals’ previous two games: Washington couldn’t get out of its own zone, and the Kings were firing pucks at goalie Darcy Kuemper (38 saves) nonstop. But after a nervy first few shifts, the Capitals (19-13-6) found their footing in a way they hadn’t since  . They didn’t find the back of the net — unlike their four-goal onslaught against the Penguins — but it was a stable, controlled start that fashioned a solid foundation. Dowd built on that 4:22 into the second period, sending a backhander on a two-on-one rush with Aube-Kubel past Talbot (30 saves) for the opening goal. That goal brought the duo’s first points of the day, but it wouldn’t be their last. The Kings (20-10-6) rapidly erased Washington’s momentum. Adrian Kempe tied the score at 7:12 with a one-timer on the power play, and Fiala made it 2-1 just under six minutes later. Los Angeles dominated the middle portion of the period, and it showed on the scoreboard. After center Evgeny Kuznetsov missed an assignment on Fiala’s goal, he didn’t play another shift in the period and skated just three in the third. The ensuing line changes — driven by what Carbery said, without naming Kuznetsov, was a sequence he “didn’t like” — put captain Alex Ovechkin with center Dylan Strome and winger Max Pacioretty. On the line’s first shift, Pacioretty stole the puck from the Kings as they attempted a breakout and fed Strome for a close-range two-on-zero rush with Ovechkin. Strome tapped the puck to Ovechkin, who sent it back to Strome for a finish into a wide-open net — tying the score at 2. “With the way things were going, Coach gives you an extra shift there, you try to get out there and take advantage of it,” Strome said. “[Pacioretty] made a great turnover, and when you play with a guy like O, he knows the offensive instincts of the game and gave me an open net. It was a great play.” That kind of response had been missing in recent games; Carbery said he was disappointed by his team’s lack of pushback  , and the Capitals wilted down the stretch   on Friday. Even when the Kings pulled ahead again 1:01 into the third period on a power-play tally by Fiala, Washington didn’t implode. The fourth line, which has six goals in the past five games, came through again to tie the score at 8:36. Aube-Kubel fired a wrist shot on the rush from the high slot that Talbot, who was screened by two of his own players, didn’t see coming. The fourth line’s mandate is to match up against the opponents’ top players. On Sunday, as the Capitals’ fourth line produced three goals, the Kings’ top players didn’t record a point at even strength. “They show up to the rink, and they know what they’re getting every single night,” Carlson said. “There’s no light at the end of the tunnel. There’s no ‘We’ll throw them a bone here or there.’ They’re grinding. Not just the goals — they wear a lot of teams down [with] the style that they play, the physicality that they bring. That’s important against great lines.” In the final minutes of regulation, as both teams pushed for a go-ahead goal, the energy inside Capital One Arena felt more like a Saturday night game against a Metropolitan Division rival than a Sunday matinee against a Western Conference team. And when Carlson’s winner found the net, the noise lasted until after the final horn sounded on a victory. “This was an important game for our group, and you could feel that at ice level,” Carbery said. “Sort of the way that you would script it for our group and the way things have gone the whole year and how we’ve found ways to win games. It was right on script.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLFTQH6KIOVWGWBQCOXPU34EGM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLFTQH6KIOVWGWBQCOXPU34EGM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLFTQH6KIOVWGWBQCOXPU34EGM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLFTQH6KIOVWGWBQCOXPU34EGM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLFTQH6KIOVWGWBQCOXPU34EGM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLFTQH6KIOVWGWBQCOXPU34EGM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/07/capitals-kings-fourth-line-comeback/,Washington Post,2024-01-07 20:11:00,
"HOUSTON — Apparently the honchos of college football intend to stage a national championship game Monday night with zero teams from the South. They seem hellbent on this sacrilege. How bold. Not since Ohio State and Oregon turned up at the first College Football Playoff title game in January 2015, and then were permitted to play it, has the South gone excluded on the closing, splashing Monday night. That game happened so long ago that both of its head coaches yak on TV nowadays, including one (Urban Meyer) who did TV, went to the NFL  , then returned to TV. HOUSTON — Apparently the honchos of college football intend to stage a national championship game Monday night with zero teams from the South. They seem hellbent on this sacrilege. How bold. Not since Ohio State and Oregon turned up at the first College Football Playoff title game in January 2015, and then were permitted to play it, has the South gone excluded on the closing, splashing Monday night. That game happened so long ago that both of its head coaches yak on TV nowadays, including one (Urban Meyer) who did TV, went to the NFL  , then returned to TV. Since that Ohio State-Oregon night in Arlington, Tex., 16 teams entering this season had reached championship games in greater Phoenix, Tampa, Atlanta, the San Francisco Bay Area, New Orleans, greater Miami, Indianapolis and greater Los Angeles. Six of those teams had the name “Alabama,” four had “Clemson,” three had “Georgia,” and one had “LSU.” That left a measly one slot apiece for Ohio State and TCU, the latter of Fort Worth, which some consider the South before being corrected. It also gave the South a certain healthy self-image that in turn spread irk across the land. Well, the sluggish roulette wheel of college football life finally made its way to Michigan (14-0) vs. Washington (14-0), who won their way all the way down here from the chillier air. “West Coast team, Midwest team, so it’s a little different for sure,” said Jaylen Harrell, a Michigan senior edge rusher and Tampa native who would have been 12 when Ohio State ravaged Oregon. “I think it’s great,” said Michigan graduate linebacker Michael Barrett from Valdosta, Ga. “I think it’s great,” said Michigan junior linebacker Junior Colson from Brentwood, Tenn. Elaborating, Barrett said, “You know, you get some versatility into the national championship, not always looking for an SEC team always to sneak in there, and it’s great for the Big Ten, great for the . . .” He paused there because the Pac-12 will disintegrate shortly because 10 teams fled it, including Washington toward the Big Ten, starting next season. Barrett continued: “. . . great for the Big Ten. I was going to say Pac-12! But, yeah, I feel like it’s great for the conference to have two teams that’s going to be in the Big Ten playing for the national championship. It’s great. I know all the people down south are kind of hating that.” Elaborating, Colson said: “You know, it’s allowing more teams now to start playing at that level, some teams started catching up. I think it’ll be great; it’s making football more competitive in a way. Most times it was just teams from the South — all those Clemsons, all those Alabamas, all those guys. So now, being able to add the Big Ten, the Pac-12, all those great teams that maybe didn’t get as much love, now they’re being put in the spotlight. It’s awesome.” In their shared interest in luring football players who can help fulfill the eternal civic wish of beating the snot out of teams from other cities and states, the Michigan and Washington rosters do feature Southerners and near-Southerners. Huskies receiver Ja’Lynn Polk, who has spent the season catching 65 passes for 1,122 yards and nine touchdowns, came from Lufkin, Tex., about 60 miles from Louisiana, so that either counts or almost counts. The Huskies’ great quarterback,  , hailed from wee Dade City, Fla. (population about 7,300, up Interstate 75 from Tampa), certainly the South, before he moved into Tampa in high school, then hopscotched through college into Bloomington, Ind., and Seattle. “To be honest, I’m still wrapping my head around it,” he said of this moment and this floodlit stage. Michigan has 33 players some could construe as coming from the South — 25 once one omits Texas and Northern Virginia — so the cheering from the South this time will come from scattered households. It marked a second straight year with a last matchup boasting freshness,  . That’s when Coach Sonny Dykes spoke of the transfer portal and the upcoming 12-team playoff, predicted more darlings up ahead and said, “I’ve always believed that the cream rises and the more opportunities that schools outside of the traditional brands get, the more those schools can become traditional brands.” Back in 2021, TCU went 5-7, Washington 4-8. So for now, there’s something afoot that looks something like variety and more than something like hope. “I think it says a lot about the parity of college football and how many teams could be in this spot,” Washington Coach Kalen DeBoer said. What it says about the SEC and the Pac-12 and everything in between, that will have to confine itself to this season given the demise of the latter, a circumstance of the   parity  . “If we’re looking at it from a standpoint of it’s good to have college football strong in all points of the country geographically, then that’s obviously a very positive thing for the sport,” said ESPN’s Rece Davis, an Alabama graduate and the gracious host of that longtime church of college football, “College GameDay.” “It’s exciting. They’ve got the huge brand name in Michigan and a really good one in Washington, and maybe the most fun team to watch all season has been Washington. You have a very appealing game. “If you’re looking at it from an evaluation-of-the-conferences standpoint, while I would still say the SEC was probably the best conference depending on how you evaluate this year, there was not the difference, and there was not the gap, in my judgment, that there has been in other years. And in fact, I said this season — and I still believe — that the Pac-12 had more contenders-slash-elite upper-middle class-type teams than any other conference. Maybe by the end, with the emergence of Missouri, maybe the SEC caught them, but for most of the year, the strongest upper-middle-class to elite teams were in the Pac-12. So because of that, I think it doesn’t feel lesser, if that’s what people think, because there’s not the Georgia, there’s not the Alabama, there’s not the Clemson. It feels like the two best teams are here, and so I think that’s great.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZZXK3JIU65NNQWQK4WHPSFYVQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZZXK3JIU65NNQWQK4WHPSFYVQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZZXK3JIU65NNQWQK4WHPSFYVQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZZXK3JIU65NNQWQK4WHPSFYVQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZZXK3JIU65NNQWQK4WHPSFYVQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZZXK3JIU65NNQWQK4WHPSFYVQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/cfp-championship-game-no-southern-teams/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 06:30:00,
"The final playoff spots were claimed and the postseason seedings fell into place on the last day of the NFL regular season. The top seeds in each conference already had been determined before Sunday’s play began. The Baltimore Ravens had clinched the AFC’s No. 1 seed. The San Francisco 49ers had secured the NFC’s top seed. They will have opening-round byes next weekend and home-field advantage through the conference championship games, if they advance that far. The final playoff spots were claimed and the postseason seedings fell into place on the last day of the NFL regular season. The top seeds in each conference already had been determined before Sunday’s play began. The Baltimore Ravens had clinched the AFC’s No. 1 seed. The San Francisco 49ers had secured the NFC’s top seed. They will have opening-round byes next weekend and home-field advantage through the conference championship games, if they advance that far. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Sunday to clinch the NFC South title. The Dallas Cowboys secured the NFC East crown and the conference’s No. 2 seed. The Jacksonville Jaguars failed in their bid to win the AFC South, handing the division title to the Houston Texans and clinching playoff spots for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Buffalo Bills. The Green Bay Packers reached the postseason as a wild-card entry in the NFC. The Bills beat the Miami Dolphins on Sunday night to win the AFC East, dropping the Dolphins into a wild-card spot.  The Bills resembled a championship team at times this season. Just as often, they looked nothing like that. But they are right back in the Super Bowl-contending mix. They won the AFC East for a fourth straight season and seized the No. 2 seed in the AFC by defeating the Dolphins, 21-14, Sunday night in Miami Gardens, Fla. The Bills will host the seventh-seeded Steelers next weekend in Orchard Park, N.Y. The Dolphins dropped to the No. 6 seed as a wild card and will travel to Kansas City to play the third-seeded Chiefs. “I think that’s a little bit of a microcosm of our season,” quarterback Josh Allen told NBC after the game. “Didn’t play our best ball early on. You know, wish I had a couple throws back early. … This team didn’t flinch. I’m so proud of how resilient this group is.” It's Steelers-Bills, Dolphins-Chiefs, Browns-Texans next weekend in the AFC's opening round.  It was a typically uneven performance Sunday night for Allen and the Bills. Allen committed three turnovers, throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble, but threw two touchdown passes. He threw for 359 yards and ran for 67 more. The Bills trailed, 14-7, in the fourth quarter. But they scored a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns on a 96-yard punt return by Deonte Harty and Allen’s five-yard pass to tight end Dawson Knox. The Bills ended the regular season on a five-game winning streak. “If you’d told me at the beginning of the year we’re 11-6, AFC East champs, [number] two seed, playing at home,” Allen said, “sign me up.” The Dolphins, playing without wide receiver Jaylen Waddle and running back Raheem Mostert, could not quite keep pace. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa had a touchdown pass to wideout Tyreek Hill but also threw two interceptions, including one to Bills safety Taylor Rapp with 1:13 to play to end the Dolphins’ final chance to craft a tying touchdown drive. The Dolphins lost their final two regular season games, to the Ravens and Bills. The Cowboys struggled just a bit in the game’s early going but then took control to beat the Washington Commanders handily, 38-10, Sunday at FedEx Field. They benefited from the Eagles’ late-season downward spiral to secure the No. 2 seed in the NFC. The Cowboys will host the Packers in an opening-round game next weekend, as Coach Mike McCarthy will face his former team. “The drama of it, I’m sure you guys will love,” McCarthy said Sunday evening. “I will not participate. … It’s playoff time. It doesn’t matter who we play, to be honest with you.” The Eagles lost in the same time slot late Sunday afternoon, so the Cowboys could have backed into the NFC East crown even with a listless performance against the Commanders. But they remained on a roll heading into the postseason. “That’s the way we wanted it,” McCarthy said. The Cowboys last won the division two years ago. They last reached the Super Bowl in the 1995 season. Last month, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones called the team’s failure to win a championship in the 2007 season, when it went 13-3 with Tony Romo at quarterback, his “biggest disappointment since I’ve been with the Cowboys.” He acknowledged then that this season represents the Cowboys’ best Super Bowl opportunity since. They have spent this season tantalizing their fans with the possibility of postseason glory. Too often in the past, they have failed to deliver on such promise. They have to hope things will be different this time based on the play of quarterback Dak Prescott, the exploits of wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and a sometimes-overpowering defense. The Cowboys are on a 16-game winning streak at home, and now are looking at the prospect of playing at AT&T Stadium through at least the divisional round of the postseason. “We’re at home,” star pass rusher Micah Parsons said in the Cowboys’ postgame locker room Sunday. “So I feel like we’re the team to beat right now.” The Buccaneers shut out the Carolina Panthers in Charlotte, 9-0, to secure their third straight division title. They finished 9-8, as the NFC South avoided the ignominy of having a division champ with a losing record for a second straight season. The Buccaneers will be the NFC’s No. 4 seed and will host the Eagles next weekend. Their victory eliminated the Atlanta Falcons from playoff contention. Falcons owner Arthur Blank must decide whether to retain Arthur Smith as the team’s coach after the third straight 7-10 season of Smith’s tenure. Smith left the field Sunday in New Orleans with an angry postgame tirade directed at Saints Coach Dennis Allen. Smith was upset with the Saints’ tactics late in a lopsided triumph for New Orleans. The Jaguars could have clinched the division title with a victory Sunday at Tennessee. Instead, they lost to the Titans, 28-20, and were eliminated from playoff contention. That completed a stunning late-season collapse for the Jaguars, who lost five of their final six games to finish 9-8. Sunday’s defeat was particularly excruciating. The Jaguars failed on a fourth-and-goal attempt from the Tennessee 1-yard line in the fourth quarter, trailing by eight points, when Trevor Lawrence extended the ball toward the goal line on a quarterback sneak but didn’t reach quite far enough. The Jaguars also failed on a fourth-and-two try from the Tennessee 33-yard line in the game’s final two minutes. The Jaguars’ defeat handed the AFC South title to the Texans. They will be the AFC’s No. 4 seed and will host the fifth-seeded Cleveland Browns next weekend. The Texans had clinched a playoff spot with their triumph Saturday night at Indianapolis in what amounted to a play-in game. The Colts were eliminated from playoff contention with their loss. The Jaguars’ loss also clinched a wild-card spot for the Steelers and a playoff berth for the Bills. The Steelers had kept their playoff hopes alive with Saturday’s victory at Baltimore, their third straight win with Mason Rudolph starting at quarterback. The Eagles will be a wild-card team and the No. 5 seed. The Los Angeles Rams are in as the No. 6 seed. The Packers beat the Chicago Bears, 17-9, Sunday at Lambeau Field to secure the final wild-card spot in the NFC as the No. 7 seed. They reached the playoffs in the first season with Jordan Love as their starter at quarterback after trading Aaron Rodgers, their four-time league MVP, to the New York Jets in the offseason. The Packers’ triumph eliminated the Seattle Seahawks and the Saints. The Browns are in as the No. 5 seed. The Steelers are in as the seventh seed. The Dolphins became the No. 6 seed with their loss Sunday night. The Ravens clinched the top seed in the AFC with their Week 17 triumph over the Dolphins and had quarterback Lamar Jackson, the MVP favorite, and other key starters sit out Saturday’s loss to the Steelers during a soggy finale in Baltimore. Coach John Harbaugh has said the team is mindful of its divisional-round playoff defeat to the Titans in the 2019 season, the previous time the Ravens were the No. 1 seed, and will try to apply the lessons learned from that. The Ravens are seeking their first Super Bowl title since the 2012 season. The defending Super Bowl champs were locked into the AFC’s third seed entering Week 18. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes sat Sunday’s regular season finale against the Los Angeles Chargers in Inglewood, Calif. Blaine Gabbert made the start at quarterback for the Chiefs. The Chiefs will host an opening-round game next weekend against the Dolphins and then, if they advance, could take to the road for their divisional-round game. If so, it would be Mahomes’s first AFC playoff game on the road. The Chiefs will need plenty of help if they’re going to host the AFC championship game for a sixth straight season. They have reached three Super Bowls and have won two of them during that run of prosperity. This has been, in relative terms, a season of struggles. Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce and Coach Andy Reid have shown their frustration. The deficiencies of the wide receiver group have been glaring. But maybe Reid and Mahomes can summon some of their usual magic for a surprising postseason push. They are the No. 5 seed in the AFC and will play at Houston next weekend. With their playoff spot in hand and that seeding locked in, Coach Kevin Stefanski rested quarterback Joe Flacco in Sunday’s game in Cincinnati to finish the regular season. Jeff Driskel became the fifth starting quarterback this season for the Browns following Deshaun Watson, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, PJ Walker and Flacco. Stefanski is a top contender for the coach of the year award. Flacco could be the comeback player of the year. With their dominant defense and an offense that has become functional behind Flacco, the Browns are dangerous entering the postseason. Flacco could face his former team, with the Browns potentially in line for a divisional-round meeting with the Ravens in Baltimore if they win their opening-round game next weekend in Houston and the seedings hold up otherwise. They won Saturday night in Indianapolis, in what amounted to a play-in game, to clinch a playoff spot. That became the AFC South title with the Jaguars’ loss Sunday. The Texans are in the postseason for the first time since the 2019 season. It has been a dramatic turnaround led by their first-year coach, DeMeco Ryans, and their rookie quarterback, C.J. Stroud. The 49ers had the NFC’s No. 1 seed in hand and sat quarterback Brock Purdy for Sunday’s finale against the Rams in Santa Clara, Calif. Sam Darnold got the start at quarterback. Tailback Christian McCaffrey was sidelined by a calf injury. The Lions won the NFC North for their first division title in 30 years. They are the NFC’s third seed and will host the Rams next weekend. But they still were in the running for the No. 2 seed Sunday before the Cowboys’ victory, and Lions Coach Dan Campbell played quarterback Jared Goff and other key starters in Sunday’s triumph over the Minnesota Vikings in Detroit. That had ramifications for the Lions, as rookie tight end Sam LaPorta left the game with a knee injury. The defending NFC champs already had clinched a playoff spot. But they lost to the New York Giants, 27-10, Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J., to finish the regular season on a 1-5 downward spiral since their 10-1 start. That late-season slide dropped the Eagles out of first place in the NFC East. They will be the NFC’s No. 5 seed, as a wild card, and will face the fourth-seeded Buccaneers in Tampa next weekend. The Eagles could have won the division Sunday if they’d beaten the Giants and the Cowboys had lost to the Commanders. But that didn’t come close to happening. And the Eagles watched quarterback Jalen Hurts suffer a finger injury and wide receiver A.J. Brown suffer a knee injury. They have come undone. They have struggled badly on defense, even after Coach Nick Sirianni handed play-calling duties to Matt Patricia and in effect demoted Sean Desai. Time is running out for the Eagles to address their issues. The Rams already had clinched a playoff spot and they will be the No. 6 seed in the NFC. Carson Wentz started at quarterback Sunday against the 49ers as Coach Sean McVay sat down Matthew Stafford. The Rams will play the third-seeded Lions in the opening round next weekend in a return to Detroit for Stafford.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHCUKWOXKPE7B5AN76JWJXO2E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHCUKWOXKPE7B5AN76JWJXO2E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHCUKWOXKPE7B5AN76JWJXO2E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHCUKWOXKPE7B5AN76JWJXO2E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHCUKWOXKPE7B5AN76JWJXO2E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UHCUKWOXKPE7B5AN76JWJXO2E4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/07/whats-decided-what-isnt-final-sunday-nfl-regular-season/,Washington Post,2024-01-07 23:57:00,

Under the deal’s framework, every Israeli hostage freed would initiate the release of three Palestinian prisoners. Outside the framework of the exchange deal, 24 foreign nationals — who do not hold Israeli citizenship — were freed. Before the deal, some hostages — including two Americans — were also released or rescued. The specific number of hostages who have died in captivity and the ages, genders and nationalities of those remaining in Gaza are unclear. Israel has estimated that the majority of those remaining have Israeli citizenship and are male. It’s unclear how many are members of the Israeli military. Two Americans —  , 4, and  , 49 — were released under the exchange deal. Fewer than 10 U.S. citizens are now held hostage, according to the White House. While Hamas is thought to hold most of the hostages, some are believed to be held by other militant groups, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad, whose fighters also took part in the Oct. 7 attack. Israel blames Hamas for the deaths of some hostages and said three were killed in its own operations; Hamas says Israeli strikes have killed some hostages. The Washington Post could not independently verify either side’s claims. Here is a list of the hostages released and what is known about those who remain. Israel and Hamas initially   that would pause hostilities to exchange captives. The deal, which began Nov. 24, was extended multiple times, allowing for the release of more hostages.

Israel includes hostages who were killed, with their bodies still held by Hamas, in its count. The majority of the remaining hostages are Israelis or dual nationals, and male. Roughly eight Americans remain in captivity in Gaza, according to John Kirby, spokesman for the White House National Security Council. The only children on Israel’s list of remaining hostages are Kfir Bibas, who was 9 months old when he was abducted, and his 4-year-old brother, Ariel. Israel has said it is assessing Hamas’s claims that the Bibas children and their mother, Shiri, were killed. Ten of the remaining hostages are foreign nationals, according to Israel.

"Robin Bosworth, a varsity basketball player at her Jewish high school, noticed that the team’s Thursday night game against Roosevelt High School-Early College Studies in Yonkers, N.Y., was “a somewhat hostile environment,” with the first half featuring a few more elbow jabs and trash talk than usual. But she and her teammates at the Leffell School, in Hartsdale, N.Y., chose to channel their opponents’ aggression, Bosworth wrote in   for the Lion’s Roar, Leffel’s student newspaper, on which Bosworth serves as co-editor in chief. Robin Bosworth, a varsity basketball player at her Jewish high school, noticed that the team’s Thursday night game against Roosevelt High School-Early College Studies in Yonkers, N.Y., was “a somewhat hostile environment,” with the first half featuring a few more elbow jabs and trash talk than usual. But she and her teammates at the Leffell School, in Hartsdale, N.Y., chose to channel their opponents’ aggression, Bosworth wrote in   for the Lion’s Roar, Leffel’s student newspaper, on which Bosworth serves as co-editor in chief. Then, in the second half, she wrote, things escalated. The Roosevelt players started shouting, “Free Palestine” as well as “antisemitic slurs and curses at us.” Four days later, Yonkers Public Schools  it had fired Roosevelt’s coach and dismissed one of its players from the team for what it called “painful and offensive comments.” The incident occurred nearly three months after Hamas’s attack on Israel killed at least 1,200 people, sparked a war in which more than 23,000 have been   in Gaza and led to   and   in the United States. “This cannot be who we are as New Yorkers,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D)   on X, formerly known as Twitter, in response to the basketball game. “No one should ever be subjected to antisemitism or any kind of hate.” The Lion’s Roar did not immediately respond Monday to a request from The Washington Post to interview Bosworth. Antisemitic incidents spiked in the United States in the two months after Hamas attacked Israel, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The number of attacks, vandalism and harassment more than quadrupled in that time when compared with the same two-month span in 2022. Federal officials have said they have also responded to   since the start of the war. Anti-Defamation League chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt called the number of attacks against Jews “relentless” and said they showed “no signs of diminishing.” “The lid to the sewers is off, and Jewish communities all across the country are being inundated with hate,” Greenblatt said in   last month. “Public officials and college leaders must turn down the temperature and take clear action to show this behavior is unacceptable to prevent more violence.” On Monday morning, Yonkers Public Schools interim superintendent Luis Rodriquez and Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano (D)   to Bosworth, her teammates and the Leffell School “for the painful and offensive comments made to their women’s basketball team.” “Collectively, we do not and will not tolerate hate speech of any kind from our students and community. The antisemitic rhetoric reportedly made against the student athletes of The Leffell School are abhorrent, inappropriate and not in line with the values we set forth for our young people,” they wrote in a statement. When Yonkers school administrators learned of the incident, they launched an investigation that included referees, coaches, students and school officials from Leffell. After reviewing videos of the game and interviewing witnesses, the school district fired the coach and dismissed a player, neither of whom has been publicly named.

"Ryan Leonard sealed the gold medal with a kiss to the crowd.

Ryan Leonard sealed the gold medal with a kiss to the crowd. The Washington Capitals prospect scored to put the United States ahead of Sweden by three goals with less than four minutes to play in the title game of the world junior championship, and as a player who thrives as an antagonist, he knew exactly what he was going to do to celebrate. Leonard, whom the Capitals selected with  in the 2023 draft, watched the puck cross the line, turned toward the crowd and whipped off his right glove, blowing a farewell kiss to the thousands of home fans in Gothenburg. Ryan Leonard kisses Gothenburg goodnight  “It was just the heat of the moment,” Leonard said Tuesday, grinning as he recalled the celebration. “We all were just dying to win the game. The whole game, it was just all yellow noise for them. It was good to kind of give it back to them.” Throughout the tournament for players under 20 years old, the forward’s in-your-face style made him a frequent target for the Americans’ opponents. Chris Peters, who covers prospects for FloHockey,   that other teams “just hated him.” Leonard finished with three goals and three assists in seven games, none bigger than the dagger he scored late in the gold medal game. “I think that’s always kind of just been me, playing [with] a little chip on my shoulder,” Leonard said. “There’s always going to be people that don’t appreciate the way you play on the other side, but I think it’s all a part of the game. Every team’s going to have one of those guys, and I’m lucky enough to be that guy.” While Leonard was a thorn in the side of every team the United States faced, fellow Capitals prospect Ryan Chesley had a subtler tournament but was no less impactful. At his second world juniors, Chesley was an alternate captain and played high-leverage minutes on the top defensive pair. A second-round pick in 2022, Chesley is less brash than Leonard, but his calm nature on the blue line played a major role for the United States, which won gold for the first time since 2021. “Anytime you get to throw on that USA jersey, it’s an incredible opportunity just to represent the country and wear those colors,” Chesley said. “And to be able to be named one of the captains is a huge privilege and big responsibility. I was truly grateful and humbled and just honored to have that opportunity and be able to help lead that team.” The Capitals kept a close eye on Chesley and Leonard while they were in Sweden. They’re the first Capitals prospects to win gold since Connor McMichael won with Canada in 2020, and Washington Coach Spencer Carbery watched their progress with keen interest — when he wasn’t rooting for Canada, which lost in the quarterfinals. “To have two prospects in our organization not just playing but being with Team USA and progressing through the tournament and doing so well, it was great to watch,” Carbery said. “Happy for both guys. Texted them both. You could see just on the celebrations and on their faces watching them post-gold medal — it was pretty neat to see for them and an incredible accomplishment that they’ll have for the rest of their lives to reflect back on. They should be really proud of that. That’s no joke, winning that tournament.” Chesley and Leonard are playing college hockey. Chesley is a sophomore at Minnesota; Leonard is a freshman at Boston College. The Capitals retain each player’s signing rights for four years after the draft, but both are expected to turn professional before that — possibly as soon as this spring, after their college seasons end. Neither is in a rush to make such a significant decision; Leonard quipped that his primary concern right now is Boston College’s game against Providence on Friday. But when the time comes, they’ll inject additional youth and talent into Washington’s organization — whether that’s in the NHL or with Hershey in the American Hockey League. And the experience they’ll bring from winning a gold medal at a major international tournament won’t hurt, either. “It can be very, very valuable,” Carbery said. “It’s not the be-all, end-all, but just to be in those situations — I always appreciate the one-and-done because it’s one game for all the marbles. It’s your ultimate Game 7, when you’re going through that tournament. … Those games give you valuable experience playing in situations and touching the puck and having shifts where your season or your tournament is on the line. “I think anytime you repeat that as much as you possibly can as a young player and as you get into being a pro, it’s a benefit.” It has been two steps forward, one step back for the Capitals on the injury front, and that trend continued Tuesday. Goaltender Charlie Lindgren was activated from injured reserve after missing five games with an upper-body injury suffered Dec. 29, and winger T.J. Oshie returned to practice after getting treatment for his upper-body injury in Minnesota last week. Both are expected to be able to play this week. Winger Sonny Milano practiced in a noncontact jersey, and Carbery said he could be cleared for contact as soon as Wednesday. But while Washington got good news on Lindgren, Oshie and Milano, winger Tom Wilson and defenseman Rasmus Sandin missed practice with upper-body injuries. Wilson, who broke his nose in a collision late in Sunday’s win, was “pretty sore” Tuesday but is expected to practice Wednesday ahead of Thursday’s game against Seattle. The Capitals did not disclose Sandin’s injury; the blue-liner is listed as day-to-day. Captain Alex Ovechkin took a maintenance day Tuesday for the second practice in a row. Ovechkin tangled with Carolina Hurricanes forward Jordan Staal late in Friday’s loss and didn’t practice Saturday but  . Carbery said the Capitals hope Ovechkin will practice Wednesday.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7AZKIZFDLUHX4CZ3RY6KJOR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7AZKIZFDLUHX4CZ3RY6KJOR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7AZKIZFDLUHX4CZ3RY6KJOR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7AZKIZFDLUHX4CZ3RY6KJOR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7AZKIZFDLUHX4CZ3RY6KJOR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J7AZKIZFDLUHX4CZ3RY6KJOR7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/09/ryan-leonard-ryan-chesley-world-juniors/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 18:07:00,

As a former Marine Officer, I approached the job with purpose,” Greg Pence said in a  . “After three terms, I’ve made the decision to not file for reelection.” Pence, who represents Indiana’s 6th Congressional District, said he would serve out the remainder of his term this year. His departure will mark the end of nearly a quarter-century of public service by the Pence family. Mike Pence served in Congress from 2001 to 2013, before serving one term as governor of Indiana and another term as Donald Trump’s vice president. He briefly announced his own presidential bid last June, but   after struggling to gain traction in the primary. Greg Pence was in the Senate public gallery with his brother’s wife and daughter at the time of the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, when a pro-Trump mob overran the complex seeking to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s electoral win. Another Indiana congressman, Rep. Larry Bucshon (R),   he also would not be seeking reelection in November and will retire after seven terms in Congress. So far, more than three dozen House members — 22 Democrats and 17 Republicans, including Pence — have announced they will not seek reelection in November, either because they are retiring or seeking other office. The vacancies are contributing to a competitive election-year fight to determine who will control the chamber next year. With 220 Republicans and 213 Democrats in the House, the GOP holds a slim majority that risks becoming even narrower in the short term: A special election   will determine who will fill the seat for former congressman George Santos (R-N.Y.), who was expelled from Congress last month. A May 21   will determine who will fill the seat for former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who retired last month.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/274SGZSA5UI63DDOSODL27GYEY.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/274SGZSA5UI63DDOSODL27GYEY.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/274SGZSA5UI63DDOSODL27GYEY.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/274SGZSA5UI63DDOSODL27GYEY.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/274SGZSA5UI63DDOSODL27GYEY.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/274SGZSA5UI63DDOSODL27GYEY.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/greg-pence-retires-congress/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 13:08:00,

"Here at the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Eastern outpost, also known as Capital One Arena, Monday night looked like a family reunion before the Wizards ultimately fell, 136-128. It gets to be a mouthful counting the connections between the Wizards and the Thunder, but let’s start at the top. Washington General Manager   in Oklahoma City until Monumental Basketball chief Michael Winger hired him in June, and Winger himself  in the front office. The Wizards’ vice presidents of pro and college personnel, two longtime Washington front-office members who predate Winger and Dawkins, were scouts in Oklahoma City. The Wizards’ director of player health, who also predates Winger and Dawkins, came from the Thunder. Veteran players Mike Muscala and Danilo Gallinari had stints with the Thunder. Here at the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Eastern outpost, also known as Capital One Arena, Monday night looked like a family reunion before the Wizards ultimately fell, 136-128. It gets to be a mouthful counting the connections between the Wizards and the Thunder, but let’s start at the top. Washington General Manager   in Oklahoma City until Monumental Basketball chief Michael Winger hired him in June, and Winger himself  in the front office. The Wizards’ vice presidents of pro and college personnel, two longtime Washington front-office members who predate Winger and Dawkins, were scouts in Oklahoma City. The Wizards’ director of player health, who also predates Winger and Dawkins, came from the Thunder. Veteran players Mike Muscala and Danilo Gallinari had stints with the Thunder. It was easy to see what Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr. (no known ties to Oklahoma City) meant when he said pregame, “You see snippets [in their organization] as far as how we’re trying to mirror things here.” From a front-office perspective, mirroring the Thunder is a lofty goal. Oklahoma City hoarded draft picks, yes, but it also nailed a trade for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, hit big in the 2022 draft with Chet Holmgren and pieced together a roster that has reached the top tier of the Western Conference ahead of schedule. It took, to simplify more than a decade of complex work, militant organizational buy-in, patience, impeccable talent evaluation and a friendly market, among many other elements. The result is a team that reflects the front office. Both are workmanlike but with flair. That on-court energy was where the “snippets” Unseld spoke of were most present Monday night. At ground zero of their rebuild, the Wizards don’t much resemble any other NBA organization yet despite the Oklahoma City ties. But Monday, Washington played with the Thunder’s hunger. The Wizards drove their shoulders into defenders and thrashed for rebounds. They hit 15 three-pointers and looked as if they had something to prove. “I thought it was pretty good,” Unseld said. “I thought we were ready to go, had the energy. I thought we played well enough, we cut down on some of those other marginal areas, and we’d be okay.” At the risk of oversimplifying, the Wizards (6-30) lost because Oklahoma City (24-11) is a more polished team. Washington exceeded expectations in all of its usual problem areas: The Wizards rebounded well, losing the battle of the boards just 40-38 — thanks in no small part to the visitors’ efficient shooting — had the same number of turnovers and hit one more three-pointer. But the Thunder got rolling early, hit five three-pointers in the first quarter and had Washington on its heels all game, especially in transition. Oklahoma City never led by double digits for long, but with its shooting, it didn’t need to. The Thunder shot 59.1 percent from the field and 50 percent from beyond the arc. “The shooting right now is through the roof,” Unseld said, noting the Thunder’s strengths before the game. “You’ve got seven guys shooting over 40 from three; they’re the number one three-point shooting team in the league. That helps, and it plays into Shai’s ability to attack one-on-one, play volume pick and roll, Chet’s ability to play off the bounce, space the floor. There’s a good balance of all of that.” The Wizards don’t have that spacing, nor do they have the Thunder’s offensive weapons — Gilgeous-Alexander had 32 points, Holmgren had 31, and Jalen Williams added 21 points and 10 assists. But Monday reaped a lively performance from former Michigan guard Jordan Poole, who saw his fellow young shooters across the court and rose to the challenge with a team-high 24 points, including four three-pointers. He had 15 points in the third quarter alone. “I just felt more involved,” Poole said, decked out in Wolverines gear in honor of the  national title game, of his third-quarter performance. “I was able to be on ball a little more, bring it up, kind of initiate some offense to get the defense off me. … Just opened up the floor a little bit for my teammates, but through that kind of being able to be aggressive.” Kyle Kuzma added 22 points and 15 rebounds, and Tyus Jones had 18 points and nine assists. Deni Avdija played with force on both ends en route to a 17-point performance, and Landry Shamet added 15 points off the bench. It all served as a reminder: If the Wizards are going to replicate parts of Oklahoma City’s organization in any way, their on-court disposition might be a good place to start.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJRS6H5DMJ76LGSRHCBLARX5S4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJRS6H5DMJ76LGSRHCBLARX5S4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJRS6H5DMJ76LGSRHCBLARX5S4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJRS6H5DMJ76LGSRHCBLARX5S4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJRS6H5DMJ76LGSRHCBLARX5S4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EJRS6H5DMJ76LGSRHCBLARX5S4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/wizards-thunder-shai-gilgeous-alexander/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 23:04:00,

Falcons Coach Arthur Smith was irate and Saints Coach Dennis Allen was apologetic Sunday after New Orleans scored a late touchdown out of the victory formation in its 48-17 home win over Atlanta. After returning an interception to the Falcons’ 1-yard line with 1 minute 13 seconds to go, the Saints set up in the formation, from which teams normally kneel on the ball to drain the clock with victory assured. Instead, New Orleans quarterback Jameis Winston handed the ball to running back Jamaal Williams, who plowed into the end zone. Moments later, once the game had ended, Smith strode to midfield to express his displeasure with Allen. Smith, whose Falcons fell to 7-10, could be heard on the CBS telecast using profanity to angrily make his point. Arthur Smith and Dennis Allen have a postgame chat 😳  “It got out of hand,” Smith subsequently told reporters about a game that was tied at 17 at halftime before New Orleans blew it open, “and you can do whatever you want. I just gave them my opinion about it.” “That’s not who we are. That’s not how we operate. We should have taken a knee, so I want to apologize to them,” Allen said at a postgame news conference. “We’ve got a good rivalry and it’s a heated rivalry, but there’s a way we go about doing our business, and I wasn’t happy about that.” Allen, a 51-year-old in his second season as the Saints’ coach, said his players had “asked me about getting Jamaal a touchdown at the end.” “I said I wanted to take a knee,” Allen continued. “We put victory [formation] out there, and the guys kind of wanted to get him a touchdown. They did that on their own, and that’s not acceptable.” Williams came into the game without a touchdown this season after scoring an NFL-leading 17 on the ground last season for the Detroit Lions. “I couldn’t go home without getting him one,” Saints guard Cesar Ruiz   of the players’ decision to go rogue on Williams’s behalf at the goal line. “Whatever heat that comes with that, put that on the [offensive] line.” Winston — a backup to Saints starter Derek Carr who only entered the game for that play —   bucking Allen’s wishes was “a collective decision.” Winston added (via  ) that he apologized to Allen.

Atlanta HC Arthur Smith cursing DA after the game as they met at midfield.  The Saints improved to 9-8 with the victory, but by the time they got in formation for that play, they and the Falcons knew they both had been eliminated from playoff contention. Each team needed not only a win Sunday but also a loss by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who instead defeated the Carolina Panthers to win the NFC South with a 9-8 record. Atlanta earned a 7-10 record for the third time in as many seasons with Smith as its coach. With division rivals also struggling to get above .500, the Falcons were well-positioned in early December to finish ahead of them, but losses to the Bucs and a Panthers squad that was 1-12 at the time damaged Atlanta’s chances and led to questions about Smith’s job security. Those questions were answered early Monday morning when the Falcons   Smith had been dismissed.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDO33ITPOOB5GJQXZB3ODQ2ZBU_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDO33ITPOOB5GJQXZB3ODQ2ZBU_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDO33ITPOOB5GJQXZB3ODQ2ZBU_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDO33ITPOOB5GJQXZB3ODQ2ZBU_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDO33ITPOOB5GJQXZB3ODQ2ZBU_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDO33ITPOOB5GJQXZB3ODQ2ZBU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/07/arthur-smith-dennis-allen-jamaal-williams/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 00:24:00,

A Washington Post review of exclusive visuals of the attack, medical records and interviews with witnesses and first responders reveals that one of the Palestinians killed, 17-year-old Obada Saed Abu Srour, was shot in the back by settlers, probably as he was running from gunfire. Israeli troops, meanwhile, did not forcefully intervene, despite their obligation under international and Israeli law to protect all residents of the West Bank, including Palestinians. Soldiers and police were photographed at the scene of the deaths only after the attack ended, even though troops stationed at nearby military outposts were within earshot of the gunfire and had views of an earlier attack by settlers, the visual evidence shows. Abu Srour, the eldest of four children, with aspirations to become a policeman after finishing high school, was killed along with civil engineer and new father Muath Raed Odeh, 29.

Between Oct. 7 and Jan. 4,   Palestinians were killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops or settlers, a dramatic increase in the rate of killing in the last months of 2023, the deadliest year since the United Nations began recording casualties in 2005. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told The Post the incident is “under review” and the police have opened an investigation. Israeli Border Police said the incident is under “active investigation.” Abu Srour’s mother, Aya, remembers warning him on that fateful day. “He said he wanted to go help. I told him there was no need,” she said. “He said, ‘If I die, I die — I would be martyred.’” By the time Aya went back to check on her son, he was gone. A shot fired by Palestinians toward Esh Kodesh around noon on Oct. 11 started the deadly chain of events, a message in a WhatsApp group run by settlers claimed the next day. About 1 p.m., a group of masked settlers carrying firearms made their way into Qusra on all-terrain vehicles, according to Fouad Yasif Hassan, a Qusra resident and Red Crescent volunteer who was among the first to respond to the attack. Hassan told The Post that the settlers intentionally collided with a car in the area and began shooting at it. More than a dozen Palestinians fled north to take cover behind a large building, away from gunfire that appeared to be coming from the direction of Esh Kodesh toward Qusra. According to Hassan and local media reports, the masked settlers were firing mostly pistols and one M16, a popular military rifle. They left about 1:30 p.m. after shooting at several residents. Hassan said the Border Police and the army were in the area and cautioned residents not to attempt to stop the settlers. Only the police, Israeli officials told the village’s residents, were allowed to confront the settlers. Israeli soldiers stationed at two military outposts that sit between the settlement and the village would have had clear views of the road on which residents were fleeing and the building they hid behind, visual evidence shows. 2 Building used for shelter Israeli military  outposts 1 450 FEET Satellite © Planet Labs 2023 THE WASHINGTON POST 450 FEET 2 Building used for shelter Israeli military  outposts 1 THE WASHINGTON POST Satellite © Planet Labs 2023 An Israeli official with knowledge of the Oct. 11 incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak publicly, said soldiers heard sounds of gunfire coming from the village and left the outpost. He said soldiers reported the incident and then saw “friction” between settlers and Palestinians in the area. They called for other forces, who came and separated the groups. But the conflict that day continued. About 3 p.m., settlers gathered outside Awad Odeh’s home, about a half-mile from the first attack. Six armed and masked settlers tried to break into the home’s front gate while Odeh, his mother and three young children sheltered inside, according to photos, Odeh and witness accounts. “I saw on the [security] cameras there were settlers around our home destroying cars and shooting at windows,” Odeh said. “We hid in the house and they tried to get in, and they shot and swore at anyone they saw.” Odeh moved to the roof of his house and threw rocks at the settlers, who started throwing rocks back and shooting at him. “As soon as we got 10 to 15 meters out of our home, they shot at my family and injured my daughter, and I got shot right after,” Odeh said. “It was like an action movie. I didn’t expect to come out alive. I’ve never been in a position like this.” His cousin Muath Raed Odeh ran into the house to try to save Awad’s 6-year-old daughter, said a witness who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Muath was shot and later died at a hospital. Other Palestinians fled and dived for cover amid the barrage of gunshots. Abu Srour, the 17-year-old, was among those who didn’t escape. His body was found facedown atop a hillside near the house he was trying to defend. Abu Srour was shot in the back, according to a photo and his medical records, which revealed that the bullet “exited from the upper middle of the chest,” causing “bleeding and destroying the lungs.” At 3:40 p.m., a local Arabic-language Telegram channel,  , reported that three people had been killed in Qusra.

Israeli military orders specifically state that soldiers must prevent crimes such as manslaughter and deliberate damage to property. “We, as a military soldier, sovereign, the occupier, must protect Palestinians from settler violence,” said Ori Givati, the advocacy director of Breaking the Silence, an organization of veteran soldiers that compiles research and testimonies about events in the occupied territories. The failure of police and the army to respond effectively to the violence on Oct. 11 is clear from the evidence collected by The Post and shared with forensics and legal experts. Michael Sfard, a prominent human rights lawyer in Israel who reviewed the evidence, said he has worked on hundreds of settler violence cases and calls this pattern of inaction — in which soldiers and officers witness an attack and fail to intervene and   — “standing idly by.” In practice, “there has been a serious problem of implementing the law,” said Roni Pelli, a lawyer with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, who also reviewed the Oct. 11 evidence. “There’s no doubt that [the Israeli army] should have stopped it. They should have detained [the settlers] until the police comes and take them.” The gunshots were from pistols, according to audio forensics expert Steven Beck, who reviewed a Facebook Live video that captured the firing. Several settlers were seen carrying pistols that day. Beck and other audio forensics experts said the sounds of the gunfire were probably audible at the two military outposts, less than half a mile away. The Israeli official with knowledge of the incident said Israeli forces saw a vehicle leaving Qusra with “four individual settlers,” each with their “face covered.” At the same time, the forces received reports of dead and wounded Palestinians inside the village. The official said that no Israeli soldiers were at the scene when the fatal shootings took place but that they scanned the area for evidence afterward, finding bullet casings consistent with 9mm handguns. The first available visual evidence verified by The Post of Israeli security forces came about 4 p.m., when they were photographed removing surveillance footage from Awad Odeh’s home and handing it to Border Police officers. The Post requested access to the surveillance footage. The police declined, citing the open investigation. Qusra residents pointed to the IDF’s removal of the surveillance footage immediately after the attack as evidence of culpability. “[The authorities] came to take the DVR to hide their atrocities. They had to hide it,” Odeh said. The Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said of the settler attack: “Authorities in general have received intelligence, including from security forces on the ground, regarding the identities of the people who committed that crime but the authorities did not have prior knowledge of their identities.” The official said the attackers were not part of the Esh Kodesh civil defense squad — a unit of settlers that has been armed and trained by the military and operates under its supervision. Nor, he said, were they IDF reservists. The Esh Kodesh civil defense squad, which was near Qusra on Oct. 11 alongside IDF soldiers, declined to comment. Residents of Esh Kodesh declined to comment on the violence in Qusra that day, referring questions to a lawyer. He did not respond to requests for comment. Police said they arrested a 22-year-old resident of the Esh Kodesh area on Nov. 7 on suspicion of murder. A person with knowledge of the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, told The Post the arrest was linked to the Oct. 11 attack. The 22-year-old was held for about 20 minutes of questioning and then released on a restraining order prohibiting him from going to two Palestinian villages and from contacting 22 individuals, according to local media reports and confirmed by The Post. Police declined to say whether they recommended charges for anyone involved in the Oct. 11 attack. The Post could not identify any others who faced arrest or prosecution. Abu Srour’s mother, Aya, says she has just one regret about that day. “I wish that in the last moment, he came to me, I embraced him. That’s it.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAKBXBLRNVEXNBK45CTXXWIVKA.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAKBXBLRNVEXNBK45CTXXWIVKA.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAKBXBLRNVEXNBK45CTXXWIVKA.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAKBXBLRNVEXNBK45CTXXWIVKA.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAKBXBLRNVEXNBK45CTXXWIVKA.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAKBXBLRNVEXNBK45CTXXWIVKA.jpg&w=1200 1200w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAKBXBLRNVEXNBK45CTXXWIVKA.jpg&w=1440&impolicy=high_res 1440w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/01/09/israel-settler-violence-qusra-west-bank/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 07:01:00,

That’s when the one early state that looks somewhat close will hold its primary. As I wrote in my   on Monday ( ), it all comes down to whether   can keep it close or, better yet for her, win.

If any question remains about whether former president   will skate to the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, it could well be answered Jan. 23 in New Hampshire.

At that point she would hope to recast the rest of the nominating contest. Two new polls released Tuesday morning tell pretty different tales about how likely New Hampshire is to assist her. A   showed Haley creeping to within single digits of Trump, 39 percent to 32 percent. A  , meanwhile, showed she trails by 20 points, 46-26. So which might be closer to the mark? And what do they suggest about what lies ahead? The first thing to note is that both polls show Haley gaining. The CNN poll has Haley shrinking her deficit from 22 percentage points in November to seven points today. The Suffolk poll has her shrinking it from 30 points in late September to 20 points today. The CNN poll has long  indicated that Trump’s support in New Hampshire is   have shown, so its tightening looks more pronounced. Beyond that, there are a couple of key differences in the CNN and Suffolk polls. One difference is in voters who aren’t registered Republicans — a vital demographic that Haley needs to own, given Trump’s huge advantage among registered Republicans. While the CNN poll shows Haley leading among them by 26 points (43-17), the Suffolk poll shows her lead at just half that (36-23). The biggest difference, though, is education. While the CNN poll has Haley trailing by just 15 points (46-31) among voters with a high school education or less, the Suffolk poll shows Trump with a massive 70-point lead (80-10) among those voters. This is significant because Trump often  . It’s difficult to compare New Hampshire to other states or the national polls given its  . But if Haley is keeping it as close with these voters as the CNN poll suggests, that would be remarkable. (And they are a large chunk of the poll, accounting for 37 percent of the sample.) To the extent that the CNN poll does reflect reality, it could be particularly heartening for Haley. In addition to showing her trimming her deficit to single digits, it also shows both her and former New Jersey governor   (12 percent) combining for more votes than Trump. It’s the first high-quality poll to make such a finding. Christie has thus far rejected suggestions that he might make way for Haley in the name of trying to defeat Trump. But such comments are to be expected; you don’t signal you might drop out while you’re still hoping to compete. And Christie has criticized Trump more harshly than any other candidate, signaling early on that  . The CNN poll suggests that if Christie  , it would almost certainly bolster Haley further and possibly even allow her to compete for the win in the Granite State. Christie draws his support almost exclusively from those who aren’t registered Republicans (taking 23 percent of them), moderates (26 percent) and left-leaning voters (40 percent), compared with almost no support among registered Republicans or conservatives. Previous UNH Survey Center polling suggested Christie’s base overwhelmingly  . Haley is the clear home for those voters if Christie is no longer an option, and they still vote in the GOP primary. Trump could also benefit if Florida Gov.   (R) or   don’t make it to New Hampshire, given how much their bases overlap with his. DeSantis has become something of a nonfactor in New Hampshire, taking just 8 percent in the Suffolk poll and 5 percent in the CNN poll (which shows him in  behind Ramaswamy). And it’s plausible that their voters wouldn’t go as strongly for Trump as Christie’s would go for Haley, given that these are voters who have so far declined to back the presumptive nominee. What’s clear from the new polls is that while Iowa’s caucuses are next week, New Hampshire the following week is the ballgame, at least in the first two states. How competitive that ballgame will be — and whether Haley could actually reshape the race if she gets the outcome she needs — is to be determined.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMB5H4KD6WSTZSU7YWEHUKZN2M_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMB5H4KD6WSTZSU7YWEHUKZN2M_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMB5H4KD6WSTZSU7YWEHUKZN2M_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMB5H4KD6WSTZSU7YWEHUKZN2M_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMB5H4KD6WSTZSU7YWEHUKZN2M_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NMB5H4KD6WSTZSU7YWEHUKZN2M_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/how-close-is-nikki-haley-new-hampshire/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 13:10:00,

Just over a week into the new year, the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference is far from being sorted, but it appears as competitive as ever. No. 6 DeMatha proved as much Monday night in Arlington, where it knocked off No. 2 Bishop O’Connell, 64-50. “We just wanted to play DeMatha basketball tonight,” senior forward Malcolm Thomas said. “We just wanted to be on top of our stuff and not worry about anything else. That’s when we shine.” Just last week, O’Connell toppled Gonzaga, which was  . On that same night, DeMatha had its hands full with unranked Bishop McNamara — climbing back from a 21-point halftime deficit to earn a two-point win. “It’s a dogfight in this league every single night, anywhere you go,” DeMatha junior forward Kade Sebastian said. “We know very well that you have to come ready to compete.” The Knights (12-3), who   after that win over Gonzaga, boast one of the buzzier starting lineups in the area. They added high-major transfers in seniors AJ Swinton (a Florida State signee) and Bryson Tucker (a top-50 prospect). They have the size and talent to compete with anyone in the conference, but Monday night, it was the Stags’ disciplined, clinical approach that held sway. “We wanted to make life difficult for them tonight,” Stags Coach Mike Jones said. “We had a game plan to stop their weapons and hopefully play harder than them. It starts with trying to be in better shape than everyone we play, and then it comes down to execution.” Jones, in his  , employed a similar approach in his last stop at St. Stephen’s/St. Agnes in Alexandria. His Saints teams played with physicality and pace, often outworking their opponents. That mind-set worked just fine for DeMatha (13-3) on Monday: The Stags earned a key road win with a defense-first approach. On the offensive end, it was a balanced attack. Thomas finished with 12 points, freshman guard Jamaal McKnight Jr. had 12, and junior forward Charles Thomas added 11. “In December, I learned how resilient this group can be,” Jones said. “They’re not afraid of a big moment.

ANAHEIM, Calif. — The Anaheim Ducks traded defenseman Jamie Drysdale and a second-round pick in 2025 to the Flyers on Monday for high-scoring college left wing Cutter Gauthier, whose unwillingness to sign with Philadelphia catalyzed this swap of highly regarded youngsters. Flyers general manager Danny Briere said he traded Gauthier, the fifth overall pick in the 2022 draft, because Gauthier wouldn’t sign, train or even communicate with the Flyers. Gauthier refused to meet with Briere and Flyers President of Hockey Operations Keith Jones when they flew to Sweden last month to watch as Gauthier led the U.S. team to the  . “It was a long time coming,” Briere said. “It’s been going on for a while. We tried to give him space. We tried to get in touch with him many times. He would not communicate ... so at some point, we had to make a decision, and we thought with what happened just a few days ago, this was probably the time to get the highest value.” Gauthier initially told the Flyers that he wouldn’t join them last summer, a year after they drafted him. Briere said he purposely didn’t announce Gauthier’s reluctance or comment publicly on his increasingly awkward relationship with Philly’s top prospect. “It was to try to protect the kid,” Briere said. “We were hoping that at some point he would change his mind. He had already changed his mind. He looked at us at the draft and told us he was built to be a Flyer, wanted to be a Flyer, and then a few months later, told us that he didn’t want to be a Flyer, didn’t want to play for the Flyers. “So in our mind at first, we said, ‘We have to protect him, because if he changes his mind again, it’s going to be tough for him to put the uniform on.’ But when we realized that he refused to talk to us now, it’s been months and he didn’t want to be a Flyer, didn’t want to be in Philadelphia, it was time to make it happen.” Asked for his reaction to Gauthier’s disinterest in playing in Philadelphia, Flyers coach John Tortorella said, “Then, we don’t want you.” Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek said he has spoken to Gauthier, who “was really excited when I talked to him, so that made me very, very happy.” The Ducks have a wealth of talented young defensemen in their system, including the Defenseman of the Year in all three Canadian major junior leagues. “It’s such a good deal for us,” Tortorella said of getting Drysdale after   on Monday night. “In the process we’re at right now, it’s perfect timing. Really excited.” Verbeek used one of his top blue-line talents to boost the Ducks, who have scored the NHL’s second-fewest goals over the past three seasons. “We do not have a player like this in our prospect pool,” Verbeek said of Gauthier. “He has obviously top-six (forward) talent. He’s a gifted skater. For me, he has elite skating ability. He’s got an elite NHL shot already, and he’s a goal-scorer. He likes to shoot the puck, and based on some of the players that we have up front, I think he’s going to complement them really well.” Verbeek said Gauthier will finish his sophomore year at Boston College before the Ducks “circle back with him when the season is over” to determine his next step. The 21-year-old Drysdale was the sixth overall pick in the 2020 draft by Anaheim, and he has grown into a puck-moving defenseman who had 32 points during his first full NHL season in 2021-22. After missing nearly all of last season due to injury and getting a late start to this season because of another injury, Drysdale has one goal and four assists in 10 games for Anaheim. “I really like Jamie Drysdale as a player,” Verbeek said. ”(But) I had to look at our overall group, and I think based on all the 18 one-goal games we’ve lost this year, I wanted to give the group someone that could help us get over the hump.” Gauthier was outstanding at the World Junior Championship, tying for the tournament lead with 12 points and scoring the game-winning goal in the third period of the semifinal match. He also has 23 points in just 17 games this season for Boston College after getting 37 points in 32 games last season as a freshman for the Eagles. ___ AP NHL: ","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP3XCSVORAI65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP3XCSVORAI65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP3XCSVORAI65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP3XCSVORAI65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP3XCSVORAI65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XP3XCSVORAI65GRSLSPGVIULHM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2024/01/08/flyers-ducks-trade-drysdale-gauthier/becb71dc-ae88-11ee-9a32-5c9e6aa28b3b_story.html,Washington Post,2024-01-08 22:40:00,
"Golden State Warriors guard Chris Paul will undergo surgery next week to address a fractured left hand, the team announced Friday.

Golden State Warriors guard Chris Paul will undergo surgery next week to address a fractured left hand, the team announced Friday. Paul, 38, appeared to suffer the injury during the second half of a 113-109 home win over the Detroit Pistons. His timetable for a return to the court is unknown. With a little over six minutes remaining in the third quarter, Paul missed a three-pointer from the right angle. As the shot caromed off the rim back toward him, Paul chased after the rebound, which was eventually controlled by Pistons guard Jaden Ivey. Paul pulled back as Ivey secured the ball, but the players made contact and Paul immediately flexed and clutched his left hand. The 12-time all-star headed straight to the locker room and did not return, finishing with eight points and four assists in 24 minutes. Chris Paul went to the locker room after appearing to injure his hand on this play  The future Hall of Famer has suffered multiple hand injuries during his 19-year career, including a broken right hand during the 2016 playoffs when he was a member of the Los Angeles Clippers and a thumb injury that sidelined him for a month during the 2021-22 season when he played for the Phoenix Suns. This latest injury comes at an inopportune time for the Warriors (17-18), who have been without forward Draymond Green since Dec. 12   for delivering a blow to the head of Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkic. Coach Steve Kerr also has faced questions about his rotations and game management in recent days; his team has blown several fourth-quarter leads and struggled to pull out wins in close games. “I feel so bad for Chris,” Kerr said. “I know he’s had a couple of hand surgeries before, I believe. I saw him holding it and instantly was worried. … It’s going to be tough [without him]. Chris is an all-time great. He’s fit right into our team and made life so much easier, not only on [Stephen Curry], but he’s kind of captained that second unit, which has been a strong suit for us. We’re going to miss him in both lineups.” In Paul’s absence, Kerr said he will turn to rookie Brandin Podziemski and veteran Cory Joseph, adding that Moses Moody, a 2021 lottery pick, should also get the opportunity for more minutes. “You’re replacing 30 minutes from Chris,” Kerr said. “We won’t replace all of those minutes with one guy. We’ll probably spread them out. But I’m excited to get Moses back out there.” With the Warriors clinging to the last spot in the Western Conference play-in tournament field despite a league-leading $208 million payroll, they are widely believed to be exploring all options in advance of the Feb. 8 trade deadline. The upcoming deadline is viewed as a potential crossroads for an organization that has won four titles since 2015; key veterans such as Green, Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins have slumped while younger players such as Moody and Jonathan Kuminga have sought larger roles. Paul, who is on the books for $30.8 million this season, was acquired from the Washington Wizards   for Jordan Poole and has averaged career lows of 8.9 points and 7.2 assists while alternating between the Warriors’ starting lineup and second unit. Because Paul’s $30 million salary for the 2024-25 season is not guaranteed, he could be an attractive trade target for a team looking to cut its future salary obligations.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QXQJCBWSIK6G4G7MWPQLXGNIE_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QXQJCBWSIK6G4G7MWPQLXGNIE_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QXQJCBWSIK6G4G7MWPQLXGNIE_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QXQJCBWSIK6G4G7MWPQLXGNIE_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QXQJCBWSIK6G4G7MWPQLXGNIE_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7QXQJCBWSIK6G4G7MWPQLXGNIE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/warriors-chris-paul-fractures-hand/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 08:14:00,
"HOUSTON — The famed football program at Michigan, which had lingered for two decades in that murky wilderness of good-but-not-great, even fading to afterthought at times, spent Monday night finishing a steep three-year climb to the summit it always craves. It deprogrammed the dazzling Washington offense, ran the football like a fleet brute and bested the Huskies, 34-13, in the College Football Playoff national championship game, finishing 15-0 and grabbing Michigan’s first national title in 26 wanting years. Given its enormous alumni base, its merriment might just prove loud and long. HOUSTON — The famed football program at Michigan, which had lingered for two decades in that murky wilderness of good-but-not-great, even fading to afterthought at times, spent Monday night finishing a steep three-year climb to the summit it always craves. It deprogrammed the dazzling Washington offense, ran the football like a fleet brute and bested the Huskies, 34-13, in the College Football Playoff national championship game, finishing 15-0 and grabbing Michigan’s first national title in 26 wanting years. Given its enormous alumni base, its merriment might just prove loud and long. “I’ll leave y’all with this: Business is finished!” the emblematic graduate running back Blake Corum said on the victory podium with the confetti raining, and fittingly, it was Corum who had finished it. When he scored on runs of 12 yards with 7:09 left and one yard with 3:37 left, he untangled a game that long had stood at 20-13. Of course, it stood that way for that long because the great Michigan defense stalled three straight Washington possessions that began while that score still teetered. Then that defense set up Corum’s second score when Mike Sainristil, “an amazing stalwart of a player” according to Coach Jim Harbaugh, ran 81 yards with an interception and loosed a boom both giddy and relieved from the Michigan majority of the 72,808 at NRG Stadium. That play made the outcome clear, and that outcome led the long-famous Harbaugh, Michigan’s quarterback in the 1980s and ninth-year coach these days, to revert to the family dining situation. “For me personally, I can now sit at the big person’s table in the family,” he said, alluding to his father Jack’s FCS championship with Western Kentucky in 2002 and his brother John’s Super Bowl win with the Baltimore Ravens in 2012-13. “They won’t keep me on the little table over there anymore.” He got to the table and the podium on a night when his team completed an emphatic six-game streak through both bowl teams and top-four teams: Penn State, Maryland, Ohio State, Iowa, Alabama and Washington, which finished a superb 14-1 in a second straight breakthrough season under  , who stands 26-3 in Seattle. Michigan weathered that gantlet to reach 40-3 (.930) in the past three seasons, including two playoff disappointments, after the program went 168-91 (.648) from 2000 to 2020 and 49-22 (.690) in Harbaugh’s first six seasons after a ballyhooed hiring from the San Francisco 49ers. And Michigan did its work while the noise around it cascaded owing to a scandal of Michigan’s own making — the saga, revealed in late October by Yahoo Sports, in which a Michigan staffer conducted an elaborate scheme of sign-stealing from future opponents, forbidden by the NCAA in a 30-year-old rule. The NCAA continues its investigation with no telling how it might affect the standing of this clinched title. In that process, Harbaugh served a  , in the same season he began with a three-game suspension because of recruiting violations. He ended all that by saying: “It couldn’t have gone better. It went exactly how we wanted to go, to win every game. Off-the-field issues, we’re innocent and we stood strong and tall because we knew we were innocent. And overcome that, it wasn’t that hard because we knew we were innocent . . . It went exactly how we wanted it to go. It went exactly how we wanted it to go.” It reached the point of “everything I imagined,” as Corum put it, because Michigan rushed for 303 yards and eight yards per carry, but also because its defense choked off the space preferred by quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and his soaring receivers, and the secondary, especially Sainristil, kept demonstrating its keen tackling capabilities. “The tackling — we missed a couple, but just a couple,” Harbaugh said. “Today was a complete, complete team effort,” Corum said. “There were so many people making plays out there.” That began early, when Michigan vaulted ahead 17-3 with a whoa of 178 rushing yards on eight carries in the first quarter, making galloping runs through gaping lanes amid galvanizing roars. Donovan Edwards danced from inside to outside each time on touchdown runs of 41 and 46 yards on his path toward 104, and Corum ran to freedom up the left side for a 59-yard run to help arrange a field goal. “Misfits,” Washington linebacker Edefuan Ulofoshio said of the open lanes allowed, soon adding, “We got it corrected, but in a game like this we can’t make explosive mistakes like that.” From there, it kept its lead throughout by souring the numbers for Penix, who couldn’t find the precision or the space that lit up his brilliant   against Texas, when he went 29 for 38 for 430 yards. Here, he went 27 for 51 for 255, and his team produced its lowest point total of the season, and he missed two chances that will ache a good long while, both overthrown to the great wide receiver Rome Odunze: one in the end zone in the first quarter, and one on a fourth-down play where he saw Odunze out alone in the deep right corner in the second. The three possessions taken within that 20-13 score wound up five plays for 11 yards, five plays for 18 and three plays for one. “I don’t feel like we were confused or anything like that,” Penix said. “I just feel like it came down to executing. I missed a couple of throws, just a couple of reads on routes and stuff like that.” It felt as if Michigan’s defense had a cumulative effect, especially given the offense doesn’t tend to contribute any turnovers — only eight all year, and zero Monday night. That effect held long enough that eventually the Michigan offense awakened with quarterback J.J. McCarthy’s play-action, 41-yard pass to tight end Colston Loveland through the middle of the field to set up Corum’s first touchdown. Soon Penix, the sixth-year player whose four years at Indiana menaced with four harsh injuries until his two years at Washington brought joy, wound up with “hurt,” he said, even as, “In the locker room, it’s just a lot of love.” “You could tell in the locker room,” DeBoer said, “that they left it all out there just by the pain they’re going through.” Time and again and again they had forged narrow victories as if immune from stress until, DeBoer said, “I truly felt like, five minutes to go [and the score 27-13 and Washington driving before Sainristil’s fourth-down interception], there was nothing but belief.” DeBoer said, “It’s just such a fine line, we’ve seen it all year, between winning and losing. And I feel like I know what the score looks like, but I feel like that fine line was right there again tonight.” And he said, “We just couldn’t make that one play here and there.” And the coach whose 21-game winning streak had just rammed against a mighty force said: “I’m sorry. I’m sorry that they couldn’t realize a championship this year, because they made the sacrifices, they made the commitments,” but said, “They’ve given to me everything they possibly can,” and, “They’ve restored U-Dub football.” It’s just that that self-restoration had smacked up against a self-reinvention.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DQXUVEHG2MZHMNIQGOFTNBEJ4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DQXUVEHG2MZHMNIQGOFTNBEJ4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DQXUVEHG2MZHMNIQGOFTNBEJ4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DQXUVEHG2MZHMNIQGOFTNBEJ4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DQXUVEHG2MZHMNIQGOFTNBEJ4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6DQXUVEHG2MZHMNIQGOFTNBEJ4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/michigan-washington-wolverines-national-champion/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 02:08:00,
"South Korea’s parliament passed a bill that will make it illegal to breed, slaughter and sell dogs for human consumption — a victory for animal rights groups that had been  .

South Korea’s parliament passed a bill that will make it illegal to breed, slaughter and sell dogs for human consumption — a victory for animal rights groups that had been  . The   Tuesday in favor of the bill — 208 lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favor and two abstained — highlights the cultural and political shift in South Korea around dog meat consumption and the industry that underpins the practice. Dog meat has increasingly fallen out of favor as pet ownership has risen and concerns over animal welfare have been more widely adopted. In a  conducted in 2022, more than 60 percent of South Koreans viewed the consumption of dog meat unfavorable. Only 8 percent had eaten dog meat in the previous year, down from 27 percent in 2015. The shift has been particularly pronounced among younger generations. After the National Assembly vote on Tuesday,   the bill’s passage as a historic moment for the country. “I never thought I would see in my lifetime a ban on the cruel dog meat industry in South Korea,” JungAh Chae, executive director of Humane Society International Korea, said in a statement. “We reached a tipping point where most Korean citizens reject eating dogs.” But some dog farmers   the Associated Press they planned to challenge the bill in South Korea’s constitutional Court. Under the  , a ban on trading dog meat will be enforced starting in 2027. After that, slaughtering dogs for consumption could lead to penalties of up to three years in prison or 30 million South Korean won, about $22,800, in fines. Breeding and selling dogs for human consumption could be punishable by up to two years in prison or a fine of 20 million won, about $15,200. The bill does not make eating dog meat a crime. Businesses that breed, slaughter and sell dogs will be eligible for government compensation when they submit a plan to local authorities outlining how they plan to shut down their operations or transition to another industry. Rights groups such as Humane Society International Korea have helped   to growing crops, such as blueberries, medicinal herbs or parsley. Groups representing dog farmers opposed the bill, arguing that a ban would deprive them of their livelihoods and infringe on people’s rights. Some South Koreans continue to eat dog meat, especially on the  , known as “Boknal,” when some believe that consuming dog meat dishes such as “bosintang” soup is good for the body. Son Won Hak, a farmer and former leader of a farmers’ association,   the Associated Press the bill was “a clear case of state violence as they are infringing on our freedom to choose our occupation.” He told the AP dog farmers will file a petition challenging the bill’s constitutionality. Joo Young-bong, head of the Korea Dog Meat Farmers’ Association,   in November, when the bill was first proposed, that it was “unviable.” “Transitioning off our lifelong job is a difficult and unsustainable option for us farmers in 60s or 70s,” he said. There are 1,156 registered dog farms in South Korea and 1,666 restaurants that sell dog meat each year,   to government data cited by the Korea Times. Groups representing breeders and farmers   the true numbers are two to three times higher. Past efforts to outlaw dog meat in South Korea have failed in part due to opposition from the industry. A protest against the bill organized by the Korea Dog Meat Farmers’ Association in November near the presidential palace in Seoul turned chaotic, with some protesters confronting police,   to Reuters. But animal rights groups say public attitudes have changed — in part because more South Koreans now own dogs as pets and feel more strongly about protecting them. According to the  , 3.02 million dogs were kept as pets in South Korea in 2022, up from 1.3 million in 2018. , the bill was also backed by South Korea’s president,  , and his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, who are known as animal lovers and own several dogs and cats. Kim attended an animal rights event in August and said that “dog meat consumption should come to an end … in an era when humans and pets coexist as friends.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRNJSEDWEAYHM4YTMNMUYDQDOI_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRNJSEDWEAYHM4YTMNMUYDQDOI_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRNJSEDWEAYHM4YTMNMUYDQDOI_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRNJSEDWEAYHM4YTMNMUYDQDOI_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRNJSEDWEAYHM4YTMNMUYDQDOI_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRNJSEDWEAYHM4YTMNMUYDQDOI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/09/south-korea-dog-meat-ban/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 08:47:00,
"Week 18 finalized the playoff bracket, and it accurately represents the oddity of the season. Joe Flacco is in, but Trevor Lawrence is nowhere to be found. The teams that lost Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers made it. Three teams from the AFC North are there — just not the one that won the division the past two years. Detroit is hosting a playoff game, which last happened 30 years ago. Here is what to know. Week 18 finalized the playoff bracket, and it accurately represents the oddity of the season. Joe Flacco is in, but Trevor Lawrence is nowhere to be found. The teams that lost Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers made it. Three teams from the AFC North are there — just not the one that won the division the past two years. Detroit is hosting a playoff game, which last happened 30 years ago. Here is what to know.  The operative question in Philadelphia the past month has been, “What happened to the Eagles, anyway?” On Sunday afternoon, with the playoffs looming, the question became, “Holy mother of God, what is going on, and where do we riot?” Coming off a game in which the Cardinals bullied them for their fourth loss in five weeks, things got so much worse for the Eagles. The New York Giants destroyed them so thoroughly that Coach Nick Sirianni conceded the NFC East shortly before halftime, wide receiver A.J. Brown limped off the field after he grabbed his right knee while writhing on the ground, and quarterback Jalen Hurts completed 7 of 16 passes before leaving with a disfigured middle finger on his throwing hand. The  , so the result did not affect the Eagles’ playoff seeding. But the way Philadelphia played when it could still win the NFC East was startling. Before Marcus Mariota replaced Hurts at the end of the first half, the Eagles had gained 93 yards and trailed 24-0. The defense Sirianni tabbed Matt Patricia to fix midseason yielded huge chunks of yardage to a 5-11 Giants team playing for nothing. The Eagles eventually lost, 27-10. The reigning NFC champions have mostly the same personnel that nearly won last year’s Super Bowl and started this season 10-1. But their secondary has aged, their young defensive tackles faded late in the year, and their pass rush has been merely good rather than taking over games. Hurts regressed over the second half of the season, showing newfound indecisiveness. Now the Eagles might have to face the fourth-seeded Buccaneers in Tampa without Brown, who did not return after his right leg folded at an awkward angle following a catch in the first quarter. If the Eagles cannot regroup and end up bowing out in the first round, it may not be a guarantee that Sirianni’s job is safe. It would be a stunning fate for a coach that compiled a 28-3 stretch that ended late this season. But the thoroughness of the Eagles’ collapse raises extreme questions.  For the second straight season, the Packers faced a streaking division rival at home in Week 18 with a playoff spot on the line. Rodgers’s Green Bay tenure ended when he faltered against the Detroit Lions. On Sunday at Lambeau Field, Love carried the Packers into the playoffs with a 17-9 victory over the Chicago Bears. Coordinator Joe Barry’s maligned defense held Justin Fields and the Bears’ surging offense without a touchdown, but Love was the star. He completed 27 of 32 passes for 316 yards — 112 to ascending rookie Jayden Reed — and two touchdowns with no interceptions. This offseason, the Packers decided against adding veteran wideouts and felt confident enough in Love to hand him a wide receiving corps composed entirely of rookies and second-year players. General Manager Brian Gutekunst envisioned Love and the receivers growing together over the course of the season, and that’s what happened. The Packers won seven of their last 10 games, and they’ll head to second-seeded Dallas playing their best of the season. The Bills’ division-clinching, 21-14 victory over the Miami Dolphins on Sunday night mirrored the arc of their season. They spent the first half lighting points on fire. Josh Allen did things no other quarterback can do and things no other quarterback should do. Sean McDermott’s defense played well, and his team’s execution in the clutch was questionable. The Bills never quite played their best. And yet they won. The Bills committed three turnovers and came away without points five times after driving inside the Miami 40. They also held the Dolphins’ pyrotechnic offense scoreless in the second half, got a massive punt return touchdown from Deonte Harty and used Allen as a battering ram to control the clock in the fourth quarter. The Bills were 6-6 and seeded 11th five weeks ago. Now, they’re the No. 2 seed and will play at home to open the playoffs. Up first is the Steelers, probably without T.J. Watt. The Dolphins will have to regroup. They have to play Patrick Mahomes on the road to start the playoffs. They had already lost their two best rushers for the season, and Sunday night Andrew Van Ginkel, their best remaining outside rusher, left with a foot injury and did not return. Tyreek Hill limped off the field the play before Tua Tagovailoa’s clinching interception. Miami went 4-4 away from Miami, including a loss in Germany to the Chiefs in Week 9. The Dolphins will look at the division title banner hanging in Buffalo for years to come and rue their Week 14 loss to the Titans, when they unfathomably blew a 14-point lead in the final three minutes.  When the Lions shipped Matthew Stafford to the Rams for Jared Goff and a haul of draft picks three years ago, it jump-started Detroit’s rebuild and led to the Rams’ Super Bowl title. Both teams won the trade, but only one can win next week. Stafford will play in a stadium where he set most every franchise record. Goff will face Sean McVay, the coach who decided he wasn’t good enough and benched him for a playoff game before he traded him. Goff may be without one of his best weapons. By playing their starters and dominating the Minnesota Vikings in a 30-20 victory, the Lions gathered momentum and temporarily gave themselves a remote shot at the NFC’s second seed. It also may have cost them tight end Sam LaPorta. As he caught a slant late in the first half, LaPorta’s left knee bent backward, and he rode on a cart into the locker room. LaPorta had one of the best rookie tight end seasons ever, emerging as the Lions’ secondary receiving threat behind star wideout Amon-Ra St. Brown. The Lions also provided the cheekiest moment of Week 18. One week after the controversial officiating mix-up over which Lions offensive lineman had reported as an eligible receiver, Dan Skipper reported as an eligible receiver — and caught a pass. The Lions made Dan Skipper eligible (this time by design) for a play today and threw him a pass 😂😂😂   The offseason grew murky in Jacksonville after the Jaguars completed a shocking collapse with a 28-20 loss to the Titans, who manhandled them behind Derrick Henry’s 153 rushing yards. The Jaguars were 8-3 six weeks ago and, according to odds determined by Pro Football Focus, had a 96 percent chance to make the playoffs. They won one of their final six games and fell out of the postseason with a franchise-destabilizing loss. The Jaguars entered this season as a team on the rise. They were coming off a playoff victory. They had Lawrence on an inexpensive rookie contract. They had a coach, Doug Pederson, who had transformed them in one season. Now, they have questions. Is Lawrence  ? He played through injuries and missed top wide receiver Christian Kirk down the stretch, but he did not look like an elite quarterback. One of the lasting images of the season will be Lawrence sailing a pass over the fingers of wide-open Calvin Ridley with two minutes left Sunday, missing what could have been a game-tying touchdown. Is Pederson a coach who can build a sustained winner? The Jaguars’ blocking and tackling utterly broke down, as one crucial sequence Sunday typified. Midway through the fourth quarter, the Jaguars trailed 28-20 and faced third and goal from the Titans’ 1-yard line. Pederson called a too-cute rollout from a funky formation that never had a chance. On fourth down, the Titans overwhelmed Jacksonville’s offensive line and stuffed Lawrence as he attempted to leap over the goal line. The result provided Henry, who is expected to part with the Titans, a happy send-off. Afterward, he found a microphone and thanked Titans fans for “the greatest eight years of my life.”  Years from now, the way it ended for Belichick and the Patriots will hardly be a footnote, blotted out by Lombardi Trophies and duck boat parades. In the moment, it provided a reminder that in the NFL  . In a driving snowstorm, the Patriots managed six first downs and 119 yards in a 17-3 loss to the New York Jets, the divisional rival Belichick for years savored thumping, that finalized their record at 4-13. Afterward, Belichick shuffled to midfield to shake hands with Coach Robert Saleh and hug Rodgers. He ignored photographers as he trod down steps to the Patriots’ locker room, shrouded in a parka and ski mask that covered all but his eyes. “Disappointing year for all of us,” Belichick said afterward, his voice hoarse and soft. Nothing has been formalized about Belichick’s future, but it certainly felt like his last game. Former Patriots offensive coordinator (and fired Raiders coach) Josh McDaniels, who worked for Belichick for nearly two decades and won six Super Bowls with him, attended the game. Allowing that the game was played in a blizzard, the loss showed why owner Robert Kraft may be ready to move on. Since Brady’s departure, which Belichick enabled, Belichick could not find any answers on offense. He hired the wrong play-callers, signed the wrong free agents, drafted the wrong players and ruined a quarterback he picked 15th. The Patriots own the third pick, and Belichick’s recent track record does not recommend letting him make it.  At this time last year, few franchises had a bleaker outlook than Houston. The Texans had won 11 games over three seasons under three different coaches. A miraculous Week 18 victory dropped their 2023 draft position from first to second. They would start over with a new coach, DeMeco Ryans, and the quarterback who fell to them, C.J. Stroud. Any success appeared to be a speck on the horizon. But there was Stroud on Saturday night, skipping down a hallway outside the Texans’ locker room and hopping into Ryans’s arms, celebrating a nail-biting, 23-19 victory over the Indianapolis Colts. When the Jaguars lost Sunday, it meant the 10-7 Texans would host a playoff game as the AFC South champions. Together, along with standout rookies Will Anderson Jr. and Tank Dell, Stroud and Ryans changed Houston in one season. Nico Collins, in just his third season, capped   by catching nine passes for 195 yards and a touchdown. Stroud completed 20 of 26 attempts for 264 yards and two touchdowns, but his stats didn’t illustrate the combination of poise and wizardry he played with in the biggest game of his life. Stroud will be giving 16 years to Cleveland’s Joe Flacco in the Texans’ first-round matchup, but it shouldn’t surprise anybody if the Texans win. Few teams have a brighter future than Houston, and the present isn’t bad, either.  One play Sunday demonstrated the tiny margin on which seasons can swing. In a scoreless game early in the second quarter, Panthers quarterback Bryce Young swung a pass to DJ Chark in the flat. Chark raced down the sideline, reached the end zone and dived over the pylon. As replay showed, Buccaneers safety Antoine Winfield Jr. poked the ball out of Chark’s grasp inches from the goal line. Rather than taking a 7-0 lead and placing immense pressure on a struggling offense, the Panthers handed the ball back to Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers did not score a touchdown, but their 9-0 victory still clinched their third consecutive NFC South title. Baker Mayfield will lead the Bucs into the playoffs with a better record, by one game, than Brady managed in his final season. Oddly, the ageless Mike Evans gained more yards catching passes from Mayfield (1,255) than he did in any of his three seasons with Brady. The Panthers were shut out in the final two games of Young’s rookie season, during which they finished with the worst record in the league and promptly shipped the No. 1 pick to the Bears. There are probably worse positions to be in, but it’s hard to think of what they are.  Former assistants of either Mike or Kyle Shanahan coach five of the 14 playoff teams: the Packers (Matt LaFleur), Rams (McVay), Dolphins (Mike McDaniel), Texans (Ryans) and, of course, the 49ers (Kyle Shanahan). For several recent seasons, Andy Reid’s coaching tree dominated. It’s now Kyle and Mike. That’s something to keep in mind during the hiring cycle.  In the big picture, no team got luckier in the final week than the Steelers, whose three-game winning streak salvaged a messy season and vaulted them into a first-round trip to Buffalo as the AFC’s No. 7 seed. Pittsburgh received two major breaks in the final weekend. On Saturday, it outlasted the Ravens, 17-10, in the driving rain as Baltimore sat many key players, including presumptive MVP Lamar Jackson. Avoiding Jackson has been a theme for the Steelers: He was injured for both meetings last season and sat once against the Steelers in 2021 and 2020. Even with their 10th victory, the Steelers still needed the 5-11 Titans to upset the Jaguars. The Titans dominated, and Mike Tomlin made the playoffs for the first time post-Ben Roethlisberger. The Steelers are trying for their first postseason victory since the 2016 season. One significant break went against them: T.J. Watt probably won’t play in the first round after he sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee against the Ravens.  Smith coached his last game with the Falcons and completed his Atlanta tenure with a 21-30 record and no playoff appearances — and he went out with one final piece of loser behavior. In the final 90 seconds of the Saints’ 48-17 victory over the Falcons, Tyrann Mathieu returned an interception to the 1-yard line. Rather than kneeling to end the game, the Saints handed off to running back Jamaal Williams for a touchdown. At the final whistle, Smith marched to midfield and cursed at Saints Coach Dennis Allen, asking why he had piled on. Arthur Smith and Dennis Allen have a postgame chat 😳  Three things are true: Sportsmanship matters. Smith’s anger was perfectly understandable. Allen began his postgame news conference by apologizing to Smith, explaining that he had called for the Saints to take a knee, but Saints players wanted to get Williams, a beloved teammate, a touchdown. None of that validates Smith’s actions. The NFL is a cutthroat business, and the only way to make sure another team doesn’t do something you don’t want it to do is to stop it. By screaming at Allen as the clock ran out on his season, his team soundly embarrassed, Smith came off as whiny and small. He was out of a job just hours later.  Whether it was   for the duration of the play clock,   or  , NFL players losing their minds because a statistical achievement added cash to their bank account is a Week 18 feature to be cherished.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFJGBA3UCZ2WNIHKQIGIRFJP54.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFJGBA3UCZ2WNIHKQIGIRFJP54.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFJGBA3UCZ2WNIHKQIGIRFJP54.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFJGBA3UCZ2WNIHKQIGIRFJP54.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFJGBA3UCZ2WNIHKQIGIRFJP54.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KFJGBA3UCZ2WNIHKQIGIRFJP54.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/nfl-best-worst-week-18/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 06:20:00,
"President Biden’s visit to South Carolina on Monday and the speech he gave at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston have been connected, including by the president, to his speech at Valley Forge, Pa., last week: a multipronged response to Donald Trump’s enduring political strength and the threat that poses to American democracy. President Biden’s visit to South Carolina on Monday and the speech he gave at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston have been connected, including by the president, to his speech at Valley Forge, Pa., last week: a multipronged response to Donald Trump’s enduring political strength and the threat that poses to American democracy. Considering   on Monday, though, one might be forgiven for noticing that it had a less lofty intent as well. The president, speaking at the historically Black church, offered a list of accomplishments selected to highlight how he’s worked for the Black community. Biden’s bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination was resurrected by Black voters in South Carolina, so he feels both an unusual affinity for and obligation to that particular constituency. But the speech wasn’t solely about making the case to Black voters. He was speaking from the church where, in 2015, a White man citing racist beliefs gunned down   — a tactile reminder of the threat posed by white supremacy. And he used that reminder to sharpen points he’d made in Valley Forge: America’s past shows how race and the threat to democracy overlap. Biden repeated a theme he’d offered in Pennsylvania about Trump and Trump’s approach to politics. “The truth is under assault in America,” Biden said. “As a consequence, so is our freedom, our democracy, our very country.” After a brief interruption from protesters calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, he continued. Trump’s rejection of his 2020 loss, Biden argued, had a precursor. “Look, after the Civil War, the defeated Confederates couldn’t accept the verdict of the war: They had lost,” the president said. “So, they embraced what’s known as the ‘Lost Cause,’ a self-serving lie that the Civil War was not about slavery but about states’ rights. And they’ve called that the noble cause.” Here, again, political machinations intruded on his more high-minded point: The failure of former South Carolina governor   (R) last month   was obviously on his mind here. (A bit later, he made this more obvious to the audience.) The post-Civil War rhetoric in the South wasn’t just a lie, he continued, but “had terrible consequences. It brought on Jim Crow.” “We’re living in an era of a second lost cause,” he continued. “Once again, there are some in this country trying — trying to turn a loss into a lie — a lie, which if allowed to live, will once again bring terrible damage to this country.” The argument is uncomplicated: Lies about losses threaten the country. But Biden could have been more specific. The Jim Crow era, the period during which the rights of Black Americans were systematically suppressed in the American South, wasn’t simply about where people could eat or ride the bus or drink water, though it included all of those elements. It was also centrally about suppressing the political power of Black Americans. The 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870, granted Black men the right to vote. Women, including Black women, weren’t allowed to until 1920. But Southern states soon implemented laws and processes aimed at limiting participation by Black voters, from laws mandating that voters pass literacy tests — quizzes meant to be   or subjective — to rules limiting voting to people whose grandfathers were also able to vote, a constraint that excluded people whose grandfathers had been enslaved. American democracy, one can reasonably argue, has only been fully in force and protected since the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. That, too, is overly simple, given   to constrain  , including a   of the VRA. We see it manifested, too, in Trump’s rhetoric about purported fraud, claims that incessantly focus on heavily Black cities (such as Detroit and Philadelphia, where he did better in 2020 than in 2016) and in the targets he identifies as purveyors of fraud, such as  . There’s a broader theme at play here, too. Trump’s politics are intertwined with appeals to the racial anxiety of White Americans. He became a central voice in elevating false assertions about Barack Obama’s Americanness in 2011, and in 2016 polling indicated that a sense that “Whites are losing” was   of support for his bid for the Republican nomination than economic insecurity. Historian Thomas Zimmer,   on the long-term interpretation of the Capitol riot — the culmination of Trump’s efforts to reject the 2020 election — noted that such anxiety has repeatedly threatened the stability of our government or resulted in  . Zimmer noted frequent comparisons between Adolf Hitler’s failed effort to overthrow the German government in 1923 with  , 2021. But this was imperfect. “I believe we should pay more attention to how moments of social and racial progress in the United States were met with violent counter-mobilizations,” he wrote on Substack, “against the country’s first attempt at interracial democracy after the Civil War for instance, or against the civil rights revolution in the 1950s and ’60s.” There’s a history of backlash against racial groups and of political actors leveraging that backlash for their own power. The backlash of the moment, though, doesn’t center primarily on Black Americans. Since the 1960s and the loosening of restrictions on immigration, America’s racial tensions have shifted from focusing solely on the divide in power between Black and White to now include far more racial groups. Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric, particularly (but  ) of late, has centered on the purported danger of immigrants crossing into the United States from Mexico — populations that are heavily Hispanic. There are conflicts between racial groups that make efforts to create a unified political force of minority voters tricky. But many on the right in particular see non-Whites as a unified threat to their own primacy. Researchers from New York University and University of Massachusetts at Amherst   research in 2021 measuring the perception among Whites that non-Whites are somehow working together to challenge White power — a theory that there exists “minority collusion” that undermines the White majority. “There was a marked increase in agreement with the idea that minority collusion is happening over the course of the survey,” researcher Eric Knowles told me at the time. (The survey was in the field from 2015 to 2018, during Trump’s rise to power.) This perception, though, “was driven only by an increase in this minority collusion belief among White Republicans.” You can see how all of this overlaps: Trump’s rejection of democracy and heightening the concerns of his mostly White base and his leveraging their fears about diminishing status. It is, as Zimmer writes, something we’ve seen before. It’s something that, in the past, has constrained American democracy. Yes, Biden was in South Carolina to make the case to Black voters on what he’s accomplished. But he was also reinforcing his broader message about this moment of unusual precarity for the country.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LADFHPRPMXE2BVXVZSA3HVNK2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LADFHPRPMXE2BVXVZSA3HVNK2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LADFHPRPMXE2BVXVZSA3HVNK2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LADFHPRPMXE2BVXVZSA3HVNK2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LADFHPRPMXE2BVXVZSA3HVNK2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LADFHPRPMXE2BVXVZSA3HVNK2E_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/democracy-race-jan6-trump-biden/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 13:20:00,
"Even Cameron Millsapps didn’t expect the start of her first wrestling season to go this well. At the Battle at the Bridge tournament Dec. 30, the Wakefield junior took home the 152-pound title in the girls’ event to improve to 14-0. Her final match, a decision victory, was the first time she didn’t pin her opponent. Even Cameron Millsapps didn’t expect the start of her first wrestling season to go this well. At the Battle at the Bridge tournament Dec. 30, the Wakefield junior took home the 152-pound title in the girls’ event to improve to 14-0. Her final match, a decision victory, was the first time she didn’t pin her opponent. “I was proud of myself to finish first at an event like that,” Millsapps said. “ … [The season is] going really well — better than I thought it would.” Millsapps’s jujitsu background helped her transition to wrestling. When she first took the mat this past offseason, Wakefield Coach John Leinberger noticed her movement and spatial awareness — skills that usually take time to develop. Although endurance was a work in progress, it didn’t matter; none of Millsapps’s opponents before the Battle at the Bridge made it out of the first period. “Every match she went out there, it was just a double-leg half nelson pin and nobody could last the entire period against her,” Leinberger said. Millsapps entered the Battle at the Bridge nervous about the prospect of wrestling longer than she had before. But she stayed focused and relied on her improved conditioning. “I just kept talking to myself and thinking about what my next move would be,” Millsapps said. “I tried to really listen to what my coaches were saying on the sidelines.” After coming out on top, Millsapps has developed more confidence, with her eye on being the last one standing at the state tournament in February. After Sharlyn Ramirez Castillo ran a variety of events during her first season at Riverdale Baptist, Coach Orlando Williams decided to have the Bowie transfer train primarily for the 800 meters ahead of her senior year. Williams still wanted to use Ramirez Castillo in multiple events and hoped the middle-distance training would help her in shorter races. It already has this season. Ramirez Castillo notched a personal best of 54.47 seconds in December at the JAMBAR Coaches Hall of Fame Invitational in New York in the 400-meter dash — a time that remains the best in the country this season and is an almost four-second improvement on her previous top time in the event. “She’s the type of athlete that can run from the 200 up to the 800,” Williams said. “She also does the 400-meter hurdles on outdoor. So she’s one of those multitalented kids that cross-trains to help build her endurance, her strength and also her focus.” Williams used a similar strategy with Stephanie Davis, who graduated from Riverdale in 2017 and won an NCAA title with South Carolina in the 4x400 relay in 2019. After Davis pulled her hamstring during her junior season as a short-distance sprinter, Williams had her train as an 800 runner and saw an improvement in her 400 times during her senior season. Ramirez Castillo already has made a similar leap with plenty of time left in her senior year. “The 800 now has become more of a sprint than a distance race,” Williams said. “I think the combination of sprint endurance and also endurance helps the kids to not only get stronger in their running but also endure their speed longer.” Adriano Arioti is committed to swim at Harvard, does not practice with his high school team and is set to compete in the U.S. Olympic trials in June in Indianapolis. The Georgetown Day senior has nothing left to prove at the prep level except to himself. Arioti doesn’t look like a typical swimmer out of the water, standing 5-foot-10 and 160 pounds. But he finds advantages at the margins, including his  “I really started to concentrate on the details now,” he said. Georgetown Day Coach Rick Bosland said Arioti is the most committed swimmer he has ever seen. Watching Arioti work is a privilege, Bosland said, and the coach mainly stays out of his way and lets him dominate at the meets Arioti can attend. Arioti won the 100- and 200-yard backstroke and the 100 and 200 butterfly at the Riley Eaton Holiday Invitational in Rockville on Dec. 14. Despite the feeling of constantly racing against himself, Arioti said he has come a long way in letting loose. “I try at every meet. I want to do my best, but high school is also where I have a lot of fun as well,” Arioti said. In a season that is centered on his performance in Indianapolis, the senior is trying to enjoy lasting moments at Georgetown Day. Once he gets to Cambridge, Mass., fun will be hard to come by. Arioti plans to study neuroscience. Coming off the   last winter, Walter Johnson is looking to build a system of success, not just a collection of talented players. With the departure of Malcolm Pharr, who led the Wildcats to their first championship in 18 years, Coach Jared Webb has implemented new types of training to appeal to varying skill levels on the team. There are “compete” practices, in which players go head-to-head to work on physicality and puck handling, and there are “systems” practices, which stress strategy and intelligence on the ice. Senior defenseman Jon Corwin said that balance of technical skill and playmaking prowess is becoming a weapon for the squad. “I think defensemen should 100 percent be some of the most physical players on the ice while also trying to be the smartest players on the ice, too,” Corwin said. “We’re able to recognize patterns, like where our teammates are going, what the other players are going to do. That’s really important. And then in those situations, when we do have to … battle it out with the other forwards, it’s important to lay a body and get in their head.” Corwin said it has been a gradual process to find a winning formula after the team lost much of its top line, but recent results speak for themselves. After losing to Whitman and tying Churchill early in the season, the Wildcats came out strong in a rematch against Churchill (also a rematch of the MSHL title game), winning, 5-2, before the holiday break. They notched another rematch win Friday, beating Whitman, 6-3. “Coming into the start of the season off a state championship win was definitely a little unfamiliar, and no one on the team has really done that before,” Corwin said. “But we’re pushing through it, and we’re really trying to rely on the systems our coach created for us. And it’s been working.” The day before the Lake Braddock gymnastics team received its state championship rings at halftime of a home basketball game, the Bruins faced one of their toughest tests of the regular season when they battled South County and Robinson on Thursday. Lake Braddock had won both of its meets and found its third victory of the season in a dominant display against stiff competition. The Bruins’ team score of 105.825 topped second-place Robinson’s 105.325 and third-place South County’s 98.975. Sophomore Sophie Bodner had the highest score on beam and the best all-around finish of the meet with marks of 9.375 and 26.975.  , last season’s  , competed on floor for the first time this season and posted a 9.45. Lake Braddock is chasing history. It could become the first VHSL squad to win three consecutive state championships since the 1990s. As the Bruins near another postseason in which they’ll again be favorites, Coach Mike Cooper is tasked with finalizing his starting lineup. Thursday’s win, in which the coach reached into his depth, served as an audition of sorts for gymnasts to prove they belong in that group. “I know who my top two or three are,” Cooper said. “I still have four, five and six I got to figure out.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4BPP6J3GRGBHMJVQAHQ5UDN2U.jpeg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4BPP6J3GRGBHMJVQAHQ5UDN2U.jpeg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4BPP6J3GRGBHMJVQAHQ5UDN2U.jpeg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4BPP6J3GRGBHMJVQAHQ5UDN2U.jpeg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4BPP6J3GRGBHMJVQAHQ5UDN2U.jpeg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C4BPP6J3GRGBHMJVQAHQ5UDN2U.jpeg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/09/her-wrestling-career-begins-14-0-middle-distance-suits-this-track-star/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 10:00:00,

NEW YORK — Elias Pettersson and Nils Hoglander each scored twice, Thatcher Demko made 39 saves and the Vancouver Canucks defeated the New York Rangers 6-3 on Monday night in battle of first-place teams. JT Miller and Brock Boeser also scored goals while Pettersson, Boeser and Filip Hronek had two assists apiece for Vancouver, which won for the third time in four games. After missing the playoffs for three straight seasons, the Canucks lead the Pacific Division with a 26-11-3 record. The Rangers lead the Metropolitan Division at 26-11-2. “We understand each other how we want to defend and forecheck. And that sets up your chances offensively,’’ said Pettersson, who led the Canucks with 102 points last season and has 52 points in 40 games this year. ”It’s great to see where we are in the standings.” Vincent Trocheck had two goals and Artemi Panarin also scored for the Rangers, who lost their second straight for just the second time this season. Alexis Lafreniere had two assists. The Rangers were coming off a 4-3 shootout loss at Montreal on Saturday. Their only previous consecutive losses were Dec. 5 and Dec. 9, when they fell on the road to Ottawa and Washington respectively. “They are a high-powered, high-octane team. The way we played, how we played mentally was just not sharp enough to be good for 60 minutes,’’ Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. Vancouver stopped the New Jersey Devils 6-4 on Saturday and will continue its New York-area tour against the Islanders on Tuesday. “That’s a tough team over there. To beat a team like we needed a lot of contributions from everybody, and I thought we got that tonight,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said. ”You have to give the guys credit ... The Rangers pressed and we made a couple of nice plays under pressure. That’s what I liked.” Trocheck opened the scoring on the power-play at 3:38 of the first, assisted by Mika Zibanejad and Panarin. The assist extended Panarin’s points streak to eight games. Miller tied the contest, firing his 19th goal past Igor Shesterkin at 4:31. Miller was a first-round draft pick in 2011 by the Rangers who was traded to Tampa Bay in 2018. He leads the Canucks with 54 points. “We’re going to the net and scoring goals. Right now, we are getting the bounces,’’ Miller said. ”This is a really special building for me to come into. I love playing here.” Hoglander put Vancouver ahead at 6:45, whipping the puck past Shesterkin from the right circle. Boeser made it 3-1 at 19:44 with his team-leading 25th goal with assists to Pettersson and Quinn Hughes as Shesterkin, 20 saves, allowed three goals on seven shots in the opening period. Panarin narrowed the deficit to 3-2 with his 26th goal at 8:19 of the second. Panarin has points in 33 of New York’s 39 games and leads the Rangers with 57 points. Petterson made it 4-2 with a dazzling move at 15:33 of the second before Hoglander scored his second of the game on a backhand at 16:47. Hronek assisted on both goals. “I tried to get the puck through my legs and get it to the net. That was a big goal for us,’’ Hoglander said. Trocheck scored his second at 3:36 of the third before Pettersson added an empty-net goal — his 19th of the season — at 18:29. “You’re not going to win when you give up five goals, not on a regular basis,’’ Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said. ”We made mental mistakes. We made line-change mistakes, we made turnover mistakes, and it was too much for our goaltender.” The Rangers won this season’s previous meeting against the Canucks, 4-3 in overtime on Oct. 28 in Vancouver.

Green, 33, has missed Golden State’s past 12 games after the   and is expected to undergo a brief ramp-up period before returning to the court. “Green completed steps that demonstrated his commitment to conforming his conduct to standards expected of NBA players,” the league said in a statement. “He has engaged in meetings with a counselor and has met jointly on multiple occasions with representatives of the NBA, the Warriors, and the National Basketball Players Association, both of which will continue throughout the season.” The NBA’s unusual decision to indefinitely suspend Green came less than a month after the four-time all-star completed a   for putting Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert in a headlock. At the time, NBA head of basketball operations Joe Dumars   that Green’s indefinite suspension “takes into account Green’s repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts.” The Warriors (17-18), who held the Western Conference’s final play-in tournament spot entering Saturday’s action, are eager for reinforcements following recent injuries to Chris Paul and Gary Payton II.   after suffering a fractured left hand during Friday’s win over the Detroit Pistons that will require him to undergo surgery next week. Golden State’s upcoming schedule includes home games against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday and the New Orleans Pelicans on Wednesday before it departs on a four-game trip with games at the Chicago Bulls (Friday), Milwaukee Bucks (Jan. 13), Memphis Grizzlies (Jan. 15) and Utah Jazz (Jan. 17). Green should provide a boost on both sides of the ball as an experienced facilitator and Golden State’s defensive anchor, but he will surely be under a microscope. Green’s blow to Nurkic’s head came as the two battled for position on an inbounds play. Nurkic held the right side of Green’s body in an attempt to prevent him from breaking open to receive a pass, and Green responded by spinning counterclockwise toward Nurkic and wildly swinging his right arm. Replays showed Green made direct contact with the left side of Nurkic’s face, causing the Bosnian big man to fall to the ground. “What’s going on with him? I don’t know,” Nurkic said of Green. “Personally, I feel like that brother needs help. I’m glad he didn’t try to choke me. At the same time, it ain’t nothing to do with basketball. I’m just out there trying to play basketball. He’s out there swinging. I think we saw that often. I hope whatever he’s got [going on] in his life, it gets better.” During a postgame news conference, Green apologized to Nurkic, said the blow was unintentional and acknowledged his ejection was “warranted.” “[Nurkic] was pulling my hip, and I was swinging away to sell the call and made contact with him,” Green said. “As you know, I’m not one to apologize for things I meant to do, but I do apologize to Jusuf because I didn’t intend to hit him. … A replay is never going to look good. I know my intentions. My intentions were to sell the call. I don’t think I’m an accurate enough puncher to do a full 360 and connect with someone. It’s unfortunate.” Green, who was also tossed from the Warriors’ 118-110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 11 for shoving Donovan Mitchell from behind during a transition play, is no stranger to league discipline. He was ejected from Game 2 and suspended for Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Sacramento Kings in April for  . As it did in its statement following the Gobert suspension, the NBA noted at the time that the suspension was “based in part on Green’s history of unsportsmanlike acts.” Perhaps most famously,   below the belt during the 2016 NBA Finals, prompting a one-game suspension that helped swing the series in favor of the Cavaliers. And in October 2022,   at practice. Poole was traded to the Washington Wizards in the offseason, one week before the Warriors signed Green to a four-year, $100 million contract extension.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTBNY4UKYJ3SFNQVXYCQGSWI7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTBNY4UKYJ3SFNQVXYCQGSWI7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTBNY4UKYJ3SFNQVXYCQGSWI7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTBNY4UKYJ3SFNQVXYCQGSWI7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTBNY4UKYJ3SFNQVXYCQGSWI7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DTBNY4UKYJ3SFNQVXYCQGSWI7Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/draymond-green-suspension-reinstated/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 19:14:00,

It’s still unclear how O’Connor died, but Tuesday’s coroner’s ruling excludes some of the most widely feared possibilities. André Rebello, secretary for the Coroners’ Society of England and Wales, explained that “all deaths by suicide are ‘unnatural.’ Most deaths from natural causes are not reported to any coroner but if a coroner found natural causes it would never be a suicide.” If someone dies of “natural causes,” this means that they did not die by suicide, or in an accident, or by a drug overdose, he said. Rebello stressed that he was talking generally, and not about any specific case. The Southwark Coroner’s Court said it had no further comments about O’Connor’s death.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7JHTIEOAYI6DJ4HN3HQAXLBCI&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7JHTIEOAYI6DJ4HN3HQAXLBCI&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7JHTIEOAYI6DJ4HN3HQAXLBCI&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7JHTIEOAYI6DJ4HN3HQAXLBCI&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7JHTIEOAYI6DJ4HN3HQAXLBCI&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V7JHTIEOAYI6DJ4HN3HQAXLBCI&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/09/sinead-oconnor-death-natural-causes-coroner/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 12:30:00,
"HOUSTON — The Michigan players took it all, including the seats. With the smell of cigar smoke wafting through the air, they toted folding chairs as they emerged from the locker room, eager to hop from one celebration to the next. They didn’t care whether all that padded College Football Playoff furniture could be packed with the rest of their equipment. The victors needed to hoard loot. HOUSTON — The Michigan players took it all, including the seats. With the smell of cigar smoke wafting through the air, they toted folding chairs as they emerged from the locker room, eager to hop from one celebration to the next. They didn’t care whether all that padded College Football Playoff furniture could be packed with the rest of their equipment. The victors needed to hoard loot. “Took on all comers,” Coach Jim Harbaugh said Monday, a little before midnight. “Last one standing.” If this season was truly Michigan vs. Everybody, we have a final result. Michigan dominated. Everybody, from the worthy challengers to the anonymous whistleblowers to the public-opinion judges sentencing them to cheater prison, lost. The last of Everybody toppled in the College Football Playoff title game after Washington, owner of the most stylish offense in the sport, succumbed to the physicality and defensive brilliance of the Wolverines. In an impressive  , Michigan left no doubt to conclude a season smothered in doubt. For the first time since the 1997 season, the Wolverines claimed a national title. While they can’t escape the memory of the   scheme that   organized, it would be dishonest to completely discredit their greatness. Yes, they’re involved in a messy, integrity-piercing fiasco that remains under NCAA investigation. And, yes, they’re the class of the 2023 season despite the slimy footnote. They’re not as “innocent” as Harbaugh proclaimed after the game. And they’re not as irredeemably guilty as the arbiters of righteousness keep screaming. Michigan is a chameleon, an all-of-the-above answer to every question. But you still have to crown the Wolverines. Their defense, formidable at every level, was a spectacular next act to the scary units that lifted Georgia to  . For all the complaints about the illegitimacy of their success, their roster development tells a charming college story. Like Washington’s, Michigan’s unbeaten journey to the title game wasn’t the result of monster high school recruiting classes fulfilling the destiny of can’t-miss prospects. These stars grew over time, sacrificed for one another and embraced the heartbreaking process of becoming a champion. In 2015, Harbaugh inherited a 5-7 team and a program that had lost itself during the failed coaching tenures of Brady Hoke and Rich Rodriguez. It took him nine seasons to summit college football. It took until 2021 for Michigan to qualify for the College Football Playoff, but the Wolverines couldn’t break through the past two seasons in semifinals against Georgia and TCU. Disappointment drove them to get better. They wouldn’t have finished 15-0 without the scar tissue. The players wouldn’t have been able to handle the controversy heaped on them by irresponsible adults without the motivation to finish the job. “We came a long way, but in order to accomplish things like this, you’ve got to go to those dark places where everything’s not great,” quarterback J.J. McCarthy said. “And just the response, the urgency right after that last game last year, it was different. I knew it. Just from being on the podium last year and saying we would be back. I knew the guys that were coming back. I had this feeling that it was going to be where we are right now.” When he took the stage for a postgame interview, McCarthy pretended to crown Harbaugh. The coach now has a trophy to solidify his status as both an elite program builder and a finisher. His father, Jack, won a national title at Western Kentucky in 2002. His brother, John, led the Baltimore Ravens over Jim’s San Francisco 49ers 11 years ago in Super Bowl XLVII. Now, the little brother has become the third Harbaugh this century to celebrate being the last team standing. “For me personally, I can now sit at the big person’s table in the family,” Harbaugh said. “They won’t keep me over there on the little table anymore. It’s good to be at the big person’s table from now on.” Of course, with the Ravens entering   with the league’s best record, John could win a second Super Bowl in about a month. Even if Jim took one of those souvenir chairs, his big-table seat might not be the cushiest. Perhaps he’s willing to unplug his competitiveness and ambition for a few days now. It won’t last long with Harbaugh expected to flirt with NFL suitors. Again. But Monday night, he was as content as he will ever be. “I just want to enjoy this,” said Harbaugh, who served two three-game suspensions this season. “I just want to enjoy this. I hope you give me that. Can a guy have that? Does it always have to be what’s next, what’s the future?” The Wolverines are a team worth stopping time for. They put on a clinic against Washington, taking apart Michael Penix Jr. and the Huskies’ offense and rushing for 303 yards.  , three-quarters of those yards came before contact. To open the game, Donovan Edwards darted through massive holes for touchdowns of 41 and 46 yards. He finished with 104 yards. Blake Corum ran for 134, including a 59-yard dash. The first eight times that Michigan running backs carried the ball, they gained 178 yards. That’s 22.3 yards per carry. A dry-cleaning service couldn’t have kept those Michigan jerseys looking fresher than Washington’s confused defense. With the lead, Michigan could play its game. It didn’t need to take unnecessary risks on offense. On defense, coordinator Jesse Minter watched the players execute a smart plan to pressure Penix while slowing down his processing and restricting his audacity in throwing down the field. Penix couldn’t create big plays early, and when a few were available, he uncharacteristically missed. He completed only 27 of 51 passes and threw for 255 yards, pedestrian numbers by his standards. He threw two interceptions and failed to guide the Huskies through three drives in which they could’ve tied a 20-13 game. “That was a spectacular game by our defense,” Harbaugh said. He must live up to a promise now. The coach vowed to get his first tattoo if Michigan won. His detractors would probably love to design it, but he has a plan. Sort of. He knows he wants 15-0 written in ink. And a classic Michigan block “M” in maize and blue to signify the Wolverines surpassing 1,000 victories. “I’m going to put it on my shoulder,” Harbaugh said. By the time he quells his imagination, he’ll probably have an arm sleeve. Harbaugh is a champion. Michigan sits atop the sport, having beaten Penn State, Maryland, Ohio State, Iowa, Alabama and Washington to finish the season, all victories that came after the sign-stealing revelation. How will we remember this team? It’s complicated. It’s also wasted energy. “We said we had unfinished business, so I’ll leave you all with this,” Corum declared during the trophy presentation. “The business is finished.” The best team won. The best team won while facing past cheating allegations. Both facts are on Michigan’s 2023 record. Only one will be immortalized on a banner.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PT72KMZWWBDBYYU5GVZ33H57I_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PT72KMZWWBDBYYU5GVZ33H57I_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PT72KMZWWBDBYYU5GVZ33H57I_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PT72KMZWWBDBYYU5GVZ33H57I_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PT72KMZWWBDBYYU5GVZ33H57I_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5PT72KMZWWBDBYYU5GVZ33H57I_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/09/michigan-football-title/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 07:05:00,
"The Washington Commanders wasted no time starting anew. On Monday morning, a day after his team   to finish the season 4-13, Commanders owner Josh Harris fired coach Ron Rivera and announced he had enlisted former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers and former Minnesota Vikings GM Rick Spielman to advise in searches for a new head of football operations and coach. The Washington Commanders wasted no time starting anew. On Monday morning, a day after his team   to finish the season 4-13, Commanders owner Josh Harris fired coach Ron Rivera and announced he had enlisted former Golden State Warriors general manager Bob Myers and former Minnesota Vikings GM Rick Spielman to advise in searches for a new head of football operations and coach. The moves end   and begin a series of changes that will overhaul the franchise in Harris’s vision. “It’s important that I do this personally and get this right and then we bring in the right leadership,” Harris said. Shortly after Washington announced Rivera’s exit, it submitted a flurry of requests to other NFL teams for permission to interview at least eight   and  , with more likely to follow. Commanders GM Martin Mayhew and executive vice president of football/player personnel Marty Hurney will stay on through the search processes — both are under contract for another year — but the team didn’t make promises beyond that. Harris said he plans to run a “thorough but rapid” search, with the hope of having the top executive in place soon so that person can have input in hiring the coach and the rest of the front office. Teams can begin to hold virtual and in-person interviews for primary executive roles, but they must wait until after the divisional round of the playoffs to speak with coaching candidates in person. They can talk virtually before then. Rivera was both the coach and the top football executive, but Harris envisions the roles as separate jobs. “My desire is to have the head of football operations in place and then to listen very hard to what that person wants to do,” Harris said. “... I want to get the best talent here and then hold them accountable and work with them. So what that person wants to do or not do is really important in our search process.” Harris’s search team will include Myers, Spielman and Commanders limited partners Mitchell Rales, Magic Johnson and David Blitzer. Myers, an NBA analyst for ESPN, was an executive with the Warriors for 12 seasons (2011 to 2023) and helped the team win four NBA championships. He was named the league’s executive of the year twice for his decisions, which included the hiring of Coach Steve Kerr. He also spent 14 years as a sports agent. “He knows how to identify talent; he knows how to build winning franchises, winning cultures,” Harris said. “... He’s not been around football, but he’s an amazing sports executive, and I’m really happy to have him helping. He’ll be around as an adviser to me.” Spielman spent more than three decades in NFL personnel. Harris said Spielman would work with the team through the hiring process and he was “not sure” about his role after that. The group’s interview requests Monday included several executives (San Francisco 49ers assistant GM Adam Peters, Chicago Bears assistant GM Ian Cunningham, Cleveland Browns assistant GM Glenn Cook, Philadelphia Eagles assistant GM Alec Halaby and Kansas City Chiefs assistant GM Mike Borgonzi) and coaches (Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, Houston Texans offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik and Baltimore Ravens assistant head coach/defensive line coach Anthony Weaver), according to multiple people with knowledge of the requests. Harris is no stranger to sports rebuilds, having   and the NHL’s New Jersey Devils in recent years. And though football operations are the priority, he could also alter the business side this year. He is expected to continue to improve   as the team  . “There’s a lot of ingredients here for success,” Harris said. “... We will recruit amazing individuals on the coaching side and on the front-office side. But I’m pretty optimistic that we’re going to be able to move the ball here very quickly.” Former Washington owner Daniel Snyder   four years ago. Rivera had spent the previous nine seasons coaching the Carolina Panthers and was widely respected as a coach and leader, and the chance to control Washington’s football operations was a selling point. So, too, was the chance to fix the team’s culture. Rivera soon became the primary voice for the team as it navigated two name   of its workplace and operations and probes by three attorneys general. “That was a lot,” Rivera said last week. “A lot more than I had anticipated there.” In 2020, his first season in Washington, Rivera was   and underwent chemotherapy and proton radiation while continuing to coach. He didn’t miss a game. In 2021, the Drug Enforcement Administration   the team’s headquarters as part of an investigation of the head athletic trainer,  , for illegally providing controlled substances to players. In 2022, rookie running back Brian Robinson Jr. was   twice during an attempted robbery in D.C. just before the start of the season. Just a few months later, Snyder announced his intent to   of the team, setting in motion the process that led to Harris’s  . “[I] was trying to keep the focus on the players,” Rivera said. “... This is a player’s game. You don’t have the players, you don’t get the players doing the things that they’re capable of, you’re going to struggle. And that’s, I think, part of what we’ve had to deal with.” Rivera’s ability to   was no small feat, and players often said it was among his greatest strengths. On the field, the Commanders went 26-40-1 over Rivera’s four years, winning their division once and finishing last twice. They churned through eight starting quarterbacks, and only one player (defensive end Chase Young) the team drafted or signed during Rivera’s tenure earned a Pro Bowl nod or an all-pro selection. Harris’s purchase of the team in July incited   to training camp practices. But a 2-0 start quickly spiraled, thanks to a leaky defense and stagnant offense. Quarterback Sam Howell, who impressed early in the season, struggled in the second half. Though the season fell apart quickly, Harris didn’t believe an in-season coaching change would produce the results the team wanted. Shortly after he was fired, Rivera issued a lengthy statement thanking the team’s fans and new owners and lauding the players for their “professionalism, toughness, work ethic and dedication to the game.” “I believe we began to change the culture of this organization in meaningful ways,” he said. Rivera addressed his players one last time Monday morning to thank them and share his appreciation of their efforts. Then Harris spoke to the group and told them the onus was on him to make the right decisions. “It’s very important to be having a dialogue with the players, listening to some of the leadership, listening to how they feel about things,” Harris said. For the first time in decades, Washington may be regarded as   for prospective coaches and executives — if not the top landing spot. The team needs a full rebuild, but it is projected to have the most salary cap space in the NFL in 2024 and will have five draft picks in the first three rounds, including the No. 2 selection. More significant: It has an ownership group willing to spend on and delegate to top talent. “It’s hard to win four games,” Harris said. “From my point of view, we are coming out of this poised for a great future.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJWCMSAVTTY25P3OBXHFOMVQ2E.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJWCMSAVTTY25P3OBXHFOMVQ2E.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJWCMSAVTTY25P3OBXHFOMVQ2E.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJWCMSAVTTY25P3OBXHFOMVQ2E.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJWCMSAVTTY25P3OBXHFOMVQ2E.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MJWCMSAVTTY25P3OBXHFOMVQ2E.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/ron-rivera-fired-commanders/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 16:25:00,
"WAUKEE, Iowa —   surveyed the beer and burger joint. “Do we have any Iowans here?” the Republican presidential candidate asked dubiously. He hesitated, knowing there weren’t many. Most of those staring back were students visiting from Duke University, attending Iowa caucus campaign events hosted by several candidates to learn more about the state’s democratic tradition. WAUKEE, Iowa —   surveyed the beer and burger joint. “Do we have any Iowans here?” the Republican presidential candidate asked dubiously. He hesitated, knowing there weren’t many. Most of those staring back were students visiting from Duke University, attending Iowa caucus campaign events hosted by several candidates to learn more about the state’s democratic tradition. One woman couldn’t quite figure out who he was. “Was he a state trooper?” wondered Debbie White, who was visiting Iowa and had heard snippets of Hutchinson’s speech on fentanyl and immigration. Canvassing earlier in the day also gave rise to some confusion. “I knocked on a door today, and they said they loved me,” Hutchinson said in an interview. “And they said, ‘Who are you going support?’ and I said, ‘I’m still running.’ ” There are long shots, longer shots, and then there is Hutchinson, a former two-term Arkansas governor turned 2024 footnote. Months after better-polling, better-funded candidates such as Sen.   (R-S.C.) and former vice president   concluded they had no path in a race dominated by former president   and ended their campaigns, Hutchinson is still running. “Asa is not going to do well in the caucus,” John Hughes, a Republican who formerly lived in Arkansas but retired in Iowa, told The Washington Post. “But I’m going to vote for him because I like him, I like what he says, and I know he’s a good guy.” Hughes was the sole Iowan at the event who told The Post that he planned to caucus for the governor, eagerly raising his hand when Hutchinson queried the crowd for residents of this state. In a pre-Donald Trump era, Hutchinson  might have fared far better. He has the résumé of conservative accomplishments and executive experience that would have likely made him a serious contender for the nomination. First appointed the youngest federal prosecutor in the country by  , Hutchinson became a conservative fixture in once-blue Arkansas, serving three terms in Congress. Under President George W. Bush, he headed the Drug Enforcement Administration and went on to the Department of Homeland Security, overseeing the creation of  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. When he ran for his second and last term as the state’s governor, he won more votes than any previous Arkansas governor. But Trump has reshaped the Republican Party, and Hutchinson trails well behind him and the rest of the pack. The former governor has under 1 percent support, according to some polling averages. Yet he is adamant that there’s still a place for him in this contest. Hutchinson said he intends to stay in the race through the caucuses because he believes he can return normalcy to the country and party. He said he would reevaluate depending on whether he exceeds his expectations, but he declined to define what that threshold would be. At his event the day after the third anniversary of the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, he sharply criticized Trump, suggesting that the mob was unpatriotic and that Trump was wrong to glorify the violent day. Hutchinson, dressed in a dark brown sweater and navy trousers, appeared to mostly casually chat with the students about their experiences in Iowa. Students later remarked how different the event felt compared to others, with one equating it to a campaign event that a school board candidate might host. The former red-state governor has gone to 30 cities in Iowa over the past two weeks, traveling on a shoestring budget. He has encountered questions about his campaign’s viability, and people who don’t recognize him. “Hi, I’m Asa Hutchinson,” he said to a couple eating dinner in a booth at the restaurant. “Oh yeah,” responded the man, who paused eating his buffalo chicken wings and appeared confused as to why a presidential candidate stood before him. Jon, who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used for privacy reasons, later told The Post he didn’t know much about Hutchinson other than that he was  . Jon and his wife Teresa said they didn’t plan to caucus, but if they did, they might support Gov.   because they have a second home on the west coast of Florida and appreciated his handling of Hurricane Ian. (They did not stay to hear Hutchinson speak.) Although Hutchinson tried to engage with another Iowan family at the neighboring booth, diners mostly looked on. Of the handful of Iowans dining inside, nearly no one there planned to support him in the caucuses. One man sitting near the bar, Mike Eckerd, said he was undecided but had not ruled out Hutchinson. A mother and daughter at the event, who declined to share their names, said they did not intend to support Hutchinson because they didn’t believe his candidacy was viable; the daughter had picked former U.N. ambassador   and the mother was trying to decide between Haley and DeSantis. The Duke students, who have attended events for every major candidate, listened attentively to Hutchinson speak, and they said they appreciated his care and time answering their questions on Israel, transgender rights, student loans and more. But as they boarded their bus after the event, they reflected on how the man who had shaken their hands, posed for selfies with them and talked with them about politics, had virtually no chance of becoming president. While they said they thought he had a kind disposition and that his answers reflected old-school conservative values, they agreed he was not someone Republicans would support — and they wouldn’t vote for him, either. “He’s unfortunately not extreme enough for the Republican Party,” said 18-year-old Amaia Clayton, who is a registered Democrat and plans to vote for Biden but said she preferred Haley among the Republicans. “He felt like a Republican of the past. He felt like his policies seemed realistic, even if I didn’t fully agree with them. But we knew he wasn’t going to win. He’s just normal.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CC25JC65D66YJRHVFJD5QPE7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CC25JC65D66YJRHVFJD5QPE7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CC25JC65D66YJRHVFJD5QPE7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CC25JC65D66YJRHVFJD5QPE7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CC25JC65D66YJRHVFJD5QPE7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5CC25JC65D66YJRHVFJD5QPE7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/asa-hutchinson-campaign-iowa-2024/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 14:05:00,
"New Orleans’s win over Atlanta earlier in the day meant the Commanders could secure the No. 2 pick in April’s draft with a loss to the Cowboys. For about a quarter, Washington looked like a team that was more interested in spoiling Dallas’s division title hopes than getting on with its offseason, but then the Comanders reminded everyone why they had entered the game with their longest losing streak since 2013. After an eighth consecutive loss left him 26-40-1 in four years in Washington, lame duck Coach Ron Rivera was asked whether the organization should draft a quarterback with the second pick.

For about a quarter, Washington looked like a team that was more interested in spoiling Dallas’s division title hopes than getting on with its offseason, but then the Comanders reminded everyone why they had entered the game with their longest losing streak since 2013. After an eighth consecutive loss left him 26-40-1 in four years in Washington, lame duck Coach Ron Rivera was asked whether the organization should draft a quarterback with the second pick. “I think the organization has to do what they believe is best for the organization,”  . “I really, truly believe that’s what’s going to happen. They’ll make the best decision going forward.” The Commanders  . With nothing to lose, Washington went for it on fourth down twice on its opening possession and called multiple trick plays in the first half, including a wide receiver pass to quarterback Sam Howell. Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy’s creative play-calling produced only 180 yards of offense, the Commanders’ second-lowest output of the Rivera era, ahead of only a   in a rainy 2020 loss to the Rams. Washington’s 32nd-ranked defense allowed touchdowns on four consecutive possessions in the second and third quarters, which turned a Commanders lead into a Dallas rout. Washington allowed at least 400 yards for the ninth time this season, the most in franchise history. Trailing by 28 points with 1:06 remaining, Howell and the Commanders’ offense took the field for the last time with one thing on their minds: getting McLaurin his franchise-record fourth consecutive season of at least 1,000 receiving yards. McLaurin, who entered the game needing 54 yards to reach the mark, was stuck on 41. Tight end John Bates made a key block on Howell’s ensuing screen pass to McLaurin, which, coupled with some determined running after the catch, resulted in a 15-yard gain. “Literally everybody on the sideline was like, ‘We’re going to get this for you,'” McLaurin said afterward. “'We’re going to block our a-- off for you, and it kind of made me a little emotional. It’s a testament to the guys we have in this locker room, and I think it’s a testament how they hopefully feel about me and the leader that I’ve tried to be for them.” A major factor in Rivera’s lack of success in Washington was the organization’s   under his watch. Forbes, who was benched for his poor performance earlier this season, capped a disappointing rookie year with another dreadful game. The cornerback looked lost trying to cover wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the Cowboys’ first touchdown and whiffed on an attempted tackle on tight end Jake Ferguson later in the first half.

In a beautiful moment of unity, an “Eagles suck!” chant broke out among the Commanders and Cowboys fans at FedEx Field when out of town scores were displayed on the scoreboard during the third quarter. The defending NFC champion Eagles were losing 24-0 to the Giants and headed for their fifth loss in their last six games.

PAUL, Minn. — Matt Murray stopped 23 shots for his first career NHL shutout, and Dallas scored two short-handed goals to snap a three-game losing streak with a 4-0 win at Minnesota on Monday night. Murray earned his second NHL victory in his fourth career game. The undrafted 25-year-old from Alberta played five years of college hockey at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, winning a national championship in 2021. “Obviously, playing in the NHL is one thing; it’s every kids dream, but to be able to get a shutout is on a level of its own,” Murray said. “I’m ecstatic.” Tyler Seguin and Roope Hintz each had a goal and an assist for Dallas. “Spectacular,” Seguin said of Murray. “I’m sure he’s been dreaming about a moment like this his whole life.” The Stars’ fourth-best in the NHL penalty kill (85.7%) was perfect on six Wild power-play opportunities. Including an 8-3 victory on Nov. 12, Dallas (23-11-5) has scored nine special-teams goals in two contests against Minnesota (17-18-4) this season. Marc-Andre Fleury made 16 saves but missed in his first chance to pass Patrick Roy for sole possession of second place on the NHL’s career wins list. Fleury had   Saturday at Columbus. With the Wild on the power play, Hintz one-timed a no-look, backhanded pass from Seguin past Fleury at 10:44 mark of the first period. Hintz has 14 points in his last nine games against Minnesota and leads the Stars with 16 goals. Radek Faksa added a second short-handed goal 8:22 into the third. It was Dallas’ ninth short-handed goal of the season, tied for second in the league. Jason Robertson added the final goal. After Hintz’s score, the Stars killed Minnesota’s 47-second, 5-on-3 advantage and emerged from the first leading 1-0 despite being outshot 13-4. “I think we needed a good goaltending performance on the road,” Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. “We lost a couple, and this is always a tough building to play in. Really, the first period was the game. (The Wild) came out really hard. ... I thought they could have had two or three if (Murray) wasn’t ready to play. He was our best player by far in the first period.” Early in the third, Seguin’s wrist shot from the right point snuck under Fleury’s right arm pit and was initially ruled a no-goal. But the video goal judge overturned the call, and it was 2-0 just 1:28 into the final period. Injury-plagued Minnesota did get Marcus Foligno back after a two-game absence. Goalie Filip Gustavsson, defensemen Jonas Brodin and Jared Spurgeon, and forwards Kirill Kaprizov and Vinni Lettieri all remained unavailable Monday. “I don’t think it was an effort issue ... I think we’re ready to play,” Wild coach John Hynes said. “You’ve got to play hard, but you can only get so far when you play hard; you’ve got to play smart, too.” UP NEXT Stars: Host Minnesota on Wednesday night.

"Michigan closed out the 2023-24 college football season with Monday night’s   over Washington in the College Football Playoff championship game. While the game’s middle section was competitive, the Wolverines controlled the start and finish, and as a result, it was the seventh CFP final out of 10 to be decided by double digits. Michigan closed out the 2023-24 college football season with Monday night’s   over Washington in the College Football Playoff championship game. While the game’s middle section was competitive, the Wolverines controlled the start and finish, and as a result, it was the seventh CFP final out of 10 to be decided by double digits. With the playoff expanding to 12 teams next season, here’s a look at where Monday night’s contest ranks among the other CFP championship games. With the Tigers down 24-14 entering the fourth quarter, quarterback DeShaun Watson led Clemson on two long scoring drives to take a 28-24 lead. But Alabama answered with Jalen Hurts’s 30-yard touchdown run, setting up the most dramatic final drive in CFP history: a nine-play, 68-yard march that ended on Watson’s two-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Hunter Renfrow with one second remaining. Watson finished with 420 passing yards despite taking numerous big hits, with 58 of those yards coming on that final madcap drive in the most memorable CFP final of them all. The Bulldogs led 13-0 at halftime and 20-10 after three quarters, but the Crimson Tide used a pair of eight-play scoring drives in the fourth quarter to pull even at 20 and then had a chance to win at the end of regulation, only for Andy Pappanastos to miss a 36-yard field goal attempt. Georgia went backward on its one possession of overtime, losing nine yards and settling for Rodrigo Blankenship’s 51-yard field goal. That set the stage for Tua Tagovailoa’s 41-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on second and 26, giving Alabama an improbable walk-off win in the only CFP championship game that went to overtime. Crimson Tide Coach Nick Saban reached into his bag of tricks early in the fourth quarter, calling for an onside kick after an Alabama field goal had tied the score at 24. The “pop kick” caught Clemson by surprise, and two plays later, Crimson Tide quarterback Jake Coker found tight end O.J. Howard for a 51-yard touchdown pass that gave Alabama a lead it would not lose in a wild fourth quarter that featured 40 points. After Clemson got within five points on a touchdown with 12 seconds left, its own onside kick attempt scooted out of bounds, and Alabama could finally exhale. Howard had a monster game — five catches, 208 yards, two touchdowns — while the Crimson Tide’s Kenyan Drake added further excitement with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. For three quarters, we observed the rarest of CFP specimens: a rock fight. Of the game’s first seven scores, six were field goals, and the SEC foes combined for eight punts and five three-and-outs over the first 45 minutes of game time. But after Alabama broke through to take an 18-13 lead early in the fourth quarter on a Bryce Young touchdown pass to Cameron Latu, the Bulldogs produced perhaps the most memorable 10 minutes in program history. First, Adonai Mitchell wrestled the ball away from Alabama’s Khyree Jackson on a 40-yard touchdown catch from Stetson Bennett. Then, after forcing a three-and-out, Bennett and Brock Bowers hooked up on a 15-yard touchdown pass to give the Bulldogs the lead, and Kelee Ringo’s 79-yard pick-six on the ensuing drive sealed the deal with 54 seconds left. The Wolverines seemed poised to run the Huskies out of the stadium after they averaged a gaudy 17.3 yards per play in the first quarter and took a 14-3 lead. But Washington’s defense stiffened, and for the next two quarters the game was more or less a stalemate. In the fourth, however, Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy’s 41-yard pass to Colston Loveland set up Blake Corum’s 12-yard touchdown run, and Mike Sainristil’s interception of Michael Penix Jr. on the next possession laid the foundation for the final points and Michigan’s first national championship since 1997. The first CFP championship was a one-point game a little more than halfway through the third quarter and was still a one-score game at the start of the fourth, but Ezekiel Elliott’s two fourth-quarter touchdown runs padded Ohio State’s lead and gave the Buckeyes their first national title in 12 years. Elliott pummeled the Ducks for 246 yards and four touchdowns, helping Ohio State overcome three lost fumbles. Oregon quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota threw for 333 yards and two scores, but the Ducks were plagued by dropped passes at key times and too often settled for field goals after long drives into Buckeyes territory. Playing just down the road in New Orleans, LSU turned a 17-7 second-quarter deficit into a 28-17 halftime lead and was clinging to a three-point advantage in the third quarter when quarterback Joe Burrow found Thaddeus Moss on a four-yard touchdown pass. Another Burrow touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter — his fifth of the night to go along with 463 passing yards — closed the scoring, and LSU had its first national title in 11 years. The game featured a combined 1,027 yards (631 of them from LSU) and only one turnover. After five tries, the No. 1 seed finally won it all. This one was competitively entertaining for a quarter and change, with Clemson opening the scoring with a pick-six and Alabama immediately answering with a long touchdown pass, all within the game’s first three minutes. The Crimson Tide, a 5.5-point favorite, actually led, 16-14, after opening the second quarter with a field goal. But the Tigers turned on the jets after that, scoring 30 unanswered points and rendering the result a foregone conclusion by the time quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw his third touchdown pass near the end of the third quarter. Before an abbreviated pandemic crowd of 14,926 in South Florida, Crimson Tide wide receiver DeVonta Smith confirmed his Heisman worthiness with 12 catches for 215 yards and three touchdowns despite not playing in the second half because of a dislocated finger. As for the game itself, a 14-14 second-quarter tie became a 35-17 Alabama lead at halftime, and Coach Nick Saban won his sixth national title in 12 seasons and seventh overall after a second half that did not feature much drama. After a pair of highly entertaining semifinal games that were decided by a combined seven points, the 2023 championship contest was the biggest dud of them all thanks to the Bulldogs’ sheer dominance of the overmatched Horned Frogs. Georgia advanced down the field seemingly at will, averaging 8.2 yards every time it snapped the ball, while holding TCU to a season-low 188 yards. This one was all but over before halftime after the Bulldogs scored three times over the final 8:30 of the first half, taking a 38-7 lead into the break and cruising to its second straight national title from there.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLOB6QD4IXTRGV6ZKBML2PCNAY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLOB6QD4IXTRGV6ZKBML2PCNAY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLOB6QD4IXTRGV6ZKBML2PCNAY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLOB6QD4IXTRGV6ZKBML2PCNAY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLOB6QD4IXTRGV6ZKBML2PCNAY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VLOB6QD4IXTRGV6ZKBML2PCNAY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/09/college-football-playoff-championship-games-ranked/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 12:21:00,

Franz Beckenbauer, who led the West German national team to World Cup championships as player and coach and whose on-field presence was so dominant that he was nicknamed “Der Kaiser,” died Jan. 7 at 78. His family announced his death in a statement to German news agencies, without providing further details. He reportedly had Parkinson’s disease, heart ailments and dementia. Mr. Beckenbauer, one of the greatest European soccer players of all time, spent most of his professional career in his native Munich, propelling the once-second-tier Bayern Munich club to international prominence. He played in three World Cups and served as captain of the West German national team that won the international crown in 1974. Despite having no experience, he became the head coach, or manager, of the national team in 1984, leading it to a second-place finish at the 1986 World Cup and to the championship four years later. He joined Brazil’s   — whose death was announced last week — and Didier Deschamps of France as the only men to hoist the World Cup trophy as player and coach. Mr. Beckenbauer began his career as a forward, a player who is a constant threat to score. He later moved to back line as a defender, where he helped reshape the role of the sweeper (sometimes called  ), who is the last line of defense before the goalkeeper. He often covered, or marked, an opposing team’s top scorer and moved from one side of the field to the other, intercepting passes or stealing the ball with a deft flick of his foot. He was rarely faked out of position.  , the renowned Brazilian player who was Mr. Beckenbauer’s teammate with the New York Cosmos in the twilight of their careers, called him “one of the best I ever saw play.” Mr. Beckenbauer, who became captain of the Bayern Munich team in his early 20s, was a formidable player with exceptional vision of the field and an intuitive understanding of how a play would develop. He transformed his defensive position of sweeper, adding an element of excitement as he became a potent offensive force in his own right. (In that respect, he was similar to the Boston Bruins’s Bobby Orr, who was redefining the role of the hockey defenseman at the same time.) “I was pretty much the first to interpret the position offensively, as an attacker, and not only stay back and play as a sweeper, as was usual then,” Mr. Beckenbauer said in a 2006 interview with FIFA, the international soccer organization. “Maybe that was just my game,” he continued. “By nature I was more of an attacking player than a defensive one. That’s why I always pushed forward.” Mr. Beckenbauer, at 5-foot-11 and 170 pounds, was not exceptionally large but had the ability to dominate the game without being a major goal scorer. He was deceptively fast and played with an unhurried elegance, always appearing to be three steps ahead of everyone else on the pitch. He was an   who could anticipate the moves of his teammates and opponents. Controlling the ball from the back, he often sent a pass through a phalanx of defenders, catching a teammate on the toe 40 yards downfield. “Every pass of his has eyes and finds his teammates, everywhere,” another Cosmos teammate, Vladislav Bogićević, once said. Before his 21st birthday, Mr. Beckenbauer was already a star for the West German team, scoring a goal in a 2-1 victory over Sweden to secure his country’s place in the 1966 World Cup. He scored four goals during the World Cup tournament to lead West Germany to the final game against England. He closely covered England’s top player,  , but England prevailed on its home turf, 4-2. Four years later in Mexico, Mr. Beckenbauer helped avenge his country’s loss to England, scoring a goal in a 3-2 victory. In a 4-3 semifinal loss to Italy, Mr. Beckenbauer claimed a valiant place in soccer lore when he suffered a dislocated right shoulder during the game. Because West Germany had used its allotted substitutions, he stayed on the field, playing the rest of the game with his arm strapped to his chest. In a preliminary game before the 1974 World Cup, West Germany lost to its cross-border communist rival, East Germany, creating waves of alarm among the team’s followers. As team captain, Mr. Beckenbauer approached the coach, Helmut Schön, asking him to revamp the lineup by using younger players. The re-energized squad swept through the World Cup, winning the final game over the Netherlands, 2-1, in Munich. The victory made Mr. Beckenbauer and his teammate  , who scored the winning goal, national heroes. In club play, Mr. Beckenbauer led Bayern Munich to three straight European championships from 1974 through 1976. He twice won the  , or the golden ball award, as the most valuable player in Europe. In 1977, he departed for New York after being offered a four-year contract for $2.5 million to join Pelé on the Cosmos. The aging stars won three North American Soccer League championships before Mr. Beckenbauer returned in 1980 to Germany, where he helped his new team, Hamburg SV, win the championship of the German professional league, or Bundesliga. After a final season with the Cosmos, he retired as a player in 1983. He then turned to coaching, taking West Germany to the World Cup final in 1986, only to lose to   dynamic team from Argentina. In the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mr. Beckenbauer guided the West German team to the 1990 World Cup in Italy — the last time there were separate squads before reunification of the two German states. In a World Cup final rematch with Argentina, West Germany triumphed, 1-0. Mr. Beckenbauer said victory as a coach tasted even sweeter than as a player. Franz Anton Beckenbauer was born Sept. 11, 1945, in Munich. His father was a postal official, and his mother tended the home in the working-class neighborhood of Giesing. He was obsessed with soccer from an early age and, against his father’s wishes, joined his first team at 9. “You are not born to become a world star in Giesing,” Mr. Beckenbauer said in 2010. “Football for me was a deliverance.” He joined a Bayern Munich youth team at 14 but secretly hoped to play for 1860 Munich, then the city’s leading club. But when a player from the 1860 youth team slapped him across the face during a game, Mr. Beckenbauer determined he would stay with Bayern and someday make it Munich’s preeminent team. He joined the top Bayern club in 1964 and, within five years, led it to the German Bundesliga crown. By then, he was already dubbed “Der Kaiser” and, by some, “Emperor Franz.” Mr. Beckenbauer coached Bayern Munich in the 1990s, winning the European title in 1996. He later became an official with the club and FIFA and successfully led efforts to secure the 2006 World Cup for Germany. His actions came under scrutiny during a probe of corruption among FIFA officials, and he was suspended from the organization for 90 days in 2014. He was investigated, along with others, for possible involvement in a bribery scheme involving FIFA’s selection of Russia and Qatar as the World Cup sites for 2018 and 2022, but no charges were brought. Mr. Beckenbauer was married three times, most recently to Heidi Burmeister in 2006. He had five children from his marriages and other relationships. A son, professional soccer player Stephan Beckenbauer, died in 2015 of a brain tumor. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available. Beginning as a child, Mr. Beckenbauer collected pictures of faraway lands. Throughout his life, he traveled the world, always curious to see new places. When he was being wooed by New York Cosmos in 1977, he was given a helicopter ride from Manhattan to the Giants Stadium in New Jersey, where the team played. “That was then the most modern stadium in the world,” he told a German newspaper in 2010, “with VIP boxes. We didn’t have that in Europe. As we flew over the stadium, I told them, ‘Fine, stop it, I am coming.’”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FK37VIVW5DBB3KGKEEI73PSQUI.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FK37VIVW5DBB3KGKEEI73PSQUI.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FK37VIVW5DBB3KGKEEI73PSQUI.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FK37VIVW5DBB3KGKEEI73PSQUI.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FK37VIVW5DBB3KGKEEI73PSQUI.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FK37VIVW5DBB3KGKEEI73PSQUI.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/08/franz-beckenbauer-germany-soccer-world-cup-dead/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 21:05:00,

Multiple investigations and probes by three attorneys general. A   of the team’s facility. A player  , with the team later issuing a statement using the incident as a political tool. His  . Some of Rivera’s problems — especially in football operations — were self-created. Others, such as the unrelenting chaos in the final days of former owner Daniel Snyder’s tenure, were beyond his control. On Friday, as Rivera reflected on his tenure, his comments about a stretch in the 2022 season summed it up. “The focus was on stuff that didn’t have anything to do with football,” he said. “That was really what I felt like I was always fighting, trying to keep the focus on the players.” Let’s look back at the best and worst of the Rivera era. It’s not even close. Going into the first round of the 2020 playoffs, quarterback injuries forced Washington to turn to Heinicke, a former undrafted free agent from Old Dominion. Heinicke had washed out of the NFL and was   before he signed with the Washington Football Team as a quarantine quarterback. In the third quarter of the game against the Buccaneers, Heinicke scrambled, dived for the pylon and landed in local folklore.  , 31-23, but Heinicke’s surprising grit and heart gave rise to one of the franchise’s brightest moments in years. There were many bad football moments: embarrassing losses, serious injuries, Rivera’s   during news conferences,  , the   between Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne. And there were many serious off-the-field moments: Rivera’s cancer diagnosis. The  .   of allegations of workplace culture, financial malfeasance and sexual harassment. The fatal  .

In December, the team used the incident to criticize D.C.’s attorney general, who was investigating allegations the team had  . The team later  . There aren’t many contenders for this superlative. Most of the Commanders’ pillar players were already here when Rivera arrived, and his regime  . Rivera’s best move was made for him. In early 2022, Washington   and was willing to offer a package that included three first-round draft picks. But Wilson wouldn’t waive his no-trade clause. The Commanders’ backup plan —   — was a far cheaper mistake than landing Wilson would have been. Seattle traded Wilson and a fourth-round pick to Denver for a major haul of five picks — two first-rounders, two seconds and a fifth — as well as three players. Denver gave Wilson a huge contract extension to tie him to the team for seven years and $296 million. This season, Denver   Wilson and is preparing to take the expensive step of jettisoning him in the offseason. Rivera never found a franchise quarterback. He passed on drafting one in 2020,   as a bridge in 2021, overpaid to trade for Carson Wentz in 2022 and   in 2023. Nine quarterbacks played for Rivera, and none were the answer. Rivera felt the heat. In 2022, he said   was “quarterback” and then, a few days later, ranted that he, not Snyder, had traded for Wentz, saying, “I’m the f---ing guy that looked at the analytics!” It was an impossible task. But for all of Rivera’s faults as head of football personnel and for all the disappointments of his team’s play on the field, it’s clear his players appreciated his earnest commitment to them. After his final game,  , and players spoke glowingly about what it was like to play for him. That sentiment won’t appease frustrated fans. It didn’t often translate to wins. But it’s fair to argue Rivera’s strengths fit well with Snyder’s chaotic exit. A coach with different strengths might not have been able to keep things together as long as Rivera did — even though it all fell apart at the very end. Given a blank slate and total control, Rivera essentially  . He brought in executives, coaches and players who, in nine seasons with the Panthers, had been mostly mediocre. In 2021, Rivera hired former Carolina general manager Marty Hurney as a senior executive, and San Francisco General Manager John Lynch  : “I feel like everybody doubted, ‘Could it work with [Rivera] and Marty?’ ” Rivera stood by his people, including when defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio called the   attack on the U.S. Capitol   Rivera often made moves only when situations became untenable, such as the firings of offensive coordinator Scott Turner, Vermillion and Del Rio. There’s a long list of over-drafted prospects and bad free agent signings. Rivera’s teams pulled off a few big upsets, including one against Tom Brady and two on the road against undefeated teams. But the   on national TV stands above them because it was the biggest win of Rivera’s tenure, key to later winning the NFC East and an important reminder for some fans that, even though the franchise had just retired the old moniker, it could still whoop Dallas on Thanksgiving. Plus, two of Rivera’s draft picks — running back Antonio Gibson (three touchdowns) and defensive end Chase Young (one sack, two tackles for loss) — showed immense promise. There are plenty of choices. Washington was favored by three or more points 12 times under Rivera and went 5-7 in those games. But the worst loss was Cleveland at home in Week 17 of 2022. In early December, Washington was 7-5, on track for a playoff berth, and then it collapsed down the stretch. Rivera  , saying he wanted “a little bit of a spark,” and Wentz crumbled. Cleveland — which was already eliminated from playoff contention — eliminated the Commanders. Rivera had one of his most infamous gaffes in the postgame news conference when he said, apparently unaware, “We can be eliminated?”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F7POOJ37XK75ESEW466EBVYEHE.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F7POOJ37XK75ESEW466EBVYEHE.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F7POOJ37XK75ESEW466EBVYEHE.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F7POOJ37XK75ESEW466EBVYEHE.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F7POOJ37XK75ESEW466EBVYEHE.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F7POOJ37XK75ESEW466EBVYEHE.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/ron-rivera-best-worst-commanders/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 19:50:00,

DENVER — Valeri Nichushkin scored the only goal in the shootout, and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Boston Bruins 4-3 on Monday night. The first five shooters couldn’t convert but Nichushkin beat Jeremy Swayman with a shot under his glove. Colorado bounced back from an 8-4 loss to Florida on Saturday to win for the fifth time in six games. “From start to finish that’s probably one of our most complete games of the year,” coach Jared Bednar said. “Just the way we played, competed, took care of the puck — it was a really good hockey game.” Sam Malinski, Mikko Rantanen and Logan O’Connor had goals and Alexandar Georgiev had 23 saves through overtime and three more in the shootout for the Avalanche. “Anytime you’re able to contribute to a big win it feels good,” said Malinski, who was recalled from the Colorado Eagles of the AHL to replace Josh Manson (undisclosed) in the lineup. “Considering it’s my first game back it makes a little bit more special.” Nathan MacKinnon had an assist to continue his dominant play in Denver, where he has 16 goals and 29 assists. He has registered at least one point in all 22 home games this season and is one shy of tying Joe Sakic for the longest home point streak in franchise history. Brad Marchand had two goals, John Beecher also scored and Swayman stopped 33 shots for Boston, which opened a four-game road trip with a loss. Defenseman Brandon Carlo left the game early in the second with an upper-body injury. Coach Jim Montgomery had no update on Carlo’s condition after the game. The Bruins had a chance to win it in overtime when they got a 4-on-3 power play but couldn’t get one by Georgiev. “Unfortunately we couldn’t get that second point,” Marchand said. “We kind of squandered the power play in overtime so we need to be better there in those opportunities to close out games.” Malinski got his second goal of the season when his shot from the point at 17:56 of the second beat Swayman to give the Avalanche a 3-2 lead. “He’s played really well when he’s been with us,” Bednar said of the rookie, who played in his 15th game Monday night. “We have a couple of (defensemen) out of the lineup now so he’ll be here for a little bit.” Marchand’s second of the night and 17th of the season at 5:46 of the third tied it again. The teams traded power-play goals in the first period. Boston scored first on Marchand’s goal midway through the frame but Rantanen tied it at 16:13. O’Connor scored an unassisted goal off of a turnover just 2:23 into the second period but Beecher tied it 2 when he knocked in a rebound at 10:05 of the second. “The puck squirted out to me and I just wanted to get it off my tape quick,” O’Connor said of his sixth goal of the season.

"For three weeks, the Memphis Grizzlies got a taste of life with their franchise point guard, and it was sweet. Ja Morant got straight to work in mid-December upon   for flashing a gun on social media,  in his season debut, leading a four-game winning streak and, more generally, restoring the direction, hope, thrills and swagger that were so clearly lost in his absence. For three weeks, the Memphis Grizzlies got a taste of life with their franchise point guard, and it was sweet. Ja Morant got straight to work in mid-December upon   for flashing a gun on social media,  in his season debut, leading a four-game winning streak and, more generally, restoring the direction, hope, thrills and swagger that were so clearly lost in his absence. That’s why Monday’s news that   to address a labral tear in his right shoulder landed with a thud: The Grizzlies were mincemeat without him and electric with him, and they will play out the remaining three months of a lost season fully aware of the stark difference. Morant himself supplied a concise and apt summary of the gutting turn of events on social media: “Damn dawg.” During Morant’s suspension, the Grizzlies went 6-19 and plunged out of the Western Conference playoff picture after finishing last season as the West’s No. 2 seed. With Morant, the Grizzlies went 6-3, posting a better winning percentage (.667) than they had during last year’s 51-win campaign (.622). That’s a small sample size, of course, but Memphis was hitting high notes it never dreamed of during  . In Morant’s final game before his injury, a 127-113 road win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday, the Grizzlies turned in perhaps their best performance of the season against the team that had coldly eliminated them in the first round last April. Memphis registered 33 assists on its 44 baskets and drilled a season-high 23 three-pointers, and Morant finished with 21 points, seven rebounds and seven assists while orchestrating the show. Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane and Marcus Smart looked comfortable in supporting roles, and the Grizzlies easily withstood 30-plus-point nights from LeBron James and Anthony Davis with poised play down the stretch. It was the kind of showing that made one wonder whether Morant and the young Grizzlies could track down the Lakers, the Golden State Warriors or the Phoenix Suns, three wavering veteran teams, and improbably claim a spot in the West’s play-in tournament. Morant’s skills pressuring the rim, finishing in traffic and finding the open man provided the Grizzlies with a clearer offensive identity than many of the teams above them in the standings had. This was a proven formula that works. But then Morant suffered the shoulder injury during practice Saturday, and now the other shoe drops. Memphis knows what this will look like: It ranked 30th in offensive efficiency during Morant’s 25-game suspension and found it impossible to replace his speed, vision, feel and athleticism. Jackson and Bane will again be tasked with more than they can handle effectively on offense, and Coach Taylor Jenkins must fill the crater in his backcourt rotation with a collection of spare parts. The deep field of playoff aspirants already sitting atop Memphis in the standings includes several teams, such as the Lakers and Warriors, who figure to be buyers before the Feb. 8 trade deadline. Sooner or later, that means the Grizzlies’ best course will almost certainly be to pull the plug and play for draft lottery ping-pong balls. Though this year’s draft class is regarded as relatively weak at the top compared with the past few, Memphis has typically excelled in talent identification — landing Morant, Jackson, Bane and other rotation players through the draft. What’s more, the Grizzlies could use another injection of long-term upside as they cope with serious injuries to Steven Adams and Brandon Clarke, and they will find it helpful to have another low-cost rookie deal as they move forward with the core trio of Morant, Jackson and Bane earning more than $95 million combined next season. The beneficial draft implications are a small consolation. While Morant’s injury effectively nukes Memphis’s season, it also will cost him valuable time that could have been spent repairing his reputation after a pair of self-inflicted gun suspensions and getting back on his superstar ascent. Morant was away from the court for nearly eight months after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver suspended him last summer, and he is looking at another nine-month absence before the start of next season. That’s an awfully long hiatus. Morant and the Grizzlies can take solace from his brief run because he averaged 25.1 points, 8.1 assists and 5.6 rebounds — nearly identical to his 2022-23 numbers. The rallying cry for Morant’s rehabilitation should be this: He didn’t skip a beat this season, so he won’t need to next season. Even so, the injury is a monumental mental test for Morant, who underwent counseling during his suspension, expressed gratitude upon his return, eagerly counted down the days until he could play and admitted to feeling “guilt” over the Grizzlies’ struggles without him. Morant’s goal, he said last month, was to reclaim his spot on the NBA’s stage with his “actions” because “just words probably won’t mean nothing to nobody.” Now, even the actions — the crossovers, floaters, double-clutch layups, alley-oop dunks and whizzing passes — must be put on hold, returning Morant to a ghostlike existence that leaves him, his team, his league and his fans with nothing but an agonizing wait.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATNM6YI2NPBR4RLBXU5LORXKNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATNM6YI2NPBR4RLBXU5LORXKNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATNM6YI2NPBR4RLBXU5LORXKNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATNM6YI2NPBR4RLBXU5LORXKNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATNM6YI2NPBR4RLBXU5LORXKNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ATNM6YI2NPBR4RLBXU5LORXKNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/09/ja-morant-grizzlies-hopeless/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 12:24:00,

"HOUSTON —  In the groggy hours of Monday night in the soulless cellars of a glitzy stadium, a human moment turned up. It happened as an erudite linebacker spoke on one side of the news conference dais and a fantastic coach listened on the other. HOUSTON —  In the groggy hours of Monday night in the soulless cellars of a glitzy stadium, a human moment turned up. It happened as an erudite linebacker spoke on one side of the news conference dais and a fantastic coach listened on the other. It had struck again, the thing sports does far, far better than anything else in the world: its capacity to convene those who never would have figured to meet and then send them into voluminous collaboration. Here was the formidable, 23-year-old, 236-pound son of Nigerians who immigrated to Alaska and then to Las Vegas, speaking of a nearby 49-year-old White South Dakotan who had become his coach in Seattle only 25½ heady months prior. Is there a better nod to a coach? Washington co-captain Edefuan Ulofoshio and Coach Kalen DeBoer had led and joined the throng of Huskies who had just gone all the way to 26-3 across two seasons and 14-0 in the second before becoming that touching being: the national runner-up. So as Ulofoshio kept speaking and DeBoer kept listening, you could almost feel all their toil, their obstacles, their collaboration and their bond. Was that fresh redness in the eyes of DeBoer, seated in easy earshot, just on the other side of  , Michael Penix Jr.? It was hard to tell, but how could anyone process such words without an attack on the ducts? There ended college football for 2023-24, with Michigan as champion and Washington as fellow winner and Ulofoshio speaking without an ounce of insincerity to convey that something real and valuable and meaningful does happen even in these unhinged days of the country’s most unhinged sport. So often college football can uphold Lily Tomlin’s peerless line about cynicism — “No matter how cynical you get, it is impossible to keep up” — so it’s something to go hurtling toward the final midnight and come across something stirring. Even with all the transience both bad and good — of conferences, of universities, of coaches and finally, this era, of players — powerful bonds form and matter. How reassuring, or how desperate, or whatever. Late-season news conferences, so often the bastions of manufactured drivel (maybe by necessity), managed to reveal much the same about Michigan this waning season. To hear Coach Jim Harbaugh go on and on and on and on about his players was to come upon something he absolutely meant. Hear him gush about running back Blake Corum or defensive back Mike Sainristil or so many others and then others and then others, and it could begin to sound timeless, guileless, doubtless. Come Tuesday morning after the long-sought title, the ninth-season Michigan coach warbled further, reiterating his take about the need to pay players something close to market value after the century-plus when college sports did not (except for scholarships and shenanigans). He dispensed pearls: “We’re all robbing the same train.” … “We saw a lot of change in one year, just this year. A whole conference [the Pac-12] went into the portal overnight.” … “I mean, everybody, they’re maximizing every single revenue source there is, but they’re not sharing it with the talent. There’s no business that that would ever fly.” … “I keep reading facts about how much money is being made. I mean, product placement. I can’t have a can of a different kind of soda up here. I have to put it into a cup here.” Asked if he would be willing to meet with NCAA stakeholders on behalf of players, Harbaugh said, “Yeah, anybody,” then added a comment — “I think they know my number” — that made the laughter rollick through the room. The faces of the two listeners flanking Harbaugh — Corum and all-Big Ten defensive back Will Johnson — registered appreciation all through the words, but it was a different news conference, early in December and late at night, that really could give an outsider a sense of Michigan’s version of the coach-player bond. It came after  , at a moment sure to go unnoticed (around midnight Dec. 2-3), 12 hours from everyone’s focus (the College Football Playoff selection committee naming the four playoff teams). Good gosh, what a love-in it was. “I would follow him to hell and back,” Harbaugh said of quarterback J.J. McCarthy. “Likewise,” McCarthy said. “I’ll tell you this,” Corum volunteered at another point. “I wouldn’t want to play for anybody else, Coach.” “Love you guys,” Harbaugh said. “Nobody,” McCarthy echoed. “Love you, too.” “Love you, too, Coach,” Sainristil echoed from McCarthy and Corum from the other side of Harbaugh. Sainristil, the deeply admirable player whose parents fled Haiti for Massachusetts shortly after his birth in 2000 and who somehow moved from wide receiver to primo defensive back, went on an unprovoked ode: “I don’t think I could have it any better than a coach like Coach Harbaugh who loves us as his sons. When you have a coach who loves you in that way, you’re able to, as a player, then love your coach as well as love your players. We’re direct reflections of how Coach Harbaugh treats us.” As the session moved toward the next question, Harbaugh turned to Sainristil — a Toledo-born 59-year-old man and the Haiti-born 23-year-old man — and whispered, “Thank you.” Somehow, there’s something still going where the coaches, with all their noted mercenariness and hucksterism and ego, wind up sitting and hearing heart-melting words they actually have earned. “I think it’s pretty clear,” DeBoer said of Ulofoshio and Penix et al. on Monday near midnight, “what these guys are made of.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DHMUFSWWKQN3M4BVZ4RBGHYQE_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DHMUFSWWKQN3M4BVZ4RBGHYQE_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DHMUFSWWKQN3M4BVZ4RBGHYQE_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DHMUFSWWKQN3M4BVZ4RBGHYQE_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DHMUFSWWKQN3M4BVZ4RBGHYQE_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DHMUFSWWKQN3M4BVZ4RBGHYQE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/09/college-football-players-love-their-coaches/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 17:55:00,
"RIGA, Latvia — Russian authorities have arrested a 32-year-old Russian-U.S. citizen over alleged drug charges, the Moscow court press service reported Tuesday. The dual citizen, Robert Romanov Woodland, was born in Russia, adopted as a toddler by an American couple and returned to live in Russia in 2020. He was detained Friday, according to a statement by the Ostankinsky District Court in Moscow, and ordered jailed until March 5 on charges of “illegal acquisition, storage, transportation, manufacture, processing of narcotic drugs.” RIGA, Latvia — Russian authorities have arrested a 32-year-old Russian-U.S. citizen over alleged drug charges, the Moscow court press service reported Tuesday. The dual citizen, Robert Romanov Woodland, was born in Russia, adopted as a toddler by an American couple and returned to live in Russia in 2020. He was detained Friday, according to a statement by the Ostankinsky District Court in Moscow, and ordered jailed until March 5 on charges of “illegal acquisition, storage, transportation, manufacture, processing of narcotic drugs.” Romanov Woodland worked as an English teacher, according to a Facebook profile bearing his name and birth date. He was adopted as an orphan from Perm by American couple Marcia and David Woodland when he was 2 years old in 1993, he told the Moscow newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda in December 2020. He said his name at birth was Roman Romanov and that his birth date was Dec. 7, 1991. He moved permanently back to Russia in 2020, according to the Facebook profile and the newspaper interview. “The truth is that I am not an American at all, but a Russian,” the newspaper quoted him as saying. The U.S. State Department has accused Russian authorities of improperly detaining two Americans in Russia. Evan Gershkovich, 33, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was arrested last year and accused of spying. Paul Whelan, 53, a security consultant, was jailed in 2018 and convicted of spying and sentenced to a 16-year prison term in 2020. Both men and the State Department have strongly denied the charges. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that Russian and U.S. officials were   over Gershkovich but denied reports that Moscow had rejected an offer to free him. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby has said talks were underway regarding Gershkovich and Whelan. WNBA star Brittney Griner was arrested in February 2022 for carrying vape oil containing traces of cannabis. She was convicted in August that year and   to 9½ years in prison. In December 2022, she was exchanged for Russian arms trafficker Victor Bout, who was convicted and imprisoned in the United States. The State Department did not immediately comment on Romanov Woodland’s arrest. Russian Telegram media outlet MASH, known to be close to Russian law enforcement, reported that the case against Woodland Romanov is related to illegal drug production, carrying a possible term of up to 20 years in prison. Romanov Woodland told Komsomolskaya Pravda that his parents, American scientists, adopted him after seeing a video of him playing in the orphanage and that they loved him and an adopted sister “very much.” After college, he got a job washing dishes in a hospital kitchen. He tracked down his birth mother, Galina Romanova, with his adoptive parents’ support and was reunited with her on a Russian state television program. He returned briefly to the United States before moving back to Russia permanently. He told Komsomolskaya Pravda that he missed his American family and phoned them often. In August 2021, according to an Instagram profile in his name linked to the Facebook profile, he received a Russian passport. In 2022, when Russia mobilized more than 300,000 men to fight in Ukraine, Romanov Woodland posted a message to family and friends on Facebook saying that he did not support the war but that if mobilized, “I will not turn away.” According to the Facebook profile, Romanov Woodland attended Saranac Lake Senior High School in northern New York state and Massanutten Military Academy in Virginia and worked as a prep cook at Dillon Dam Brewery in 2020 before moving to Russia.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3VF3GUHWECMS3Y5NFHCADCTEVY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3VF3GUHWECMS3Y5NFHCADCTEVY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3VF3GUHWECMS3Y5NFHCADCTEVY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3VF3GUHWECMS3Y5NFHCADCTEVY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3VF3GUHWECMS3Y5NFHCADCTEVY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3VF3GUHWECMS3Y5NFHCADCTEVY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/09/us-citizens-russian-arrested-drugs/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 15:55:00,

A European Union study on how it should spend tens of billions of euros in high-tech investments warns that Europe may need to use the money to guard against geopolitical risks such as potential U.S. decline and the rise of China or Russia. The  by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Research and Innovation sketches out scenarios such as a U.S. turn to isolationism, the establishment of an E.U. army, the growth of a Chinese military presence on the edges of Europe and a renewed invasion by Russia into Ukraine as potential events over the next decade that the E.U. may need to prepare for with targeted technological investment. “This is a reflection of the high level of uncertainty we are confronted with,” Matthias Weber, the report’s lead author, said in an interview. “There aren’t safe bets anymore because there are too many uncertainties.” The study, published last month, is intended to project what the world may look like in the year 2040 as a guide for outlays under the EU’s flagship Horizon Europe research and development program for 2025 to 2027. It was drafted by a group of academic experts and European Commission staff members who began work in January 2022 and completed the report in August, months before it was published. Areas identified in the report as research priorities for the E.U. include artificial intelligence, climate change, “transhumanist” technologies to extend the human life span, hydrogen fuel and nanotechnologies, or the study of materials generally too small to be visible to the human eye. The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Research and Innovation   that the report will “contribute substantially” to the E.U.’s strategic plan for Horizon Europe, as well as its longer-term investment approach. “The conclusions drawn from this study will be instrumental in the definition of a European approach to R&I [research and innovation] in the coming years,” it said. The E.U. deliberations highlight a growing focus on security considerations in governments’ tech investments around the world during a period of renewed wars and Cold War-like rivalry. The United States and China are racing to develop next-generation technologies such as   and  , calling them critical for their military supply chains. Russia is building   to bolster its invasion of Ukraine; Washington has announced its own  . “Europe’s scientific performance may need to be more tightly coupled to security,” the E.U. report says. Weber, who directs the Center for Innovation Systems and Policy at the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT), says the study was an attempt to help the E.U. think out-of-the-box to prepare for potential risks. Weber said that his team’s mission was only to provide an analysis and that E.U. officials will make decisions on how to disburse the research funds in coming months. Horizon Europe runs from 2021 to 2027, and the majority of its 95.5 billion-euro budget has already been allocated, but funding distribution for 2025 to 2027 is not yet set. The authors raise questions over to what degree the E.U. should allow “autocratic states” — the report did not define the term, but generally it applies to countries where rulers hold absolute power and are not democratically elected — to participate in its research projects. The report argues that allowing them in is necessary to tackle some globalized challenges, versus keeping them at arm’s length for security considerations. Weber said their study did not involve granular discussion of individual companies or countries, but reflected the increased emphasis on security and autonomy among E.U. member states generally. The report considers a range of global scenarios that might emerge between now and 2040, including two that the authors dubbed “Mad Max” and “Home Alone.” In the “Mad Max” scenario, the E.U. is weakened by internal political crises, the United States has withdrawn into isolationism, the Middle East is beset with new armed conflicts, and Chinese and Russian influence is growing. The authors write that issues to watch would be governments increasing defense spending, less research cooperation with the United States pushing some European countries toward China, and an increase of AI-enabled policing tools “to tackle the growing international disorder.” The “Home Alone” scenario posits a “post-U.S.-hegemonic world order” in which the E.U. has built its own army and faces the decision of joining a military research alliance with China. In this scenario, the E.U. seeks to conduct research “with ‘trusted’ parties to strengthen its strategic autonomy and security,” even as some European nations “become more vulnerable to blackmailing efforts from authoritarian countries” because of reliance on their technological solutions. The authors also lay out a “New Hope” scenario in which the transatlantic partnership is restrengthened “with a generally benign and globally committed U.S.” The report’s main authors are Weber; Dana Wasserbacher, an AIT expert adviser; and Nikos Kastrinos, a European Commission policy officer, with the three drawing on input from scholars across Europe. The section with these three hypothetical scenarios lists as authors Susanne Giesecke of AIT and seven other researchers. Weber said their study group’s broad recommendation was for the E.U. to maintain a range of technological investments to prepare for whatever future emerges. “If there is one cross-cutting message from the entire report, I would probably say that this calls for more flexibility and adaptability,” he said. Other governments also conduct predictive and speculative studies to help guide policymaking. The U.S. National Intelligence Council has published a “Global Trends” report every four years since 1997. The  , published in 2021, forecast that the U.S.-China rivalry would set the “broad parameters” for the geopolitical environment in the coming decades, and flagged China’s intensive efforts at becoming a technological leader. It also explored varying possible outcomes of this competition, ranging from the United States securing its global leadership role to China becoming the leading state to siloed spheres of influence. The Biden administration, like  ’s, has made countering China’s technological rise a key policy focus. The Biden administration is in the process of   in subsidies for U.S. semiconductor production to ensure China does not catch up. Similarly to the U.S. report, the E.U. study predicts continued global unrest in the coming years. “It is commonplace to say that the 21st century has been but a series of crises,” the report said. “Our exploration of disruptions indicates that the succession of crises is unlikely to stop.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNEERKF62UI6XERKYQGJO5F4JA.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNEERKF62UI6XERKYQGJO5F4JA.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNEERKF62UI6XERKYQGJO5F4JA.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNEERKF62UI6XERKYQGJO5F4JA.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNEERKF62UI6XERKYQGJO5F4JA.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNEERKF62UI6XERKYQGJO5F4JA.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/06/eu-tech-fund-report/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 06:16:00,

"More than a dozen Senate Democrats said Tuesday that they will seek to block President Biden’s request to skirt congressional oversight of arms transfers to Israel, the latest signal of frustration among members of his own political party who have recoiled at the stunning civilian death toll resulting from Israel’s offensive in Gaza. More than a dozen Senate Democrats said Tuesday that they will seek to block President Biden’s request to skirt congressional oversight of arms transfers to Israel, the latest signal of frustration among members of his own political party who have recoiled at the stunning civilian death toll resulting from Israel’s offensive in Gaza. Led by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the push comes as more Democrats, historically stalwart backers of the Jewish state, have urged the president to step up efforts to rein in America’s chief ally in the Middle East. International human rights groups have accused Israel of conducting indiscriminate bombing in Gaza amounting to war crimes. Nearly   in the past three months of fighting in the densely populated enclave, according to Gaza health officials, as Israel wages a devastating campaign in retaliation for the cross-border attack by   militants that left 1,200 dead. The Biden administration, which rushed to back Israel after Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre, has been unusually secretive about its ongoing military support program, and is seeking to exempt its arms transfers from a mandatory congressional notification process that applies to all other foreign arms sales. Administration officials   in that regard late last month, angering Democrats by invoking an emergency authority and the “urgency of Israel’s defensive needs” to approve a $147.5 million sale of artillery rounds and related equipment. At the moment, lawmakers are negotiating over Biden’s request for more than $10 billion in additional military assistance for Israel — already the largest recipient of U.S. security aid — as part of a $106 billion supplemental budget request that would pay for a host of national security initiatives. The proposal also would provide billions of dollars for U.S. border security, as well as military assistance for Ukraine and Taiwan, but remains stalled as Republicans and Democrats search for an agreement on immigration reforms targeting illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border. Biden’s request, according to bill text released by the Senate Appropriations Committee, included a provision saying “any congressional notification requirement applicable to funds made available … for Israel may be waived if the Secretary of State determines that to do so is in the national security interest of the United States.” Kaine and his fellow Senate Democrats Martin Heinrich (N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Peter Welch (Vt.), Ben Ray Luján (N.M.), Dick Durbin (Ill.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Raphael G. Warnock (Ga.), Tom Carper (Del.) and Chris Murphy (Conn.) — said their amendment would strike that provision. “I have strongly supported U.S. aid necessary for Israel’s defense,” Kaine said in a statement, “but all nations should be subject to the same standard.” The statement stops short of condemning the Israeli offensive or making other demands of the administration to restrain Israel. Other Democrats in the House and Senate have been far more critical, calling on the administration to force Israel to meet certain conditions to receive U.S. aid or openly opposing any further assistance. The Democratic Party’s left flank has been particularly vocal in urging Biden to take a stronger stance in support of Palestinian human rights. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)   that he opposes the administration’s additional aid request for Israel, calling the campaign in Gaza “grossly disproportionate, immoral, and in violation of international law.” “And, most importantly for Americans, we must understand that Israel’s war against the Palestinian people has been significantly waged with U.S. bombs, artillery shells, and other forms of weaponry,” Sanders said in a statement. A number of other lawmakers have called for the administration   on American weapons transfers. The administration’s lack of transparency also has prompted Democrats in Congress to demand basic information about its assistance to Israel, and the parameters of Israel’s goals, methods and process for measuring success in Gaza. Critics have drawn comparisons to Biden’s approach in aiding Ukraine, which the administration says also faces a dire need for more weaponry in its fight against Russia. Since the war there began two years ago, the State Department and Pentagon have publicly documented tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZ7QBD63JCDAOAWQP2ECEYAJRQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZ7QBD63JCDAOAWQP2ECEYAJRQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZ7QBD63JCDAOAWQP2ECEYAJRQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZ7QBD63JCDAOAWQP2ECEYAJRQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZ7QBD63JCDAOAWQP2ECEYAJRQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KZ7QBD63JCDAOAWQP2ECEYAJRQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/09/israel-weapons-biden-democrats/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 14:54:00,

He guided the team to an improbable NFC East title despite a 7-9 record that season, but failed to finish above. 500 or qualify for the postseason in any season since, and the franchise’s   continues. Rivera   as the final coach hired by former owner Daniel Snyder, who oversaw  . Rivera’s tenure, sadly, fit right in. Rivera’s teams over his four years were 4.3 points worse than an average team per game after adjusting their margin of victory for strength of schedule, according to Pro Football Reference’s Simple Rating System. That’s actually worse than the franchise managed under Jim Zorn, the oft-mocked coach who followed Joe Gibbs’s second go-round in Washington. Of coaches Snyder hired who lasted more than one season, only Jay Gruden (4.6 points fewer per game than an average team) and Steve Spurrier (5.1 points fewer per game than an average team) posted worse numbers. Washington’s adjusted margin of victory during Rivera’s tenure ranked 26th in the NFL. Gibbs was clearly the most — or perhaps only — successful coach of the Snyder era, according to both record and the Simple Rating System. Gibbs’s teams were 30-34 (a .469 winning percentage) and were 0.8 points better than an average team per game during his second stint with Washington, which included playoff appearances after the 2005 and 2007 seasons. Washington finished plus-6.0 and plus-4.5 in 2005 and 2007, the two best seasons of the Snyder era by SRS. Perhaps surprisingly, Zorn’s teams posted the second-best average margin of victory adjusted for strength of schedule (minus-3.2) among this group of coaches, followed by Mike Shanahan (minus-3.5) and Rivera. (Gruden’s .418 winning percentage, on the other hand, was second-best behind Gibbs of coaches hired under Snyder who lasted at least two years.) Washington finished this season with the third-worst raw point differential in a single season in franchise history, albeit in a 17-game campaign. The Carolina Panthers, according to ESPN, were the first NFL team to be shut out in back-to-back games since 2008. They   had a better final point differential than Commanders. The Commanders were 11.1 points per game worse than an average team this season, which is the   since it was founded in 1932. The three worst campaigns occurred before the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Shanahan’s worst team in Washington — the 2013 squad that finished 3-13 — was 9.3 points per game worse than an average team. Zorn’s worst season was 2009, when the burgundy and gold were 4.6 points worse per game than an average team and finished 4-12. Washington was only 1.8 points worse than an average team per game in 2008, Zorn’s first season at the helm. Here’s a closer look at how Rivera’s tenure stacks up against Washington’s non-interim coaches not named Gibbs since 2002. Coaches are ranked based on their average margin of victory adjusted for strength of schedule during their tenures. Zorn was originally hired to be Washington’s offensive coordinator, but was promoted to head coach after Snyder decided against hiring Jim Fassel. During a 4-1 start to Zorn’s first season, Washington celebrated wins at Dallas and Philadelphia in consecutive weeks with chants of “hip, hip, hooray.” No, it wasn’t bringing former NFL offensive coordinator and part-time senior center bingo caller Sherman Lewis out of retirement to serve as an offensive consultant in 2009. Before Lewis’s arrival, the offense scored an estimated eight points fewer per game than expected (26th) after accounting for each play, per data from TruMedia. Washington had an average offense from Weeks 7 to 17, coinciding with Lewis’s tenure. The real defining moment of Zorn’s tenure came in a 45-12 home loss to the Giants on “Monday Night Football” in Week 15 of that 4-12 season, when Washington ran the infamous  “They all got their gear all ready, and so they’re going to be all colored up in the maroon and black and yellow,” Zorn said at his introductory news conference in February 2008, referring to his family and apparently confused about Washington’s burgundy and gold color scheme. Snyder hired Shanahan, who won two Super Bowls in Denver, to replace Zorn in 2010. Outside of Robert Griffin III’s magical rookie season in 2012, Shanahan’s four years in Washington were a failure. Shanahan’s Washington teams ranked 23rd in points per drive and 22nd in red-zone offense. Washington’s quarterbacks ranked 21st in passer rating (81.0) under Shanahan. Behind Griffin and rookie running back Alfred Morris, Washington beat the Cowboys, 28-18, on “Sunday Night Football” in the 2012 regular season finale to  . In Shanahan’s first season, Washington lost to the Eagles, 59-28, on “Monday Night Football.” The rout came on the same day Washington announced   for quarterback Donovan McNabb. “I take full responsibility for this game today,” Shanahan said after a   at home in Week 14 of his final season. “I didn’t have the players ready to play.” With Sunday’s loss, Rivera fell to 26-40-1 in Washington and 102-103-2 in his NFL coaching career. In Week 13 of the 2020 season, Washington overcame an early 14-0 deficit to  , 23-17, in Pittsburgh. It was Washington’s third of four consecutive wins after a 2-7 start, and it helped propel the team to a division title. Rivera’s teams were on the wrong end of several embarrassing blowouts, but last season’s   in Week 17 after Rivera opted to start Carson Wentz over Taylor Heinicke with a playoff berth on the line was rock bottom. “We can be eliminated?” Rivera, seemingly unaware that Washington’s playoff hopes were about to be dashed,   during his postgame news conference following the loss to the Browns. Gruden was the longest-tenured and winningest coach of the Snyder era, but the franchise only made the playoffs once in his five full seasons at the helm. The Kirk Cousins-led comeback —   — in a game Gruden described as a   is up there, but the best moment of Gruden’s tenure came two months later, when Washington clinched the NFC East title with a   at Lincoln Financial Field. Developing Cousins, a fourth-round pick by Shanahan in 2012, was one of Gruden’s greatest achievements. Washington needed to beat the Giants, who had nothing left to play for, in the 2016 regular season finale to clinch a second consecutive playoff berth for the first time since 1992. Washington lost,  , after Cousins threw a crucial late-game interception. “If the key works Monday, I’ll keep working,” Gruden said after Washington fell to 0-5 with a 33-7 loss to the New England Patriots in 2019. Snyder   the next morning. One of Snyder’s many mistakes was firing Marty Schottenheimer after one season and replacing him with Spurrier, who had spent the previous 12 years at the University of Florida and had no NFL coaching experience. Washington defeated Tom Brady and the Patriots in Week 4 of Spurrier’s second season to improve to 3-1. It was one of two losses the eventual Super Bowl champions suffered that season. Washington went 2-10 over the remainder of the 2003 season, including a 27-0 home loss to the Cowboys in Week 15. Tim Hasselbeck threw four interceptions as part of Washington’s six turnovers. “We wound up 5-11,” Spurrier said at his farewell news conference. “Not very good. But there were some worse than us. I guess that’s one positive way to look at it.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B2FIQKEZK5G2BO7PNKEDRYVVS4.png&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B2FIQKEZK5G2BO7PNKEDRYVVS4.png&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B2FIQKEZK5G2BO7PNKEDRYVVS4.png&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B2FIQKEZK5G2BO7PNKEDRYVVS4.png&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B2FIQKEZK5G2BO7PNKEDRYVVS4.png&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B2FIQKEZK5G2BO7PNKEDRYVVS4.png&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/ron-rivera-jim-zorn-steve-spurrier-mike-shanahan-jay-gruden/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 09:48:00,
"TEL AVIV — Disagreements between the United States and Israel over the Jewish state’s treatment of Palestinians emerged during Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to Israel on Tuesday as leaders aired opposing views over when Palestinians can return to northern Gaza and receive tax revenue collected by Israel. “These are their revenues,” Blinken told reporters here. “They should have them.” Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has vowed not to transfer any tax money to Gaza as long as he remains in that job. TEL AVIV — Disagreements between the United States and Israel over the Jewish state’s treatment of Palestinians emerged during Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to Israel on Tuesday as leaders aired opposing views over when Palestinians can return to northern Gaza and receive tax revenue collected by Israel. “These are their revenues,” Blinken told reporters here. “They should have them.” Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has vowed not to transfer any tax money to Gaza as long as he remains in that job. Blinken traveled to Israel on Monday to present a plan for Gaza’s future based on his discussions with Arab and Turkish leaders during a tour of the region. But he received little public response from Israeli officials. In meetings Tuesday with Israel’s president, prime minister, defense minister and emergency war cabinet, Blinken pressed Israel to reduce civilian casualties in its war on  , already one of the century’s  . About 23,000 people have been killed in Gaza over the past three months, health officials there say. But the gaps between Israeli and Arab leaders remain wide. Far-right members of the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are calling for the mass removal of civilians from Gaza. Israeli officials have dismissed U.S. calls for a “revamped and revitalized” Palestinian Authority to play a role in a postwar, Hamas-free Gaza. Blinken is pushing regional leaders to seize the crisis as an opportunity in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict. He told Israeli officials Monday that ending the war would allow the country to improve relations with its Arab neighbors. Those ties were notably warming until Hamas launched a lethal attack on Israeli communities in October and Israel responded with its campaign to eradicate the militant group. Blinken has said postwar rebuilding with non-Hamas Palestinians at the center could be a pathway to eventual statehood. But Blinken has not offered details on how the United States would overcome the obstacles that have bedeviled every previous U.S. administration that has tried to clear the way for a Palestinian state. Blinken’s two-day diplomatic blitz here, capping his fourth Middle East swing since Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, comes amid mixed signals from Israeli leaders about plans to ease the fight in Gaza. Blinken and his Israeli counterparts did agree on at least one point: The United Nations should assess conditions in northern Gaza, where Israeli bombardment has flattened homes and civilian infrastructure, to determine when residents might return.  But when that can happen remains a sticking point. Blinken told reporters that Gazans should be able to return as soon as they can safely do so. But Israeli officials told   that they will not allow for the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza until Hamas releases Israeli hostages. The Biden administration opposes that condition as a form of collective punishment. Israeli military officials have announced troop drawdowns in northern Gaza. They’ve said that they will now turn to more precisely targeted raids there. “Operations will continue in the north, but with a different scale,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters late Monday. “The war will continue in 2024 but in a different way. Reservists will be released. We will act in different ways according to the needs of the operational space.” A senior U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive military matters, confirmed that Israel had withdrawn several thousand troops in “a significant drawdown” in the north. Residents in the north said the level of intense fighting has dropped. “We hear booms, shootings and some airstrikes,” Gaza City resident Ramadan Amriti, 56, told The Washington Post. “It’s not completely safe or calm but better than before, with no doubt.” Fighting continues to rage in southern and central Gaza. Netanyahu and other officials have said there will be no end to hostilities for months. Almost 250 Gazans were killed in the 24 hours before Blinken’s arrival, health authorities there said. Israeli attacks Monday   in central Gaza, a region packed with tens of thousands of displaced civilians. Israelis have told Washington that they intend to scale back operations significantly in the next phase of the military campaign in Gaza, U.S. officials said, and will rely on fewer troops and reduce the massive air bombardments that have felled high-rises and leveled city blocks. Instead, the Israelis say they will deploy special forces to eliminate Hamas leaders and destroy the group’s tunnels and military infrastructure. U.S. officials conceded that previous such assurances did not materialize. Their hope is that the first troop reductions since ground operations began signal that Israeli officials are finally bending to U.S. lobbying, in addition to the economic strain of diverting tens of thousands of reservists from the workforce. “I think there is a desire here to respond to pressure from the Americans, who demand to reduce the harm of innocents in Gaza,” said Michael Milshtein, a former head of the Palestinian department in Israeli military intelligence. “But the needs of the Israeli economy cannot be ignored, as well, and perhaps also the northern front,” referring to Hezbollah troops massing along Israel’s border with Lebanon. Blinken was pushing his Israeli counterparts to reduce the intensity of the fighting in Gaza as quickly as possible, U.S. officials said, while he also urged   forces. Hezbollah and Israeli troops have exchanged fire almost daily over the last three months,  . A drone strike last week that U.S. officials say was launched by Israel killed a Hamas leader in his Beirut office, sparking fears that the conflagration would spread. A Hezbollah commander was also killed on Monday. “It’s clearly not in the interest of anyone — Israel, Lebanon, Hezbollah for that matter — to see this escalate,” Blinken said Monday. Israeli leaders have expressed a preference for a peaceful resolution on the border with Lebanon — but they’ve also warned that they won’t tolerate the tit-for-tat violence on the border indefinitely. “We prefer the path of an agreed-upon diplomatic settlement,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Friday. “But we are getting close to the point where the hourglass will turn over.” Israeli summaries of meetings with Blinken emphasized that Israel’s military campaign against Hamas and Hezbollah would not ease anytime soon. Gallant said that Israeli forces “will intensify” military operations in southern Gaza. Netanyahu rival Benny Gantz, seen as a moderating force in the government, told Blinken that Israel is committed to “change reality in northern Israel to enable the safe return home of its citizens” — a possible reference to military escalation against Hezbollah forces on the border. During his visits with Arab leaders, Blinken claimed progress in coordinating a plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and governance. Arab leaders have been reluctant to discuss their involvement publicly as scenes of the carnage emerge from the enclave daily and there’s no guarantee that investments in rebuilding wouldn’t be quickly undone by another war. The Biden administration considers financial support for reconstruction from Saudi Arabia and other energy-rich Gulf countries as essential to any long-term solution in Gaza. Blinken, before leaving Saudi Arabia, said he’s seen a willingness on the part of Gulf partners to contribute, but a nonnegotiable condition was that the West Bank and Gaza “should be united under Palestinian-led governance.” Israeli officials have objected to such a prospect. They have also shown little indication that they’re close to wrapping up the war on Hamas. Neither Israel nor the Biden administration supports a general cease-fire; they say it would give Hamas time to regroup and launch additional attacks inside Israel. Officials have said Hamas must release the more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza before Israel will pull back. CIA Director William J. Burns has been trying to broker a new release for the 107 hostages, some of them U.S. citizens, who are believed to be in Gaza. Blinken met Tuesday with family members of hostages. Their advocates camped in front of his hotel and called for the administration to push for the release of more hostages. “BIDEN ONLY YOU CAN SAVE THEM!” read one demonstrator’s sign. The meeting was at times contentious, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The families insisted that the United States, “as the most powerful country in the world,” should be doing more to free their relatives, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Before Blinken’s visit, Gallant, the defense minister, presented his own proposal for postwar Gaza to the war cabinet. This first public outline by a top official included elements favored by the Biden administration, such as the expectation that Palestinians will continue to live in the enclave. But it also includes nonstarters for U.S. officials, such as the exclusion of any role for the Palestinian Authority, which runs parts of the West Bank. Restoring order in Gaza is a top concern among U.S. and Israeli officials. In private discussions, Israeli officials have proposed relying on local leaders to provide security and distribute humanitarian aid. Amid food shortages, U.N. aid trucks in the enclave have been pillaged.  Residents in northern Gaza have largely been denied access to aid since fighting resumed after a pause more than a month ago. U.N. officials described the problem to Blinken when he visited a World Food Program warehouse in Jordan. He said expanding access to aid was a priority of his visit. In his meeting Tuesday with Netanyahu and Israel’s war cabinet, Blinken advocated for the United Nations’ work and praised the appointment of a U.N. coordinator for reconstruction in Gaza, his spokesman said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5N55IAGN34T4JONWLECFWZ7EZY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5N55IAGN34T4JONWLECFWZ7EZY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5N55IAGN34T4JONWLECFWZ7EZY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5N55IAGN34T4JONWLECFWZ7EZY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5N55IAGN34T4JONWLECFWZ7EZY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5N55IAGN34T4JONWLECFWZ7EZY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/09/israel-gaza-hamas-blinken/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 17:09:00,
"In late 2022, NASA   by flying the Orion spacecraft, without anyone on board, in a test flight around the moon. Now, it is aiming for the surface. In the wee hours Monday morning, a spacecraft owned and operated by a commercial company and without anyone on board is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral on a mission that could result in a landing Feb. 23, marking the first American soft landing on the lunar surface in more than 50 years. If successful, it would also serve to kick-start a fleet of robotic missions NASA hopes to send to the moon in the coming years by working with private industry to eventually return astronauts there. In late 2022, NASA   by flying the Orion spacecraft, without anyone on board, in a test flight around the moon. Now, it is aiming for the surface. In the wee hours Monday morning, a spacecraft owned and operated by a commercial company and without anyone on board is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral on a mission that could result in a landing Feb. 23, marking the first American soft landing on the lunar surface in more than 50 years. If successful, it would also serve to kick-start a fleet of robotic missions NASA hopes to send to the moon in the coming years by working with private industry to eventually return astronauts there. The next launch to the moon could come in mid-February, when another company, Intuitive Machines, is scheduled to launch its lander to the moon on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. On Friday, a spokesman for the company said it is targeting a landing on Feb. 22 or before, which, if successful, would beat Astrobotic by a day and make Intuitive Machines the first commercial entity to land on the moon. Monday’s launch of the Astrobotic spacecraft would mark another potentially important milestone, the first flight of a long-awaited new rocket designed by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The Pentagon is eager to use the rocket, dubbed Vulcan, to launch national security missions, but first ULA needs to successfully complete two certification missions before it would be allowed to launch satellites for the Defense Department. Monday’s launch, scheduled for 2:18 a.m. Eastern, is also a big moment for Blue Origin, the space venture founded by Jeff Bezos. Two BE-4 engines manufactured by Blue Origin will power the first stage of ULA’s Vulcan rocket in their first flight. Bezos and ULA’s CEO, Tory Bruno, first announced the engine   after ULA, which had been using Russian engines, was forced by Congress to find a domestic supplier. But the engines took much longer to develop than initially anticipated, forcing a delay in the debut of Vulcan. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Blue Origin also intends to fly its   for the first time this year. It is powered by seven BE-4 engines. The missions come as NASA is working toward the second flight of Orion around the moon, this time with four people on board: NASA astronauts Christina Koch, Victor Glover and Reid Wiseman as well as Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen. Currently, the flight, a 10-day mission around the moon known as Artemis II, is scheduled for late this year. But that could slip into 2025, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in an interview, as engineers continue to study how the capsule’s heat shield performed during its first flight to the moon. While there was still plenty of margin, NASA officials said, more of the heat shield burned off during reentry than had been anticipated. “At some point all these technical geniuses are going to come together and make a decision,” Nelson said. “I’m very optimistic that they will have the heat shield with the integrity they want. But obviously, we’re not going to fly until we do, and we’ll have that answer pretty soon.” Meanwhile, SpaceX continues to test its Starship rocket and spacecraft, the vehicle NASA has selected to land astronauts on the moon for the first two human landings under Artemis. Its two previous launch attempts failed to reach orbit, but Elon Musk’s company showed significant progress between them. Recently, it test-fired the engines of the next booster and ship it intends to launch. It appears to be getting close to another attempt but still needs sign-off from the Federal Aviation Administration. Astrobotic’s Peregrine spacecraft will take a fairly direct route to the moon, Astrobotic CEO John Thornton said in a November briefing. But its landing will be delayed until Feb. 23 as it loiters in lunar orbit, waiting for the sun to shine on the intended landing spot. “Most of the time between launch and landing is actually waiting for the local lighting to be correct,” he said. “So basically we’re trying to land at a specific spot on the moon at a specific time, i.e., morning at this location.” On Friday, he told reporters that the company faced “a whole lot of challenges that we’ve had to overcome” including “a lot of doubters.” “When we started in Pittsburgh,” he said, referring to the company’s headquarters, “the idea of building a space company, much less one to go to the moon, was completely foreign and alien. And folks certainly and literally laughed at the concept.” He said he was well aware of the difficulty of landing on the moon and of the past failures of so many other attempts. “It will be exciting, nail-biting and terrifying all at once — a whole range of emotions,” he said. “If you look back in the course of history, only about half of those missions have been successful. And most of those have been funded by superpowers with vastly larger budgets than this mission has been granted. So it’s a really, really big challenge.” Still, he said, “To be leading America back to the surface of the moon for the first time since Apollo is a momentous honor that we’re lucky to be to be a part of.” NASA said Friday that the value of Astrobotic’s contract is $108 million. A spokesperson for Intuitive Machines said the company expects its spacecraft to touch down “approximately seven days after launch.” But it has said only that its launch date would come in mid-February, so it’s not clear which company will land first. There are a number of other significant space events coming up in 2024. On Jan. 19, the Japanese space agency intends to land a robotic vehicle on the moon, an outcome that would make Japan the fifth country to do so. But landing on the moon is risky — and many have tried and failed in the past. Last year, ispace, a Japanese company,   as it attempted to land on the moon. Russia also   attempting a lunar landing last year. Axiom, a Houston-based company, intends to fly its third private astronaut mission to the space station on Jan. 17. And in February, SpaceX is set to launch its eighth crew rotation mission to the International Space Station. In April, Jared Isaacman, the billionaire entrepreneur who commissioned a private astronaut mission aboard SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, also is scheduled to fly another all-civilian mission. This time, the crew would step outside Dragon to perform a spacewalk using pressure suits designed by SpaceX. Also in April, Boeing is expected to launch a pair of NASA astronauts to the space station on the first crewed test flight of its Starliner spacecraft. If that is successful, it would finally give NASA a way besides SpaceX to get its astronauts to space. Boeing, which was granted a contract to ferry astronauts to the space station in 2014, at the same time as SpaceX, has faced years of setbacks and delays and has yet to fly with crew, something SpaceX has done several times. SpaceX launched a record 98 rockets to orbit in 2023 and is looking to launch as many as 144 this year, as it continues to put up its Starlink internet satellite constellation.  — ULA plans to launch an Astrobotic spacecraft to the moon aboard a Vulcan rocket powered by engines manufactured by Blue Origin.  — Axiom plans to launch a group of private citizens to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket, Axiom’s third charter mission to the space station.  — The Japanese space agency plans to land a robotic vehicle on the moon.

And in Washington, where it concerns the local NFL franchise, he might as well have donned a top hat, twirled a cane in the air and jigged across the stage in Ashburn as he sang his answers. The tune is just that different. Josh Harris spoke rather flatly, and someone from another town who roots for another team might have taken his address about the future as, well, boring. But Harris is from Washington. He owns the Washington Commanders. And in Washington, where it concerns the local NFL franchise, he might as well have donned a top hat, twirled a cane in the air and jigged across the stage in Ashburn as he sang his answers. The tune is just that different. Monday was about   as coach and chief football decision-maker, because that was a silly setup from day one. But much more than that, Monday was about Harris further distancing himself — in style, substance, word and deed — from his predecessor, he who shall not be named (yet). Before Harris makes the hires that will determine whether his group is a success with the Commanders, jump for joy at that. It’s encouraged and allowed. Where to start? How about this, by way of the hiring process that will lead to a revamped organizational structure: “My desire is to have the head of football operations in place and then to listen very hard to what that person wants to do in terms of the coaching staff,” Harris said Monday at the Commanders’ Ashburn headquarters. “In other words, I think those two things have to work together. “And obviously, as I’ve said before, I want to get the best talent here and then hold them accountable and work with them, right? So what that person wants to do or not do is really important in our decision process. Doesn’t mean that you are not involved in it, but it means that to a large extent you’re relying on that person to bring a series of candidates to the table.” Anywhere else, that is just the normal state of affairs for a stable, well-run franchise. Breaking news: This hasn’t, for years and decades, been a stable, well-run franchise. So in Washington, the above articulation of structure — an orderly chain of command — is a sea change. You’re telling me that the owner is going to diligently and thoughtfully work to hire a chief football executive — that there will even   a chief football executive, with no responsibilities on the business side, the stadium side or the marketing side? And that person will be responsible for vetting coaching candidates? And those people will be accountable for doing their jobs, but the owner won’t meddle in those duties? Knock me over with a feather. Josh, continue, please. What else?  “Being the head of football operations, being in essence in that lead role, that’s an 80-hour-a-week job,” Harris said. “Being a head coach, that’s an 80-hour-a-week job. I think there are two roles there. … “There are certainly individuals that control everything. It’s increasingly hard, so my orientation is not to do that. But on the other hand, I’m going to be somewhat flexible around talent.” Again, in most places, a nothingburger. In Washington, a godsend. The owner recognizes the enormity of assembling a roster and managing a front office and the parallel colossus of overseeing a coaching staff, preparing game plans and motivating players — and will separate the two. It’s not Rivera’s fault that he who shall not be named ( , Daniel Snyder) bestowed upon Rivera two jobs that were too big for most men and certainly for the man he chose. But it is on Harris to fix that mess, and even without knowing whom he hires, we know the setup should be better from now going forward. Harris spoke for nearly 19 minutes Monday. It’s hard to find something to nitpick about his approach and his articulation of it. Maybe it’s overthinking things to bring in longtime NBA executive and agent Bob Myers to help him identify candidates and build a front office, and maybe career NFL front-office man Rick Spielman isn’t a home run of a hire to advise on the football side of the process.  . But their presence reveals two things about that process: Harris knows he doesn’t know everything about what he’s undertaking — both from organizational and football standpoints — and he isn’t afraid to ask smart people for help. That’s a long way from Snyder making Jim Zorn dress in a suit for endless hours of interviews at his mansion overlooking the Potomac. Yes, the bar in Ashburn concerning ownership is so low you couldn’t slide a single-ply piece of tissue under it. But it’s almost as if Harris —   — considered what Snyder did and how Snyder acted and actively decided to do the opposite. If so, smart messaging. If this is just who he is and how he goes about things, even better. Look at the two quotes above. In the first, Harris uses a word that was anathema to his predecessor: Listen. In the second, he lays out what he believes is a proper organizational structure — but allows that he is open to interviewing a talented individual who might make things work differently and then adjusting to those talents. What a world. There is work to be done, and timing matters. It’s possible that the competition for   heats up before a head of football operations is hired. That could get sticky and throw off Harris’s desired workflow. He knows that and is willing to improvise if necessary. But he also knows he has taken a job that was truly attractive only to desperados and retreads and made it something that could be downright desirable. Unfortunately, that’s first and foremost because of who he isn’t. We’re still learning who he is and who he will be. Monday showed, though, that the honeymoon is still on. Harris and his partners took ownership in July. Removing Rivera and replacing him with serious, promising, forward-thinking football executives will be his group’s first major, lasting stamp on the franchise. “It’s important that I do this personally,” he said, “and get this right.” That’s right. But it’s also important that he clearly explain how he envisions the result, that he acknowledges that he doesn’t know what he doesn’t know and that he delegates to talented and capable people. That might be the normal course of business in other NFL cities. It’s transformative in Washington.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DHIZMJSKMYJM46WGCEYJDVJCYA.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DHIZMJSKMYJM46WGCEYJDVJCYA.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DHIZMJSKMYJM46WGCEYJDVJCYA.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DHIZMJSKMYJM46WGCEYJDVJCYA.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DHIZMJSKMYJM46WGCEYJDVJCYA.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DHIZMJSKMYJM46WGCEYJDVJCYA.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/josh-harris-commanders-coaching-search/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 18:15:00,

And as an appeals court took up Trump’s   from criminal prosecution on Tuesday, the stark, self-serving shifts in Trump’s standards amid his own legal jeopardy got their day in court, too. The thrust of the argument put forward by Trump attorney D. John Sauer was that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts, unless Congress first impeaches and convicts him. Judge Florence Y. Pan asked Sauer if that immunity would apply even to a president who orders SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival but isn’t impeached and convicted for it. Sauer strained to avoid a yes-or-no answer but indicated   — that immunity would apply Perhaps the most instructive pushback from the   came when Trump’s actual impeachment was broached. Both Pan and Judge Karen L. Henderson, the one Republican-appointed judge on the panel, suggested that Sauer’s argument flew in the face of how other Trump attorneys sought to beat back his second impeachment, after the  , 2021, insurrection. Indeed, back then the argument was that Trump couldn’t be convicted by the Senate because he was no longer actually president — the trial took place in February 2021 — but that the judicial system was the better venue anyway. “We have a judicial process in this country; we have an investigative process in this country to which no former officeholder is immune,” Trump attorney David Schoen  . “That is … the appropriate one for investigation, prosecution and punishment, with all of the attributes of that branch.” Schoen argued that the courts were best prepared to adjudicate such complex legal issues because Congress “does not and cannot offer the safeguards of the judicial system.” Fellow Trump lawyer Bruce Castor echoed the point at the time even more directly. “If my colleagues on this [Democratic] side of the chamber actually think that President Trump committed a criminal offense … after he is out of office, you go and arrest him,” Castor said. Henderson pointed to Trump’s lawyers arguing in another case that the version of immunity they sought then “would expire when the president leaves office” and would not “place the president ‘above the law.’” A Trump lawyer in that case   that “as the text of the Constitution makes clear, the president like all other citizens is subject to the laws and jurisdiction of states and the federal government alike.” Just because some Trump lawyers argue one thing and another argues something else doesn’t mean the latter doesn’t have a valid legal argument. Sauer argued that he wasn’t bound by what Trump’s lawyers said previously. (He also gamely sought to differentiate between the judicial system  a former president and actually  him.) But Pan didn’t just suggest that this evolution was thoroughly convenient; she also suggested it had real consequences. She posited that Trump might have avoided the impeachment conviction that would supposedly be a prerequisite today precisely  of the argument his lawyers now disown. “In fact, the argument was there’s no need to vote for impeachment because we have this backstop, which is criminal prosecution,” Pan said, “and it seems that many senators relied on that in voting to acquit.” Sauer contended it was speculative to surmise why the senators voted how they did. But the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell (Ky.), expressly   in announcing his acquittal vote. And a potentially decisive number of GOP senators said they voted to acquit because they argued Trump, as a then-former president, was   from office. In other words, the GOP senators suggested it wasn’t even legally possible to deliver the supposed prerequisite for a criminal prosecution that Trump’s lawyers now contend is necessary. And they did so by adopting his lawyers’ rationale. As that example shows, such immunity would open up the possibility that a president could do whatever he wanted in his final days in office, with the knowledge that there wouldn’t be sufficient time for Congress to impeach and convict him. Trump impeachment lawyer Castor, as it happens, directly addressed such a situation back in February 2021. “So there is no opportunity where the president of the United States can run rampant into January, the end of his term, and just go away scot-free,” Castor said. “The Department of Justice does know what to do with such people.” Trump’s new lawyer now effectively argues that what the Justice Department can do with such people is effectively this: nothing.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVMMGGDLBOFCZB7PFWP6Y6MZQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVMMGGDLBOFCZB7PFWP6Y6MZQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVMMGGDLBOFCZB7PFWP6Y6MZQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVMMGGDLBOFCZB7PFWP6Y6MZQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVMMGGDLBOFCZB7PFWP6Y6MZQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IVMMGGDLBOFCZB7PFWP6Y6MZQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/trump-immunity-flip-flops/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 15:27:00,

But   of the Republican primary in New Hampshire   shows that Haley has largely closed the gap with Trump, pulling to within seven points. It’s a weird divergence in polling, one that is easy to prompt observers to throw up their hands in confusion. A closer look at the results, though, shows that the results are actually reconcilable — and may actually be cause for additional confidence in how pollsters do their work. Let’s start with  , published by CNN in partnership with the University of New Hampshire. We can visualize the top-line results and the specific demographic results by presenting them on a radar plot, a type of graph that shows data as the distance from a center point. Here’s the CNN result, with results by gender, party and education broken out. You can see that Trump’s (magenta blob) lead over Haley (green blob) is fairly consistent by gender, as the magenta blob extends past the green one along the “men” and “women” spokes to an equal distance. Where there’s a split, it’s in the support from registered Republicans; Haley does better with independents. There’s also a big divide by education, as has long been the case: Voters with less education are more supportive of Trump. We can also compare these results to the previous CNN-UNH poll, released in November. On the chart below, you can see that there has been a slight contraction in Trump’s support; the yellowish blob extends farther along most spokes than does the current magenta one. For Haley, the opposite is true. Her support has extended outward among most demographic groups. Her blob has grown, you could say. The opposite effect is visible in Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s stumbling effort. His blob, already small two months ago, has nearly blinked out of existence. So that’s CNN. Now consider the results from   that has Trump up by 20. You can see below that Trump’s support is generally much wider than Haley’s, with the exceptions of partisanship and ideology. Haley is the choice of more moderate primary voters. Comparing the new result to a USA Today-Suffolk University poll in the state released in October, we see that Trump’s shift looks a lot like the one from CNN. His support has contracted — a little. Haley’s support, meanwhile, has expanded. So how do we reconcile the differences between the two polls? Well, let’s consider how Trump fares in the demographic groups that are included in both of the new polls. The USA Today poll (yellow blob) shows him with more support across those groups than he gets in CNN’s (blue blob). The opposite is true for Haley. A useful thing to remember, though, is that the top-line percentages aren’t the best way to think about poll results. There’s a built-in uncertainty to the numbers, most obviously measured in the poll’s margin of error. The overall results in the CNN poll have a margin of error of 3.2 points; for USA Today, it’s 4.4 points. If we apply those margins of error to the results for Trump in each poll, the results look like this. Notice that, both overall and for most demographic groups, the yellow and blue areas overlap. That means that among those groups, there’s no statistical difference between the two polls’ results. If Trump’s support in New Hampshire is really 42 percent — setting aside the vagueness of this concept for a moment — it’s within the lower bound of USA Today’s poll and the upper one from CNN. Why are there still demographic results where there’s a gap showing a difference that is outside the margins of error? Probably in large part because we’re applying the   margin of error to subgroups. The fewer people you interview, the higher your margin of error, and since, say, 18- to 34-year-olds make up only a fraction of the overall group of respondents, the margin of error for them is much higher. There may be other factors at play, of course, including that the pollsters may be making different decisions about who’s likely to vote or who should be included in the poll results. Polling involves some measure of interpretation. If we do the same consideration of margins of error for Haley’s results, you see that her support is generally within the margin-of-error ranges. The USA Today and CNN results for her overall support, like Trump’s, have a shared range. If she “really” has the support of 29 percent of primary voters, both polls are accurate. In fact, this is what we want to see in polls, particularly as Election Day nears. We want a range of poll results from different pollsters applying different theories of who will vote and how the results should be weighted. More polls means that averages of polls will be more accurate, and will better inform expectations. Yes, it is confusing. But, no, it’s not a sign that polling is broken.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J55RVBX4LDAHJQQLINIVIIB32U.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J55RVBX4LDAHJQQLINIVIIB32U.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J55RVBX4LDAHJQQLINIVIIB32U.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J55RVBX4LDAHJQQLINIVIIB32U.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J55RVBX4LDAHJQQLINIVIIB32U.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J55RVBX4LDAHJQQLINIVIIB32U.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/09/new-hampshire-polls-trump-haley/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 16:56:00,

Aaron Rodgers returned to ESPN’s airwaves on Tuesday, saying he did not call late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel a pedophile and reiterating his skepticism of vaccines, turning his weekly appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” into another bizarre chapter in the drama consuming the network. The segment, which aired live on Tuesday afternoon, included a 20-minute defense of his vaccine-skeptic worldview that touched on anti-malarial drug use in Africa and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s book about covid, all coming on an otherwise football-obsessed program the day after the University of Michigan  . “I totally understand how serious an allegation of pedophilia would be,” Rodgers said. “For him to be upset about that? I get it. Did you watch the quote?” Rodgers added, “I’m not stupid enough to accuse you of that with absolutely zero concrete evidence.” Rodgers spoke virtually uninterrupted by McAfee and took issue with the news media’s interpretation of his comments that made national news last week. “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, that are really hoping that [list] doesn’t come out,” he said last Tuesday, a quote that was widely interpreted to imply a connection between the serial abuser Jeffrey Epstein and Kimmel. That segment plunged McAfee’s show, and ESPN, into a week of chaos that included McAfee publicly   and Kimmel dedicating his opening monologue Monday night to Rodgers. “This is the game plan of the media,” Rodgers said Tuesday. “They try and cancel, and it’s not just me. … If you look at all the different people who’ve been censored from the internet, especially during covid, the canceling that went on, the censoring, using the government to try and censor people.” Rodgers’s response came a day after Kimmel delivered a 7-minute roast of the Jets quarterback, calling Rodgers “too arrogant to know how ignorant he is.” “I’ve seen guys like him before,” Kimmel said on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” adding that Rodgers “genuinely thinks that because God gave him the ability to throw a ball, he’s smarter than everybody else. The idea that his brain is just average is unfathomable to him. We learned during covid somehow he knows more about science than scientists.” Kimmel continued: “A guy who went to community college, then got into Cal on a football scholarship, and didn’t graduate. Someone who never spent a minute studying the human body is an expert in the field of immunology. He just put on a magic [Green Bay Packers] helmet and that ‘G’ made him a genius.” Rodgers’s comments Tuesday were part of a rambling and scattershot segment that took ESPN away from the major sports stories of the day — Michigan’s championship and NFL coaching firings. The company likes to say it serves sports fans “anytime, anywhere” and spent the Trump era trying to reestablish its apolitical brand. Rodgers’s exhaustive discussion of the efficacy of masking and anti-viral medications like Remdesivir were anything but. His appearance also represented the latest volley between the quarterback and the late-night host, with McAfee playing a starring role, too. Kimmel   after the initial comments, which prompted ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro to reach out to Kimmel to smooth things over last week. (Kimmel at ABC and McAfee at ESPN both work for the same parent company, Disney; ESPN licenses the show from McAfee.) McAfee  , saying he understood Kimmel’s anger but that Rodgers was just talking “s---.” ESPN executive Mike Foss told The Washington Post last week that Rodgers’s “joke” was “deeply dumb and factually inaccurate” and “should never have happened.” Rodgers on Tuesday addressed Foss by name, saying he didn’t understand those comments. “Mike, you’re not helping,” Rodgers said, later adding, “I don’t work for you.” The fallout from the original Rodgers comments continued last Friday when McAfee blasted a high-level ESPN executive by name, accusing Norby Williamson of “sabotaging” his show because of a report in the New York Post that flagged lagging linear TV ratings of McAfee’s show. That was followed by a cryptic tweet by McAfee over the weekend that seemed to compare himself to Tony Montana, the lead character of “Scarface,” and ESPN releasing a statement that it would handle the matter internally. McAfee doubled down on Monday, saying he didn’t regret his accusations against Williamson, although he said he had a strong relationship with other ESPN executives. The turmoil has caused many current and former ESPN employees to wonder about McAfee’s net value to the company — he earns a reported $15 million a year — as well as how the sports giant polices its star talent. Foss told The Post that McAfee’s digital popularity is key to the network’s future. On Tuesday, both McAfee and Rodgers said they hoped everyone could now move on from the Kimmel-Epstein story. If Rodgers were to apologize, Kimmel said, he would “accept his apology and move on.”  to the Jets the day before the appearance with McAfee. “Flush the bulls---,” he said, urging teammates who had voted him the team’s most inspiring player to eliminate distractions that had nothing to do with winning.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AG5KNXMEILKDCT6KKFQ7ZOYKHM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AG5KNXMEILKDCT6KKFQ7ZOYKHM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AG5KNXMEILKDCT6KKFQ7ZOYKHM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AG5KNXMEILKDCT6KKFQ7ZOYKHM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AG5KNXMEILKDCT6KKFQ7ZOYKHM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AG5KNXMEILKDCT6KKFQ7ZOYKHM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/09/aaron-rodgers-jimmy-kimmel/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 15:07:00,
"LAS VEGAS — If the past two years proved that generative artificial intelligence and large language models aren’t going anywhere, 2024 will be year they get embedded into products you may actually want to buy. To see the proof, start by looking to Las Vegas this week. CES, one of the largest technology trade shows in the world, will host thousands of engineers, entrepreneurs, dealmakers and tech companies in Nevada, all eager to share their visions of what’s next.

LAS VEGAS — If the past two years proved that generative artificial intelligence and large language models aren’t going anywhere, 2024 will be year they get embedded into products you may actually want to buy. To see the proof, start by looking to Las Vegas this week. CES, one of the largest technology trade shows in the world, will host thousands of engineers, entrepreneurs, dealmakers and tech companies in Nevada, all eager to share their visions of what’s next. And yes, AI looms larger over the show than ever before — though it’s not the   thing attendees will be talking about. It’s an intoxicating show to watch unfold, packed floor to ceiling with optimism, innovation and, yes, unfulfillable promises. But even the sprawling CES show floor can’t fully capture the seismic shifts in product and policy that will shape our relationship with technology this year. Here’s our guide to the tech trends we expect to see in 2024. Companies like Intel and Qualcomm are racing to make mainstream PCs designed to excel at AI features, powered by distinct “neural processing units” in their central processing units (CPUs). Microsoft, whose Windows software will run on those machines, recently mandated that new Windows PCs must include a dedicated AI button on their keyboards, for easier access to the   into Windows 11. Smartphones, which have for years used machine learning to improve our photos and make phone calls sound better, continue to lean into AI hype. Samsung, for instance, plans to launch new devices “powered by AI” right after CES. More interesting, though, are the upstarts looking past traditional smartphones to envision how a truly AI-first gadget should work. Humane, a California start-up with hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, is gearing up to release an AI-powered pin that engages you in conversations and projects data onto your hand. Another company, Rabbit, plans to show off this month a handheld device that can tackle  that Siri and Alexa wouldn’t know how to handle. Even at this early stage, the list of AI-powered products slated for a 2024 debut include cars, robots of all kinds, health and accessibility tools, and even electric bikes. Whether any of this stuff is worth using remains to be seen, but be ready to hear about AI gadgets for the rest of the year — and surely beyond. We’re not saying 2024 is the year everyone will rush to buy their own fancy headset. But it is the year we’ll start to see Big Tech push a more complete vision of what virtual reality, mixed reality and augmented reality will make possible for us. The elephant in the room is Apple. The company last year offered a first glimpse of the $3,499 headset it hopes will change the way we consume media and get work done. As the company prepares a launch expected before spring, two questions have yet to be answered: Can Apple make a mixed-reality headset that people will want to use? And what happens to the entire spatial computing movement if it can’t? Of course, Apple isn’t the only company charting a course into “spatial” computing. Samsung and Google announced a partnership last year to work on headsets. Meanwhile, chipmaker Qualcomm keeps churning out updated versions of its XR processors that offer ever-higher resolutions (to put more detailed images in front of your eyes) and support more cameras (to better track eyes, hands and the world around the wearer) for use by the Samsungs, Googles and Metas of the world — not to mention the many smaller companies itching for a bit of attention in Las Vegas. We’re not expecting to run into many election officials at the Las Vegas Convention Center, but all the same: Get ready to hear a lot about AI in the run-up to November. The dire potential of pervasive AI tools in an election year is clear: Misinformation by way of deepfakes, or artificial video and images, and misleading, AI-generated news articles could help deepen political divides, throw campaigns into disarray and poison people’s perception of legitimate reporting. “Wide-spread circulation of manufactured content may undermine voters’ trust in the broader information environment,” says   produced by researchers at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “If voters come to believe that they cannot trust any digital evidence, it becomes difficult to seriously evaluate those who seek to represent them.” But some seemingly benign uses of AI could affect the way you hear from — and learn about — lawmakers and candidates. Projects like Chat2024, developed by a Miami start-up called Delphi, let you pose questions to chatbots based on  , trained on their published statements and transcripts of video appearances. And at least one congressional candidate — Shamaine Daniels, a Pennsylvania Democrat — has begun to use an AI robocaller developed by a company called Civox to engage thousands of potential voters in customized conversations. No gadget or AI can replace a qualified human doctor — though we wouldn’t be shocked to hear someone make that claim on the show floor. But of the early crop of health tech products appearing at CES, a surprising number of them promise to help track and tend to your well-being from the comfort of your home. Withings, which made waves last year when it exhibited a urine analyzer, has developed a multifunction device that lets people take their temperature, check their blood oxygen levels, and measure and store results from a digital stethoscope. Other companies plan to show off surprisingly sophisticated sensors, like wireless ear buds that are said to track a person’s heart health with clinical accuracy in addition to playing podcasts. Some projects are meant to help people with more personal health issues. One start-up based in Ireland plans to release a wearable sensor that tracks the frequency and severity of menopause symptoms, while another from South Korea claims to have developed a gadget that will increase a wearer’s sperm motility. How well products like these actually work is nearly impossible to gauge at a trade show, but one thing seems clear: Tech companies are keen to dig into issues that haven’t always received a fair share of the limelight. We’ll start to see how the ways we interact with tech titans could change in response to antitrust pressure. Jurors in the  , for instance, found that the search giant — which maintains the Android operating system used by billions of mobile devices around the world — operated its Google Play app store as a monopoly. It’s not yet clear what remedies the court will devise, but it’s possible that Google will have to allow Android users more access to competing app stores. In time, that could mean you’ll have to browse multiple stores to find the software you want to use. Apple may face a similar fate thanks to the European Commission, which some observers expect to require the company to let users “sideload,” or manually install, apps downloaded from outside the App Store. Other antitrust cases loom large. The Justice Department and several states are   over allegations that it illegally stifles competition in search, and closing arguments are expected to be heard in May. The Federal Trade Commission is waging a legal battle with Amazon over concerns that the commerce giant harms sellers and shoppers by “depriving them of the benefits of open, fair competition.” (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Satellite phone networks have been around for decades, but the idea of regular folks connecting to satellites only entered the mainstream in recent years with Apple’s iPhone, mostly in case of  . But in 2024, some companies are getting closer to making other kinds of practical satellite connections a reality. Earlier this month, Elon Musk’s SpaceX launched the first six satellites designed to double as orbiting cell towers, signaling a potential end to the age of the cellular dead zone. The idea, as Musk first explained in 2022, is to enable regular smartphones — like those offered by cellular partner T-Mobile — to send and receive text messages from anywhere in the world starting this year. The two companies eventually hope to offer voice calls and even data connections, but probably not until 2025 at the earliest. Meanwhile, Amazon — which aims to build its own global, satellite-based broadband internet service to compete with Musk’s Starlink — cleared a crucial hurdle in late December when it successfully forged a stable, high-speed data connection between two test satellites. The company plans to build enough of an orbiting fleet over the next several months to start trials with customers possible later this year.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KT5W4OUOHJHBFDVJ6FQS4EKZK4.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KT5W4OUOHJHBFDVJ6FQS4EKZK4.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KT5W4OUOHJHBFDVJ6FQS4EKZK4.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KT5W4OUOHJHBFDVJ6FQS4EKZK4.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KT5W4OUOHJHBFDVJ6FQS4EKZK4.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KT5W4OUOHJHBFDVJ6FQS4EKZK4.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/08/tech-trends-2024/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 08:45:00,
"For teams that never had much chance at Shohei Ohtani and even for those who did, the defining feature of this baseball offseason has been the frantic and expensive scramble to secure starting pitching. From the top of the market to the bottom, the prices have been stunning. Yoshinobu Yamamoto, a 25-year-old Japanese right-hander who has yet to throw a pitch in Major League Baseball,  . Frankie Montas, who has never made an all-star team and missed most of the past year and a half with major injury issues,   annually from the Cincinnati Reds.

Lucas Giolito, who has shown ace capabilities but struggled in 2023, signed a deal with the Boston Red Sox that will pay him nearly $20 million in 2024. Former Washington National Erick Fedde, who never quite figured things out in the majors and   for his age-30 season, returned from a strong year there to find multiple teams — some of them postseason contenders — pursuing him. Ultimately, the Chicago White Sox  , hoping he can emerge as a reliable back-of-the-rotation starter at what is, in this free agent market, a relatively low price. The trade market, while largely still evolving, has not yielded many steals, either. Friday afternoon, for example, the San Francisco Giants gave up middle-of-the-order bat Mitch Haniger and an established swingman in Anthony DeSclafani  . The thing about Ray, however, is that he is not able to pitch until August because of an injury, and his contract includes an opt-out after next season. While stunning in some ways, the competitive market did not exactly surprise those looking for upgrades. From the moment general managers convened in Scottsdale, Ariz., for their annual meetings a few days after the World Series, they were clear-eyed about the market and the forces pushing prices higher. An expanded postseason means more teams are “going for it” than ever,  . Plus, the increased emphasis on high velocity and the need to hurry for the pitch clock combined to send a staggering number of starters to the injured list last year; having five good starters is no longer enough. Betting on an entire rotation to stay healthy these days amounts to negligence, particularly for teams that regularly appear in the postseason and therefore add a month’s worth of high-stress innings to their starters’ arms. The team that stockpiled starting pitching like no other last year, the Texas Rangers, ended up   with two of the best starting pitchers of their generation unavailable because of injury. Had the Rangers signed even one fewer starter or traded for one fewer at the deadline, they might have fallen off, too. Now, with just over a month until pitchers and catchers report to spring training, the market could escalate even further. Blake Snell, the 2023 National League Cy Young winner, could command more than $200 million. Japanese lefty Shota Imanaga, who showed well against MLB stars in the World Baseball Classic last year but was not nearly as decorated in the Japanese major leagues as Yamamoto, could reasonably secure nine figures. Lefty Jordan Montgomery, who emerged as a playoff hero for the Rangers but had never before resembled an ace, could expect the same. Massive pitching contracts have always been huge gambles, rarely yielding full value for their entire extents. But in this year’s market, they are necessities. Given that, the trade market probably will become an increasingly appealing option to teams hunting starting pitching without the financial wherewithal — perceived or real — to take on such risk. Elias’s Orioles, for example, have yet to address their obvious need for established starting pitching. The Miami Marlins might have young pitchers to spare. The White Sox continue to listen on lefty Dylan Cease, who will be a free agent after the 2025 season, and the Milwaukee Brewers could decide to offload ace Corbin Burnes, who is a free agent after this season. But with so many teams still needing starters, affordable ones who have yet to hit free agency will command massive prospect costs, if not the surrender of legitimate big league talent. The Atlanta Braves surrendered a major league-ready top prospect in   last week, hoping he will return to form. Getting a younger, healthier, cheaper pitcher such as Cease or anyone on the Marlins’ staff almost certainly will cost as much, if not more. Plus, almost everyone who needed starting pitching when the offseason began — except, perhaps, the Los Angeles Dodgers — still needs it. The Yankees, Red Sox, Mets,  , Padres, Cubs, Angels, Giants and others could use more help. The Seattle Mariners, who have a cache of young starters, seem unlikely to trade them now after their head of baseball operations, Jerry Dipoto, indicated Friday that the reason the Mariners traded Ray was that they didn’t think pulling from those young arms was worth it. The Brewers, who do not seem determined to deal Burnes, can hold out for whatever price they want before making that decision. The options are dwindling, but the number of suitors is not, meaning the most competitive starting pitching market in recent years is not likely to become much friendlier.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKXZDXRI4MI63KIK7TSACXP4R4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKXZDXRI4MI63KIK7TSACXP4R4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKXZDXRI4MI63KIK7TSACXP4R4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKXZDXRI4MI63KIK7TSACXP4R4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKXZDXRI4MI63KIK7TSACXP4R4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WKXZDXRI4MI63KIK7TSACXP4R4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/06/mlb-starting-pitching-expensive/,Washington Post,2024-01-06 11:06:00,
"RICHMOND — Democratic lawmakers have the majorities. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has the veto. That’s the crux as a new-look Virginia General Assembly rolls into town Wednesday, opening a 60-day legislative session in which roughly a third of lawmakers are rookies and Democrats control both chambers but can’t get much done without Youngkin’s cooperation. RICHMOND — Democratic lawmakers have the majorities. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has the veto. That’s the crux as a new-look Virginia General Assembly rolls into town Wednesday, opening a 60-day legislative session in which roughly a third of lawmakers are rookies and Democrats control both chambers but can’t get much done without Youngkin’s cooperation. The two-seat majorities that Democrats won last fall in the House of Delegates and state Senate are too slim to overcome Youngkin’s veto pen, so it’s going to take compromise to get much more than partisan fireworks out of this year’s session. Yet there are a few big-ticket items that need to be resolved — and that could define Youngkin’s legacy as governor. Flashiest is the   at the Potomac Yard site in Alexandria for the Washington Capitals and Wizards, which Youngkin unveiled in December. His call for an estimated $1.35 billion in state and local funds to support team owner Ted Leonsis and his Monumental Sports & Entertainment organization would be the  . Even bigger than the arena — if less sexy — is the  , a two-year spending plan that offers Youngkin his broadest chance to make a lasting impact on state government. Democrats could be on board with a host of his spending priorities, but there will be fights about taxes — and maybe not in the way one might expect. Youngkin, the red-vest-wearing conservative, has proposed several tax increases that are shaking up lawmakers in both parties. How the conflict plays out will be another factor to keep an eye on, because many of the major players have changed and new dynamics of status and influence are just taking shape. Both the House of Delegates and the state Senate will sport new leadership, with African American lawmakers wielding historic power in a legislature that is more diverse than ever. Del. Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) is poised to become the first Black speaker of the House in Virginia history, and Del. Charniele L. Herring (D-Alexandria) will reprise her role as the first Black woman to serve as House majority leader. On the Senate side, Black women will also hold top positions — with Sen. L. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth) as both president pro tempore and chairwoman of the Finance and Appropriations Committee and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears (R) continuing to preside over daily sessions. And in a significant generational change, Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax)   after members representing decades of experience left through retirements, redistricting and election losses. “In the Senate, I went from being the third-youngest member to being the 11th at age 52,” Surovell said. “I can tell you this: Our basketball team’s going to be a lot better.” Here are some highlights of the upcoming session. The hottest topic is likely to be the proposed arena for the Wizards and Capitals. The project promises to bring two major professional sports teams to a state with none — and give rise to a $2 billion 12-acre mixed-use complex that will also include a concert hall, underground parking, a conference center, a Wizards practice facility, and Monumental’s corporate offices and media studio. To make it happen, Youngkin needs the General Assembly to approve legislation creating a sports and entertainment authority, which would have the power to issue a total of nearly $1.5 billion in bonds for the project. The bonds would be paid back with a combination of tax receipts from the project, parking revenue, rent payments from Monumental and the proceeds from the eventual sale of naming rights for the sports and entertainment district, though not for the arena itself. Monumental would get to sell the more lucrative arena naming rights. Language accomplishing this is included in bills that adjust the final months of the state budget that runs through the end of June. Virginia also would make an upfront investment of $150 million to $200 million of redirected existing transportation funds, through a separate agreement between Virginia and Alexandria that has yet to be negotiated. Youngkin has downplayed taxpayers’ contributions, contending that the transportation upgrades will be needed regardless of what is built there and that the tax revenue forfeited for the bonds would not exist without the development. The governor will need to convince lawmakers from around the state that the investment is beneficial to everyone, not just wealthy areas of Northern Virginia. Some attempts at horse-trading have already played out in unusually public fashion. “Anyone who thinks I am going to approve an arena in Northern Virginia using state tax dollars before we deliver on toll relief and for public schools in Hampton Roads must think I have dumbass written on my forehead,” Lucas, the Portsmouth senator who will have great sway over the state’s purse strings,  , formerly known as Twitter. In an earlier post, Lucas suggested that she wouldn’t be on board without a fix to the state’s marijuana laws, which make adult possession legal but provide no mechanism for legal sales. Youngkin has been pushing for tax cuts since he ran for governor in 2021, but he caught many lawmakers off guard in this budget by calling for tax increases in addition to further cuts. Most Republican legislators only learned of the tax plan the night before Youngkin unveiled it in December, when he told them about it in a conference call, according to two people involved who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private caucus deliberations. His aim, Youngkin said when presenting the plan to legislative committees, is to shift taxation so that it’s aimed less at what people make and more at what they spend. Youngkin and his advisers say this would create a more reliable revenue stream for the state while allowing residents to keep more of what they earn. He said it’s the approach taken in states to the south, such as North Carolina and Tennessee, which he insists are wooing more businesses and residents than Virginia. The proposal features what the administration says would be a 12 percent cut in personal income tax rates, aimed at every bracket. That would come on top of $4 billion in tax cuts approved by the General Assembly in 2022 and $1 billion in one-time tax rebates approved last year. To help offset the loss in state revenue, Youngkin’s budget proposes increasing the state’s portion of the sales tax to 5.2 percent from 4.3 percent (localities can tack on an additional percentage point). Youngkin acknowledged in remarks to reporters after his December budget presentation that a higher sales tax would be a burden on people with low incomes and said he is proposing to increase the earned income tax credit to help ease that pain. In addition, Youngkin said he has a goal — not included in the budget plan — of eliminating Virginia’s car tax, which generates revenue for localities. He would ask the General Assembly to authorize increases in local sales taxes to make up for the lost revenue. Scott, the incoming speaker, joked that Youngkin’s unexpected play for tax hikes meant he was entering the second half of his term as a Democrat. But Democrats say the governor’s plan shifts the tax burden off the wealthy and onto those with lower incomes. The Commonwealth Institute, a left-leaning economic policy think tank in Richmond, said an analysis of Youngkin’s tax proposals done with the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy showed that the wealthy would benefit far more than anyone else. The income tax cuts and sales tax hike — not including an expansion of the sales tax to digital goods that Youngkin also proposed — would leave the bottom 20 percent of income earners paying an average of $44 more in taxes per year, while the top 1 percent would pay about $9,600 less, according to the analysis. The analysis found that the sales tax increase would hurt low-income people more than the income tax cuts would help them, partly because they spend far more of their resources on necessities. While the bottom 10 percent of earners would get a 0.9 percent share of the overall cut in income taxes, they would pay a 6.5 percent share of the increase in sales tax. The wealthiest 1 percent, on the other hand, would get 20.1 percent of the benefit of cutting taxes but pay 4.7 percent of the overall sales tax increase, according to the analysis. Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez defended the plan, noting that the governor has already delivered $5 billion in tax relief over the past two years, including   and nearly doubling the standard deduction. “His proposed budget outlines a plan to reduce costs for all Virginia taxpayers by cutting tax rates across the board,” Martinez said via text message. He added that Youngkin’s proposal to increase the nonrefundable portion of the earned income tax credit would ensure “low-income filers can receive a refund even with minimal or no tax liability. The net effect of all tax actions signed or currently proposed by Governor Youngkin is to make Virginia’s tax code fairer and more competitive.” Reviews of the plan have been harsh, even from some fellow Republicans. State Sen. William M. Stanley Jr. (R-Franklin) told  that Youngkin’s proposal to hike the sales tax, eliminate the car tax and cut education funding will hurt the state, especially in rural areas that propelled him to the Executive Mansion. “Areas that helped get the governor elected are being left on the side of the road,” Stanley said. “Fundamentally unserious” is how state Sen. Adam Ebbin (D-Alexandria) described Youngkin’s budget plan in a newsletter emailed to constituents. He faulted Youngkin for seeking to cut taxes in a way that would predominantly benefit “Virginia’s wealthiest residents” — and to do it by hiking the regressive sales tax and cutting spending for critical investments, such as public education. “The budget he proposed was filled with a bunch of revenue gimmicks and sleights of hand to make it appear it was balanced,” said Surovell, the incoming Senate majority leader. “The reality is, we’re going to have to start from square one in writing a budget.” No matter the Capitol’s partisan split, there are always areas of cooperation. Legislators on both sides of the aisle typically tout their support for K-12 education, veterans, mental health services and economic development, though they might squabble over policy details. One area of dispute is already taking shape: Some Democrats and education advocates criticized Youngkin’s proposed budget for using specialized funds for basic education costs, rather than pulling from the general fund. For example, the budget would take money from the Literary Fund, which funds school construction and infrastructure projects, to pay teacher retirement, according to an analysis by Laura Goren of the Commonwealth Institute. Youngkin’s proposal also uses expected increased revenue from the state lottery instead of general fund money for education funding. Goren said the proposal means the total state general fund support for public schools will be lower in the upcoming two years than the current funding levels by about $300 million. Martinez, Youngkin’s spokesman, defended the funding and said previous administrations have also tapped lottery and literary funds in this way. “There is no reduction in direct aid for public education,” Martinez said. Funding has been a central conversation in Virginia education after a report release last summer by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), a watchdog for state lawmakers in the General Assembly, found that Virginia’s schools were underfunded compared with nearby states. Scott Brabrand, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents, said that the governor’s budget proposal fell short of implementing more recommendations from the JLARC report and that he hopes to see more funding across the board during the legislative session to make up for those pitfalls. “It’s a start, but there’s more that needs to be done,” he said of the budget. “We will be looking for a final budget that fully embraces the JLARC recommendations.” With Democrats in charge of both chambers, this session will give them the chance to send all manner of  to Youngkin’s desk. While they lack the numbers to override any vetoes, Democrats could force Youngkin to take a stand on certain issues he’s largely sidestepped, such as  , marijuana, gambling and same-sex marriage. Ebbin has a bill, for instance, establishing that no one authorized to issue marriage licenses may deny them on the basis of the couple’s sex, gender or race. It also provides that religious organizations have the right to refuse to perform any marriage. Youngkin has waged  , but he has largely ducked questions about same-sex marriage. Pressed for his stance in a July 2022 interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Youngkin   that same-sex marriage rights would be secure in Virginia regardless of whether the U.S. Supreme Court reverses its   nationwide. In fact, a defunct ban on those unions in the Virginia Constitution would become operative again if the high court were to reverse itself. Democrats have introduced a state constitutional amendment to remove the language banning same-sex marriages. Amendments do not require action by the governor, but they have to be passed a second time during a legislative session following another state election — so anything passed this year could not be put to the voters before 2026. Democrats have also introduced proposed amendments to automatically restore voting rights to people convicted of felonies and to enshrine protections for access to  .","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQSMWWO3XBDCDVB455GMPVVLIY.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQSMWWO3XBDCDVB455GMPVVLIY.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQSMWWO3XBDCDVB455GMPVVLIY.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQSMWWO3XBDCDVB455GMPVVLIY.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQSMWWO3XBDCDVB455GMPVVLIY.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GQSMWWO3XBDCDVB455GMPVVLIY.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/07/virginia-youngkin-assembly-arena-taxes-session-begins/,Washington Post,2024-01-07 06:00:00,

Biden delivered a speech Friday marking the third anniversary of the  , 2021, insurrection and pitching Trump as a  . On Monday, he spoke at the historically Black church in South Carolina that was the site of a racist massacre and accused . These and other Biden campaign events spotlight one of the biggest questions of the 2024 race, as general-election polls lean in Trump’s direction and Biden lags with such key groups as young and Black voters: Can Biden lure people to vote  Trump — if not necessarily  Biden — as they did in 2020? He plainly needs to. Multiple polls have shown enthusiasm for Biden’s candidacy at a low point. A   last week asked primary voters from each party to rate how enthusiastic they were to vote for their respective front-runners, Biden and Trump, if they became the nominee. While 44 percent of GOP primary voters gave Trump a 10 (“very enthusiastic”), just 18 percent of Democratic primary voters gave Biden a 10. Nearly half of Democratic primary voters were at a 6 or lower. An   last month showed 65 percent of Republicans were “very” or “somewhat” satisfied with Trump as their nominee, compared with 49 percent when it came to Democrats and Biden. (Independents were also less satisfied with Biden as the Democratic nominee than they were with Trump as the GOP nominee.) A   in September showed 47 percent of Republicans were “very enthusiastic” about Trump, compared with 29 percent of Democrats who were “very enthusiastic” about Biden. The other poll that really drives this home is from November.   asked those planning to vote for Biden whether their vote was more  him or  Trump. Just 31 percent said it was more for Biden, while twice as many — 63 percent — said it more against Trump That’s a brand of negative partisanship we simply haven’t seen in the 21st century. In NBC polls dating to 2004, the lowest percentage to say they were mostly affirmatively voting for their party’s nominee was 35 percent in mid-2012. It was 36 percent for Biden in his 2020 matchup with Trump in an August 2020 NBC poll. One way to look at this is that Biden still won in 2020. The bogeyman that was Trump proved to be just  compelling. But the contest was  . Also, with Trump’s presidency four years behind us, it’s a tougher trick to rely on people voting so strongly against him (memories fade), when you’re the incumbent with a record, and when voters find you less palatable. (Biden’s favorable rating in exit polls on Election Day 2020 was 52 percent, compared with   today.) Because of the impact of negative partisanship, polls generally show the percentage of Democrats and Republicans who say they’ll definitely vote is closer than the above numbers indicate. But Democrats have generally lagged on that, too. And a recent   showed 60 percent of Republicans said they were “very enthusiastic” about voting in the 2024 election, compared with 38 percent of Democrats. None of that means Biden can’t win with this setup. Part of the reason enthusiasm might be higher on the GOP side is that Republicans actually have a semi-competitive primary in which Trump supporters are being asked to cast crucial votes. Biden hasn’t had to run an active campaign to lock up the Democratic nomination. And, certainly, there could be plenty to remind people about what they didn’t like about Trump’s presidency if and when his criminal cases go to trial. But, certainly, Biden having such a limited segment of his party excited to vote for him 10 months before the election is far from ideal.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2XMPDLIKIS3XDJTJXLGA2BF7HA.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2XMPDLIKIS3XDJTJXLGA2BF7HA.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2XMPDLIKIS3XDJTJXLGA2BF7HA.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2XMPDLIKIS3XDJTJXLGA2BF7HA.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2XMPDLIKIS3XDJTJXLGA2BF7HA.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2XMPDLIKIS3XDJTJXLGA2BF7HA.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/08/biden-enthusiasm-gap/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 17:03:00,
"The Tennessee Titans did not wait to see if they could receive compensation by trading their coach, Mike Vrabel, to another team. They provided the first surprise of the NFL’s firing cycle by dismissing Vrabel on Tuesday after their second straight losing season. Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk said in a statement that she informed Vrabel, the 2021 NFL coach of the year, of her “decision to make a change at head coach.” She said the decision “was as difficult as any I’ve made” as the franchise’s controlling owner. The Tennessee Titans did not wait to see if they could receive compensation by trading their coach, Mike Vrabel, to another team. They provided the first surprise of the NFL’s firing cycle by dismissing Vrabel on Tuesday after their second straight losing season. Titans owner Amy Adams Strunk said in a statement that she informed Vrabel, the 2021 NFL coach of the year, of her “decision to make a change at head coach.” She said the decision “was as difficult as any I’ve made” as the franchise’s controlling owner. “I appreciate Mike’s contributions to the Tennessee Titans both on and off the field,” Strunk said. “Anyone who has ever met him knows how passionate and genuine he is, and he’s been a strong supporter of the Nashville community.” The Titans went a combined 13-21 over the past two seasons after having four straight winning seasons under Vrabel. Overall, he led the Titans to a 54-45 record and three playoff appearances over six seasons. They reached the AFC championship game in the 2019 season, Vrabel’s second year. There had been speculation that the New England Patriots could seek to hire Vrabel, in what would have amounted to a trade with Tennessee, as a potential replacement for Bill Belichick. Vrabel is a former Patriots linebacker. Now he could be a leading candidate to replace Belichick without the Patriots needing to provide draft pick compensation to the Titans.  part ways with head coach Mike Vrabel Vrabel also becomes an intriguing candidate for any other team with a vacancy. The Titans join the Las Vegas Raiders, Carolina Panthers, Los Angeles Chargers, Atlanta Falcons and Washington Commanders in searching for new head coaches. “I believe the Tennessee Titans can and will be a premier National Football League franchise,” Strunk said. “It’s what our fans deserve, and there will be hard decisions along the way. My decision today is not only a reflection of my disappointment in our past two seasons, but also my recognition that further changes are necessary to fully achieve our vision.” The Titans beat the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday in Nashville to prevent the Jaguars from clinching the AFC South title and knock them from the playoffs. Even so, the Titans went 6-11 and finished last in the division. It was a transition season; rookie Will Levis took over for Ryan Tannehill as the starting quarterback. The team hired Ran Carthon last January as its general manager. Strunk said in her statement that she believes the teams “best positioned for sustained success will be those who empower an aligned and collaborative team across all football functions.” She said the Titans “began a shift in our approach to football leadership and made several changes to our personnel to advance that plan” last year, and she concluded that the team would benefit now from “the fresh approach and perspective” of a coaching change. “I will never shy away from acknowledging that I have unapologetically high expectations for the football team and every aspect of the Titans organization,” Strunk said. “Our vision is not simply to produce more wins than losses; it is to regularly compete for championships. While this season was disappointing, I see early signs of progress taking shape.” Interview with Amy Adams Strunk  Strunk said  posted to social media later Tuesday that a prospective trade of Vrabel to another team had been a consideration. But she pointed out that Vrabel would have had to participate willingly in such a transaction. “We thought about it,” Strunk said. “But at the end of the day, with league rules the way they are, it would have maybe put us back three weeks. And, you know, honestly, to get the right head coach, I was just not willing to go to the back of the line and take a chance of missing out on someone we really wanted.” New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said Monday that he would meet with team owner Robert Kraft, perhaps multiple times, to determine the franchise’s next steps following a 4-13 season. “It was obviously a very disappointing season all the way around — players, coaches, staff, organization, everybody,” Belichick said in a video news conference the day after a season-ending defeat to the New York Jets in Foxborough, Mass. “It’s not anywhere close to what our standard and expectations are. So obviously things need to be fixed.” The Patriots’ struggles have raised the question of whether Kraft will retain Belichick to continue coaching the team he has led to six Super Bowl titles. “I’m under contract,” Belichick said. “I’m going to do what I always do, which is every day I come in, work as hard as I can to help the team in whatever way I can.” Belichick said he could have a series of meetings with Kraft rather than just a single get-together. “We’ll start … putting the pieces back together in terms of setting things up to go through a good, detailed analysis and to kind of start a reconstruction, if you will,” Belichick said. He left open the possibility of relinquishing the control he possesses over the team’s roster. “I’m for whatever collectively we decide as an organization is the best thing to help our football team,” Belichick said. “I have multiple roles in that. And I rely on a lot of people to help me in those responsibilities. Somebody has got to have the final say. … Whatever that process is, I’m only part of it.” If Belichick and Kraft decide to part ways, Kraft could seek to receive draft-pick compensation from any other NFL team interested in hiring Belichick in what would amount to a trade. “I learned that lesson from my dad growing up: You work for the team you’re working for and do the best you can for them until somebody tells you different,” Belichick said Monday. “So that’s not going to change.” The Carolina Panthers extended the housecleaning of their top football decision-makers, firing Scott Fitterer as their general manager. The move comes after the Panthers lost Sunday to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to finish the season with an NFL-worst record of 2-15. They were shut out in each of their final two games, losing by a combined 35-0 to the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Buccaneers. “As we move forward with the new direction for our franchise, I have made the decision that Scott Fitterer will no longer serve as our general manager,” Panthers owner David Tepper said in a written statement. “I appreciate Scott’s efforts and wish the best for him and his family.” Tepper previously fired Frank Reich   with the team. So the Panthers will be searching for both a new general manager and a new head coach. Chris Tabor finished the season as the interim head coach. The Panthers hired Fitterer, who had spent 20 seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, as their GM in January 2021. The team went 14-37 in three seasons with Fitterer leading the front office. The Panthers won’t have the benefit of having the top choice in this year’s NFL draft. They traded that pick to the Chicago Bears as part of the   in the first-round order to select quarterback Bryce Young with the No. 1 choice in  . Young  , while C.J. Stroud, the No. 2 selection, immediately became a star and led the Houston Texans to the AFC South title. Tepper said during a news conference the day after he fired Reich that Panthers officials had been unanimous in their desire to pick Young and that he had supported that decision. The tumult of the Panthers’ season also included the   $300,000 after video posted to social media showed him throwing a drink toward fans in the stands in front of his suite at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville during the loss to the Jaguars. The sweeping changes that were expected following Josh Harris’s first season as owner of the Washington Commanders commenced Monday, as the team fired Ron Rivera  . The move had been widely expected. The Commanders completed a 4-13 season with Sunday’s 38-10 defeat to the Dallas Cowboys at FedEx Field. They will have the No. 2 selection in this year’s NFL draft. Rivera coached the Commanders for four seasons, going 26-40-1. He never led the Commanders to a winning season but, even at 7-9, won the NFC East title in the 2020 season. The NFL’s team owners   of the Commanders to Harris’s investment group on July 20, too late for the group to make major changes before the season. The new owners gave team president Jason Wright, members of the front office and Rivera the season  . The Atlanta Falcons again failed to turn at least a modest amount of promise into results, compelling them to fire coach Arthur Smith following the third losing season of his three-year tenure. Owner Arthur Blank made the move hours after the Falcons lost in lopsided fashion Sunday in New Orleans to miss the playoffs and finish 7-10. It was the Falcons’ third straight 7-10 season under Smith, who was hired after a stint as the offensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans. “Decisions like this are never easy and they never feel good,” Blank   released by the Falcons. “We have profound respect for Coach Smith and appreciate all the hard work and dedication he has put into the Falcons over the last three years. He has been part of building a good culture in our football team, but the results on the field have not met our expectations. After significant thought and reflection, we have determined the best way forward for our team is new leadership in the head coaching position.” The Falcons said the move was made at a meeting Sunday night in Atlanta involving Blank, Smith and Rich McKay, the team’s CEO. The season ended with Smith directing a profane tirade at Saints Coach Dennis Allen on the field following Sunday’s game. Smith was upset that the Saints   in their 48-17 win. Allen issued a public apology to Smith and the Falcons during his postgame news conference, saying Smith had the right to be upset. The Falcons entered Sunday with a chance to reach the playoffs. They would have won the NFC South, even with an 8-9 record, if they had beaten the Saints and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had lost to the Panthers. But the Buccaneers beat the Panthers to win the division at 9-8. Smith — the 41-year-old son of FedEx founder Fred Smith, a former limited partner in Washington’s NFL team — failed to get the Falcons back to the level they reached under his predecessor, Dan Quinn. The Falcons made the Super Bowl under Quinn in the 2016 season but squandered a 28-3 lead to lose to the Patriots in overtime, 34-28. The Falcons returned to the playoffs the following season but have not been back since. Smith did not resolve the Falcons’ quarterback situation after they traded Matt Ryan to the Indianapolis Colts in March 2022 following a failed bid to acquire Deshaun Watson. The Falcons attempted to establish second-year quarterback Desmond Ridder as their starter this season. But Ridder struggled, and backup Taylor Heinicke made four starts in a failed attempt to salvage the season. The Falcons said the search for Smith’s successor will be led by Blank and McKay and will include “input” from General Manager Terry Fontenot and “several other appropriate members of Blank’s Atlanta Falcons and AMB Sports and Entertainment organizations.” The Falcons and Commanders joined the Las Vegas Raiders, Panthers and Los Angeles Chargers in searching for new coaches. The Raiders, Panthers and Chargers fired their coaches during the season.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2C4E7HPXLIIBXMFTUPJILBJGFU_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2C4E7HPXLIIBXMFTUPJILBJGFU_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2C4E7HPXLIIBXMFTUPJILBJGFU_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2C4E7HPXLIIBXMFTUPJILBJGFU_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2C4E7HPXLIIBXMFTUPJILBJGFU_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2C4E7HPXLIIBXMFTUPJILBJGFU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/08/nfl-black-monday-firings/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 16:52:00,
"LAS VEGAS — CES, one of the world’s largest technology trade shows, has long featured individual gadgets that scoot in and out of rooms, control smart-home devices, or project streaming shows onto walls. Now Samsung is combining all of those capabilities into its next big bet — a spherical home robot called Ballie, aimed at charming skeptical consumers who need a little extra help around the house. LAS VEGAS — CES, one of the world’s largest technology trade shows, has long featured individual gadgets that scoot in and out of rooms, control smart-home devices, or project streaming shows onto walls. Now Samsung is combining all of those capabilities into its next big bet — a spherical home robot called Ballie, aimed at charming skeptical consumers who need a little extra help around the house. For years, Samsung has trotted out ostensibly helpful machines during its CES keynote addresses, including a  . But this updated model is the company’s first serious attempt at developing a home companion robot, not just a motorized appliance such as a clever vacuum cleaner. And Samsung says customers will be able to bring a bowling-ball-size Ballie home in 2024. “With the way things are progressing, I don’t see any big issue with reaching our goal of releasing it within this year,” Kang-il Chung, Samsung vice president and head of the company’s Future Planning group, told The Washington Post in an interview. Some key details of Samsung’s Ballie, including its cost, have yet to be finalized. Still, Samsung has ruled out subscription fees to access the robot’s full suite of features. Tuesday marks the official start of CES, where AI and robotics are expected to loom larger than ever. Samsung is facing competition in its bid to expand its robotic reach into people’s homes. In late December, rival LG also announced   — a roving, bipedal “AI Agent” that, in addition to controlling smart-home gadgets and gathering home temperature and air quality data, can “move, learn, comprehend and engage in complex conversations.” The company aims to release the AI Agent in 2025, said an LG spokesperson, who noted that timing is subject to change. These announcements signal a newfound optimism among major consumer tech companies that people are willing to welcome these machines into their households. But that’s no guarantee of success. For proof, look to other high-profile personal robotics projects: Amazon’s Astro robot, first introduced in 2021, was received as   than a  . The product remains largely unavailable to consumers. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Meanwhile, Softbank pushed Pepper, a humanoid robot with a tablet for a chest, for close to a decade before quietly winding down production in 2021. Jibo, a friendly machine with an expressive screen-face, was developed by the director of the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab — but it didn’t last, either. Ultimately, whether an investment in a home robot makes sense depends on what you would want out of one. Samsung, for example, built Ballie to do a little bit of everything. A spatial lidar sensor helps Ballie navigate rooms and obstacles as it patrols your home, while a built-in, 1080p projector with two lenses allows the robot to project movies, video calls and even greetings on surfaces near and far. (Chung says Ballie’s internal battery is meant to last for two to three hours of continued projector use, so it won’t die in the middle of a film.) A promotional video Samsung played during its keynote also showed Ballie using its projector as an additional screen for a nearby PC, though it’s not clear if this feature will be available at launch. While the robot is largely meant to be controlled with voice commands, you will also be able to send requests via text message when you’re out, such as “feed the dog and play its favorite video”; before taking action, Ballie will respond with the aid of a chatbot. Samsung also built Ballie to respond to the presence of members of your household. It can, for example, automatically turn on connected lights and — with help from an infrared transmitter — non-smart devices such as air conditioners when you walk through the front door. And because not all residents of a home will have the same sense of personal space, Chung says, Ballie will pick up on their preferences so it can cuddle up to some while giving others a wider berth. Perhaps the most important role Samsung hopes Ballie will fill is that of a catchall home caretaker. Beyond keeping tabs on your pets, Chung says the robot will “make sure you are giving water to your plants at the right interval.” To some degree, he also considers Ballie a potentially potent tool for senior care, alluding to features that allow the robot to offer “greater access” to remote medical services. This is, obviously, a lot for a single device to accomplish, and a gulf between promise and execution could significantly set back Samsung’s robotic ambitions. Chung declined to speculate on Ballie’s impact on Samsung’s robotics plans if it were to fail, instead noting that the company is committed to making it “a success.” But even if Ballie doesn’t thrill its users out of the gate, he hopes it will help prove that robotic assistants can be indispensable in our homes. Though that might sound strange, Chung points out that some of the appliances and gadgets we rely on now weren’t part of our lives 10 years ago. “The question is: What will become prevalent? What will we take for granted in the next 10 years?” he asked. “Home robots, I hope, will be one of them.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCAW4WYKJGTKS2BM2RGSSDHM7Y.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCAW4WYKJGTKS2BM2RGSSDHM7Y.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCAW4WYKJGTKS2BM2RGSSDHM7Y.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCAW4WYKJGTKS2BM2RGSSDHM7Y.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCAW4WYKJGTKS2BM2RGSSDHM7Y.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OCAW4WYKJGTKS2BM2RGSSDHM7Y.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/08/samsung-ballie-home-robot-projector/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 18:28:00,

NEW YORK — A lawyer for the National Rifle Association said in court Tuesday that the nonprofit gun rights group is far from the type of “scam” charity alleged in a civil corruption lawsuit by the New York attorney general. NRA lawyer Sarah Rogers said in her opening statement that the group was not one known for stealing funds from donors. New York state’s lawsuit against the NRA alleges that longtime leader Wayne LaPierre and his inner circle abused access to millions of dollars belonging to the organization. “Everyone in this courtroom should be able to agree that the NRA is not one of those scam charities,” Rogers said. “Whether you agree or disagree with the NRA’s mission, there should be no dispute the NRA delivers on that mission.” Rogers said the NRA is effective in what it does for gun rights advocacy, which is “why everyone in this room knows the NRA by name.” New York Attorney General Letitia James (D)  , LaPierre and three others in 2020 for allegedly engaging in corrupt practices that violated state law governing how charities registered in New York can operate. The NRA was founded in 1871 in New York. LaPierre is accused of accepting lavish gifts that amounted to conflicts of interest. He allegedly ran up   for private jets to the Bahamas and elsewhere, other travel expenses, expensive outings and pricey clothing for personal benefit. His attorney Kent Correll said in his opening statement Tuesday that there were valid business reasons for LaPierre’s spending. LaPierre spent more than $500,000 on charter flights to the Bahamas eight times in three years to attend annual gatherings hosted by his wealthy friend, film producer David McKenzie, Correll said. There were influential people there and networking with them was beneficial to the NRA, he said. LaPierre receives “a lot of death threats” and was instructed to fly only on private aircraft, Correll said. LaPierre’s costly clothes also had true business purposes, the attorney said. James’s offices has argued that NRA supporters have been duped and cheated by rampant financial abuses at the organization. LaPierre and his associates allegedly cost them millions of dollars. Special counsel Monica Connell argued Monday that LaPierre called the shots at the NRA and shut down anyone he saw as a threat to his ability to spend NRA funds. The state attorney said the organization under LaPierre “did not operate according to law or even according to its own rules” but rather on the basis of what LaPierre wanted. If they lose at trial, LaPierre and current general counsel John Frazer, along with former treasurer Wilson Phillips, could be made to refund the NRA millions. Former chief of staff Joshua Powell was also a defendant, but he settled his case Friday for $100,000 and an agreement to testify. On Friday, LaPierre   after more than three decades as NRA chief executive, citing health issues, effective at the end of January. James is still also asking for a formal ruling that he should be removed from his position, along with Frazer, the only other remaining employee among the defendants in the case. After opening statements finished Tuesday, state lawyers called the first witness to testify. Roscoe Marshall, a Texas businessman and former NRA board member, told the court that he grew concerned about the organization after James filed her lawsuit. He testified that he began asking questions and raising concerns internally, and was met with hostility from fellow board members and resistance from Frazer when he requested certain records. He filed an internal NRA ethics complaint against Frazer. Marshall said the allegations he first learned about when news of the lawsuit broke shed light on grave operational and financial issues at the NRA that had been kept quiet. “My hope really from the beginning until now was to help [the NRA] and put it on the right path,” Marshall testified. “They’ve been on the wrong path for a very long time in my opinion.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4JY3IGRYD6US5GCZHFYL265NA.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4JY3IGRYD6US5GCZHFYL265NA.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4JY3IGRYD6US5GCZHFYL265NA.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4JY3IGRYD6US5GCZHFYL265NA.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4JY3IGRYD6US5GCZHFYL265NA.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E4JY3IGRYD6US5GCZHFYL265NA.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/09/nra-wayne-lapierre-new-york-corruption-trial/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 17:22:00,
"Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed an executive order calling for the state to develop guardrails to protect residents from the risk of bias and discrimination as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly useful and common, though the order did not specify how the government intends to use AI in the future. The order acknowledged the potential for AI to be a “tremendous force for good” if developed and deployed responsibly. But the order also called out the risk that the technology could perpetuate harmful biases, invade citizens’ privacy, and expose sensitive data when used inappropriately or carelessly. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) signed an executive order calling for the state to develop guardrails to protect residents from the risk of bias and discrimination as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly useful and common, though the order did not specify how the government intends to use AI in the future. The order acknowledged the potential for AI to be a “tremendous force for good” if developed and deployed responsibly. But the order also called out the risk that the technology could perpetuate harmful biases, invade citizens’ privacy, and expose sensitive data when used inappropriately or carelessly. “It is not lost on me that, for many people in our state, the words ‘AI’ and ‘cyber’ can make some people scared,” Moore said at a news conference. “Here’s the thing: This technology is already here. The only question is whether we are going to be reactive or proactive in this moment.” Maryland joins a   expected to enact new rules for AI in 2024, even as federal lawmakers have said they are   in regulating the industry. According to a   in December by the Center on Technology Policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, at least 15 states passed new laws related to AI tools in 2023, mostly aimed at getting lawmakers up to speed on the concerns emerging as the technology expands. Already, states such as  ,   and   have passed laws barring the use of generative AI and “deep fakes” in political ads. Several others have directed state officials to study the issue and consider further changes this year. Moore’s executive order establishes an AI subcabinet to ensure that state agencies follow a set of principles guiding the ethical and productive use of AI technologies. The subcabinet will also be tasked with identifying opportunities AI could offer to recruit or expand businesses, providing a needed jolt to the state’s  . Maryland officials on Monday additionally announced plans to modernize the state’s digital infrastructure, expand access to online resources and combat cybersecurity threats. State lawmakers, set to convene Wednesday for a 90-day marathon of policymaking, also plan to focus on generative AI and what role government should have in regulating it. Legislators say they are worried about everything from job loss to children’s online safety and plan to debate what to do about the technology, even if they don’t have any answers yet. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said in an interview that he believes the General Assembly will fortify pieces of Moore’s executive order by enacting them into state law and will then go further. “We’re going to look toward protections for consumers so that Maryland is a place where residents feel comfortable using those new technologies because there’s the right protections in place,” he said. Del. Joseline A. Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s), one of the lawmakers Moore thanked for their support on AI-related issues, told The Washington Post in an interview that the state needs to implement guardrails as it embraces new uses for the technology. “It’s good, but it also has biases and can be abused,” she said. “We have to address it.” Other lawmakers want to spend their 90 days together fact-finding to glean the best policies on AI to introduce later. “I think it’s very dangerous to regulate something you don’t really understand. I think a lot of people under- and overestimate what AI is, what it is capable of,” said House Economic Matters Committee Chair C.T. Wilson (D-Charles). Although one common fear of AI involves a   in which computers lash out against humanity, many experts, ethicists and government officials are more concerned with the risk of  , discrimination and   that can be built into AI tools — even unintentionally. Moore’s order spelled out several guiding principles to keep AI from running amok in Maryland. Those principles include fairness and equity; innovation; privacy; safety, security and resiliency; validity and reliability; and transparency, accountability and explainability. The subcabinet will include the secretaries of information technology, budget and management, general services, labor, and commerce, as well as several other state officials who will provide guidance on the use of data, privacy and cybersecurity. In addition to the executive order,  Katie Savage announced plans to modernize the state government’s digital systems and expand critical infrastructure to prepare for AI and other new technologies. The newly formed Maryland Digital Service will help coordinate new technology-related initiatives across all state agencies, Savage said, bringing the talent needed to develop a modern digital infrastructure using existing funds. Among the group’s projects will be ensuring that Marylanders with disabilities can access state websites and online resources. Those efforts will include ensuring all of the state’s websites adhere to nonvisual compliance, so that residents with visual impairments can use the sites. The team will also work to increase translated resources for residents who do not speak English, Savage said The secretary also announced the creation of a Maryland Cybersecurity Task Force, which will be a partnership among the state’s information technology, emergency management and military departments. That task force is charged with responding to security incidents, developing systemwide approaches to preventing attacks and providing support for local governments as they modernize their security systems. “The goal is to foster a whole-of-government approach to further enhance the state’s cybersecurity capabilities and better support local governments in need of cybersecurity maturity,” Savage said. Some past cybersecurity breaches have profoundly interrupted government work. A December 2021 malware attack on the Maryland Department of Health   in the midst of a particularly brutal   surge. Moore said the changes announced Monday will bring Maryland up to date with modern advances after years of neglecting to improve the state’s digital infrastructure. “My iPhone asks me to update it like every eight weeks, but we have not updated the way the government works in the past eight years,” Moore said. “We cannot afford to be stuck with a system that is 10 years out of date.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XII3OSTBALX7WEMUCRAK4UZKUY_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XII3OSTBALX7WEMUCRAK4UZKUY_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XII3OSTBALX7WEMUCRAK4UZKUY_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XII3OSTBALX7WEMUCRAK4UZKUY_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XII3OSTBALX7WEMUCRAK4UZKUY_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XII3OSTBALX7WEMUCRAK4UZKUY_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/08/maryland-ai-government-wes-moore/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 17:26:00,

The iPhone was lying on the ground, in airplane mode, with its battery half full. The screen, fully intact, showed a $70 receipt for two checked bags on Alaska Airlines flight 1282. A social media user by the name Sean Bates found the device while walking down Barnes Road near Highway 217 in Portland, Ore., he , formerly Twitter, on Sunday. “Survived a 16,000 foot drop,” he tweeted. When he called the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency investigating the incident, to report the phone, he learned “it was the SECOND phone to be found,” he wrote. When a   minutes after takeoff on Friday evening, it left a gaping, door-shaped hole in the Boeing 737 Max 9 plane. A handful of objects were sucked out of the plane that was 16,000 feet in the sky. The iPhone found by Bates was most likely one of them, the NTSB told media outlets. The aircraft made an emergency landing, and while there was extensive damage to the inside of the plane, everyone on board survived. It is unclear if the other phone, found in a yard according to the NTSB, was an iPhone. The NTSB did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post. A broken-off plug was still inside the charging socket, according to a photo Bates posted, implying the phone was being charged when it was sucked out by what is   as an explosive depressurization accident. Found an iPhone on the side of the road... Still in airplane mode with half a battery and open to a baggage claim for   ASA1282 Survived a 16,000 foot drop perfectly in tact! When I called it in, Zoe at   said it was the SECOND phone to be found. No door yet😅  The iPhone is known for many things — surviving a 16,000-foot fall from an airplane is not one of them. Nearly anyone who’s owned a smartphone has had the experience of dropping one and cracking the screen. And though smartphone screens have become a lot stronger over the years, this phone’s survival is most likely because of physics. “The basic answer is air resistance,” said Duncan Watts, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo. “I think the counterintuitive thing here is that an iPhone falling from the sky doesn’t end up moving that quickly because of air resistance.” Any object falling through toward Earth will reach a point, known as its terminal velocity, where the force of gravity can’t accelerate it anymore because of resistance from the air in the atmosphere. “If the phone is falling with its screen facing the ground, there’s quite a lot of drag, but if the phone is falling straight up and down, there’s quite a bit less,” Watts said. “In reality, the phone would be tumbling quite a bit, and get quite a lot of wind essentially giving an upward force.” The terminal velocity of a large screen-down iPhone, according to Watts, would be about 30 mph. “The larger the iPhone, the lower the terminal velocity,” he said. “The maximum is around 100 mph, but that would only happen if the phone’s screen was perpendicular to the ground.” Watts said that when we drop a phone from waist-height, it hits the ground at around 10 mph, while a phone dropped from the top of an airplane probably only reaches 50 mph. Watts pointed out that the phone surely would have been damaged had it landed on stone or pavement, but the grass or foliage it seems to have fallen on cushioned its fall. “If the iPhone fell on a grassy patch, then it definitely could have survived the fall,” Watts said. “If the phone was facing straight down, it would have gone from about 30 mph to stationary on a relatively cushy surface, a little less force than if I decided to stomp on it.” According to Apple, the company that created the iPhone, the device can be damaged if it is dropped. Apple’s user guide does not specify how high a fall the iPhone is meant to survive. “Handle iPhone with care. It is made of metal, glass, and plastic and has sensitive electronic components inside”   the guide. “iPhone or its battery can be damaged if dropped, burned, punctured, or crushed, or if it comes in contact with liquid.” In a TikTok   uploaded Sunday by Bates, who did not respond to a request for comment Monday, he said he found the phone under a bush while on a walk to look for things that might have fallen from the plane.  He was “a little skeptical at first” that it belonged to an Alaska Airlines passenger. After opening it, he found travel confirmation for the Alaska Airlines flight and that’s when he called the NTSB, he said. “It was still pretty clean,” he said. “No scratches on it.” This is seemingly not the first time an iPhone has survived falling out of the sky. In June 2023, a TikTok user named Hatton Smith   in which he said his iPhone survived after it flew out of his pocket while skydiving at 14,000 feet. The phone landed in a grassy, muddy area, as can be seen in the video inlet within his TikTok. In both cases, if the iPhone had landed on concrete, it would likely not have survived. “If it fell on some damp ground, I could see it having about an inch of cushion,” Watts said. “That’s maybe what plopping down on a chair would feel like.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SUEWTMX4IVS5JIJJTBYBEWP3HE_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SUEWTMX4IVS5JIJJTBYBEWP3HE_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SUEWTMX4IVS5JIJJTBYBEWP3HE_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SUEWTMX4IVS5JIJJTBYBEWP3HE_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SUEWTMX4IVS5JIJJTBYBEWP3HE_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SUEWTMX4IVS5JIJJTBYBEWP3HE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/08/iphone-survives-16000-foot-fall-alaska-airlines/,Washington Post,2024-01-08 20:02:00,

Amazon’s customer ratings and reviews are   fraud, manipulation and nonsense. I have been worried that AI-written review snapshots could worsen the  I remain concerned that AI will make online shopping more chaotic and untrustworthy. But my impression has shifted from ABSOLUTELY NO to hmm … maybe this is a decent use of text-summarizing AI — as long as you learn to read Amazon’s AI digests with a savvy eye. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. I’m writing about these AI summaries because Amazon’s customer reviews have already influenced the entire system of online feedback for hotels, restaurants, movies and doctors. Like it or not, Amazon’s experiment with AI is a harbinger of a future in which we’ll need skills to sift through AI-written text and AI-generated images. I picked at random an Amazon product listing for  . Scroll way down the page to the section for customer reviews. One of the first things you’ll see is a few sentences of what “Customers say” about the product. Amazon says that is a distillation by AI from the text of nearly 40,000 customer reviews. (It appears that you must be logged in to your Amazon account to see AI summaries. Not all products have AI-generated summaries of customer feedback.) Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of the e-commerce research firm  , pointed out that since Amazon started the AI-generated review summaries last year, the company has tweaked them to highlight terms or features that apparently come up a lot in customer ratings. The positive features are highlighted in green and the negative or neutral feedback is in yellow and gray. You can see that in the Stanley mug AI summary, with “Scratching” and “Value” in those undesirable colors. If you like to get a gist of what shoppers thought of a product, Amazon’s AI summary can spare you from skimming the reviews yourself. When my colleague   was hunting recently for pet hair clippers, one AI blurb mentioned fur getting caught in a product’s guard and the blades not being sharp. That was enough for her to rule it out as a possible purchase. But as with Amazon reviews in general, the AI summaries might be incomplete or untrustworthy. I looked up a (human) hair removal product that some of the reviewers complained had irritated their skin or didn’t work as promised. Those complaints weren’t mentioned in the AI summary of the product reviews. The AI summary also describes the product as a “foot scraper.” It’s not. Bloomberg News recently   dozens of AI review summaries and found in some cases they underplayed customers’ negative feedback and exaggerated them for other products. And, of course, if the reviews themselves are misinformed or rigged, a summary of junk customer feedback will also be junk. Amazon said the company is “seeing positive feedback on our review highlights from both customers and sellers” but that it will “continually improve the review highlights experience over time.”  ,   and   are also experimenting with using AI to spit out descriptions of products from a photo or a few keywords. Some of this AI-generated text will be better than the confusing product listings you sometimes read online. A lot of it will be worse. A bunch of technology companies, including   and  , are also betting that AI will be   than current methods for creating product advertisements to   and social media feeds. Hooray, right?! Kaziukenas is worried, too, about the potential for misuse of AI in online reviews. You could imagine companies trying to pay off or nudge reviewers to repeatedly mention keywords in the hopes that AI will include them in a review summary. “If this grows, that will become yet another part of the Amazon game — getting the right kind of reviews mentioning the right kind of things to make the algorithm summarize it best,” Kaziukenas said. This has already happened with Google’s web search AI. Websites stuff   so you might find them when you search for “easy chicken dinners” or “Mother’s Day gifts.” (The Washington Post does this, too.) Needing to use magic words for web search robots is why recipe websites . It results in gibberish product listings like this one: “Reusable Stainless Steel Water Bottle Travel Mug Cupholder Friendly Insulated Cup Holiday Gifts for Women Men Him Her (Lavender).” In other words, the web is already written for AI in ways that make it unreadable for humans. I worry that even more AI in shopping and beyond will make the problem much worse.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7DAX4V76NGXZPTCTTQZU5PQBM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7DAX4V76NGXZPTCTTQZU5PQBM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7DAX4V76NGXZPTCTTQZU5PQBM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7DAX4V76NGXZPTCTTQZU5PQBM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7DAX4V76NGXZPTCTTQZU5PQBM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7DAX4V76NGXZPTCTTQZU5PQBM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/09/amazon-ai-customer-reviews-trust/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 12:33:00,

He predicted that if a president was involved in murder, he would be “speedily” impeached. The panel could issue a ruling at any time, potentially delaying the March trial that Trump is seeking to  until after the presidential election, in which he is the leading Republican candidate. The hearing — which included references dating back to George Washington’s tenure — showed how the historic prosecution of Trump has raised difficult questions, largely avoided for more than two centuries, about the limits of presidential power and the consequences of presidential crimes. No president has been charged with a crime before, and both Trump and his attorneys warned that the case would open “a Pandora’s box” for future presidents to be charged with all manner of crimes or to serve in fear of facing such charges when they left the White House. Trump has  , if reelected, to hire a special prosecutor to “go after”   and his family. “It’ll be bedlam in the country,” Trump  , speaking at a hotel he   near the courthouse. He left without taking questions from reporters. In court, Pearce responded that Trump’s singular actions had brought the country to this point. “Never before has there been allegations that a sitting president has, with private individuals and using the levers of power, sought to fundamentally subvert the democratic republic and the electoral system,” he said. Trump’s case does not augur “a sea change of vindictive tit-for-tat prosecutions in the future. I think it reflects the fundamentally unprecedented nature of the criminal charges here.” Trump was not required to attend the hearing but chose to do so. As Pearce made that point, Trump quietly shook his head in disagreement. Otherwise he appeared to listen impassively from the crowded courtroom gallery as the judges challenged his attorney’s contentions. Trump’s argument is that the judges should use the same reasoning that  to give Richard M. Nixon immunity from civil lawsuits for official acts in 1982. In that case, the justices  fear of lawsuits “could distract a President from his public duties” and was an “intrusion on the authority and functions” of the executive. But as Judge J. Michelle Childs pointed out, Nixon was pardoned by his successor, indicating “an assumption that [he] could be prosecuted” criminally after leaving office. Sauer said that situation was different because Nixon’s alleged crimes involved “purely private conduct” — an assertion Pearce rebutted forcefully, noting that the Republican  using the CIA to interfere in an FBI investigation. But Sauer later suggested that anything a president does while in office is likely to be an official duty, saying the fact that the indictment against Trump “focuses solely on acts before he left office” is “a telling indication that were dealing with official acts.” Judge Karen L. Henderson, the lone Republican appointee on the panel and a jurist  of presidential power, expressed some concern about Sauer’s warning of “the floodgates” of prosecutions that could open. But she said it was “paradoxical to say that [Trump’s] constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate criminal laws.” She also said case law over the past two centuries indicates that “whether a man in the street, or a president … you can be held criminally liable” for various acts. Both Henderson and Pan noted that Trump was now making the exact opposite argument of the one he made at his impeachment trial, when his lawyers told senators that the criminal justice system was the appropriate venue for accountability. Pan quoted  , “We have an investigative process in this country to which no former officeholder is immune.” Pan, who seemed most dubious of Trump’s arguments, said the former president’s double-barreled claims of immunity — that he was immune for official actions he took as president, and that he could not be charged criminally because his impeachment trial ended in an acquittal — actually worked against each other. For the former president to argue that he can be prosecuted only after a conviction by the Senate, she said, he is quietly conceding that he can be charged and does not have the immunity he claims. Sauer disputed the judge’s characterization, saying the impeachment process is an important check on prosecutions that satisfies constitutional concerns. A different panel of the D.C. Circuit   that in the context of a lawsuit brought by police officers and lawmakers injured on Jan. 6, Trump does not have absolute immunity because campaigning to stay in office is not an official act. Trump has said he plans to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court as well, and Sauer maintained that Trump’s meetings with members of Congress and the Justice Department about overturning the election, along with his tweets falsely claiming election fraud, all count as protected official conduct. The government asked the court to follow the  , who is overseeing Trump’s trial and concluded that there is no criminal immunity for former presidents for either public or private conduct. If the judges say there is immunity for presidential duties, Pearce said, “there are some hard questions about the nature of official acts,” which would lead to “extraordinarily complicated litigation” over what qualifies. When the court rules might be as important as how it rules. Sauer asked at the hearing for any ruling against Trump to be put on hold for appeals to the full D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Special counsel Jack Smith had  the Supreme Court to take up the immunity question without waiting for the D.C. Circuit to rule first; that request was  . The Justice Department   in the past that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted. “He’s going to lose; the only question is how long will the delay be,” said Saikrishna Prakash, a professor at the University of Virginia’s law school who studies presidential authority. “There are people who might think some sort of immunity might be necessary, but the facts aren’t helpful to the former president.” Smith’s office asked the court to issue a final order within five days of its opinion, potentially putting Trump’s trial back on a fast track. If judges do so after ruling against Trump, the Supreme Court could, if it wishes, take up his legal challenge while letting the trial go forward. The judges also pressed both sides on a  arguing that Trump does not have the right to appeal before trial because he is making a novel claim. That position is based on a line in a   that was not about immunity, in which then-Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that a person must wait until after a trial to appeal unless there is “an explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee that trial will not occur.” Both the Justice Department and Trump disagreed; Pearce called it “a small point of common ground” that a former president had a right not to be tried until courts had determined whether he is immune from prosecution. Even if it would help the government to have the appeal thrown out on jurisdictional grounds, Pearce said, “doing justice means getting the law right.” A ruling by the D.C. Circuit will affect only one of the  . But Trump is making similar arguments in  , where he is charged in an alleged conspiracy that covers much of the same conduct. The other two cases do not involve Trump’s conduct as president. In New York, state prosecutors accuse him of falsifying business records before he took office. In Florida, Smith’s office has charged him with mishandling classified documents after leaving office. Walt Nauta, Trump’s longtime personal aide and   in the Florida case, sat with the former president in court Tuesday.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OZNCMEQSJBK2J6QDA7HY72GT6I_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OZNCMEQSJBK2J6QDA7HY72GT6I_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OZNCMEQSJBK2J6QDA7HY72GT6I_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OZNCMEQSJBK2J6QDA7HY72GT6I_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OZNCMEQSJBK2J6QDA7HY72GT6I_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OZNCMEQSJBK2J6QDA7HY72GT6I_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/09/trump-immunity-appeals-court-arguments/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 17:59:00,

Hoyer, 84,   Tuesday in a deeply Democratic area he has represented in Congress since 1981, and before that the Maryland legislature starting in 1967. “I believe I have more work to complete on behalf of my district, my state, and my country,” he said in a statement to The Washington Post. “I am blessed to have the good health, strength, and enduring passion necessary to continue serving my constituents at this decisive moment for Maryland and America.” Hoyer stepped out of leadership last January, along with then-Speaker Rep.

Hoyer, who is on the Appropriations Committee, cited securing funding for the FBI headquarters as unfinished business he wants to conclude, along with paying for Judy Centers in Maryland — the preschools named after his late first wife, Judith P.

I believe in the next Congress we will have a Democratic Majority that will be able to deliver for families in Maryland and across the country,” he said. “During this coming election, the values, character, and very soul of America are at risk. Freedom, which makes our nation exceptional, will be on the ballot.” Several key Maryland politicians encouraged Hoyer to seek another term, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Gov. Wes Moore (D), who planned to gather alongside Hoyer for a Maryland Democratic Party reception in Annapolis on Tuesday. “Steny H. Hoyer has a proven record of delivering for our state,” Van Hollen said in a statement that called Hoyer “a leader on Team Maryland” who will be a “critical” member in fighting for Maryland’s priorities. “He truly cares and puts his whole heart into everything he does,” Van Hollen said. Moore said he was “thrilled” Hoyer will seek another term, saying the congressman’s impact on the state “is truly immeasurable.” “Few people have made as big of a difference in the lives of Marylanders as Congressman Hoyer,” Moore said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZO4RLPOL7WB3BS6FII4AEVNWY.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZO4RLPOL7WB3BS6FII4AEVNWY.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZO4RLPOL7WB3BS6FII4AEVNWY.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZO4RLPOL7WB3BS6FII4AEVNWY.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZO4RLPOL7WB3BS6FII4AEVNWY.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6ZO4RLPOL7WB3BS6FII4AEVNWY.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/08/steny-hoyer-reelection-maryland/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 17:04:00,
"Charles O. Jones, a dean of American political scientists who was known for the expertise and insight he brought to the study of Congress and the presidency, died Jan. 3 at a hospice center in Fishersville, Va. He was 92. The cause was complications from a stroke, said his son Daniel Jones. Charles O. Jones, a dean of American political scientists who was known for the expertise and insight he brought to the study of Congress and the presidency, died Jan. 3 at a hospice center in Fishersville, Va. He was 92. The cause was complications from a stroke, said his son Daniel Jones. Dr. Jones, an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, devoted decades to explaining the American democratic process — why citizens vote as they do, how politicians wield or fail to wield their power while in office, and how the branches of government interact. He was sought after far beyond academic circles, becoming a go-to source for political reporters and a familiar face to C-SPAN junkies. Norman J. Ornstein, an emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, described Dr. Jones as “one of the premier scholars of his generation.” Dr. Jones’s career coincided with the Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives that lasted four decades, from 1955 to 1995. As a Republican — but never a partisan — he was “more sensitive” to the role of the minority party, Ornstein said. His hallmark, Ornstein said, was “careful, reasoned and insightful theses built on his expertise and on data.” He cited Dr. Jones’s 1970 book “The Minority Party in Congress” as “seminal.” Dr. Jones was equally known as a scholar of the presidency, with books including “The Presidency in a Separated System” (1994), “Separate but Equal Branches: Congress and the Presidency” (1995) and “Passages to the Presidency: From Campaigning to Governing” (1998). He also wrote book-length studies of the White House tenures of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Reporters on deadline often came to Dr. Jones for analysis of contemporary events as well as for historical context. He once observed that part of the legacy of the Watergate affair, which drove President Richard M. Nixon from office in 1974, was the erasure of the belief among many Americans that such a scandal was not possible in the White House. “Post-Watergate,”   a New York Times reporter in 2002, “we come to believe that it could be as bad as we think.” Charles Oscar Jones was born in Worthing, S.D., close to the Iowa border, on Oct. 28, 1931, one of six children. The family moved frequently as his father, a Congregationalist minister, struggled to find work. His mother was a homemaker. Dr. Jones recalled being physically abused by both his parents and by age 12 saved up enough money from his paper route to run away from home, which at the time was in rural Iowa. In a self-published memoir, Dr. Jones recounted that he stuffed his “few belongings in a pillowcase” and traveled by bus as far as Dallas, where he was arrested as a runaway. When his parents declined to send the funds necessary to bring him home, his paternal grandparents provided for him to make his way to Canton, S.D., where they lived, and where he spent the rest of his adolescence. The details of his odyssey escaped his memory, Dr. Jones wrote in his memoir. But what remained “crystal clear” in his mind was the “feeling of security” when he reached his grandparents. “I was safe and secure with family who loved me,” he remembered. Dr. Jones received a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of South Dakota in 1953. After Army service, he continued his studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he received a master’s degree in 1956 and a PhD in 1960. His early books included “The Republican Party in American Politics” (1965). Dr. Jones taught at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, the University of Arizona and the University of Pittsburgh before he joined the University of Virginia faculty in 1981. He returned to the University of Wisconsin in 1988, became chairman of the political science department, and took emeritus status in 1997. He was a scholar at the Brookings Institution and the presidential oral history program at the Miller Center, an affiliate of U-Va. centered on presidential scholarship and public policy. Survivors include his wife of 64 years, the former Vera Mire of Wintergreen, Va.; two sons, Joe B. Jones of Rapid City, S.D., and Daniel Jones of New York City and Accord, N.Y.; two brothers; a sister; and three grandchildren. Dr. Jones served as president of the American Political Science Association and editor of the American Political Science Review. In contrast with other seasoned academics who jealously guarded their own status, Ornstein said, Dr. Jones was known for “bringing in the younger scholars and making them feel wanted, worthy and at home.” As for the political reporters — as one of them recalled after his death — he “always had time for scribes.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ISE7TVTOJECGANVXR6OUEXDSM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ISE7TVTOJECGANVXR6OUEXDSM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ISE7TVTOJECGANVXR6OUEXDSM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ISE7TVTOJECGANVXR6OUEXDSM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ISE7TVTOJECGANVXR6OUEXDSM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ISE7TVTOJECGANVXR6OUEXDSM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/09/charles-o-jones-political-science-dead/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 18:05:00,

(D) on Tuesday announced three bills to tackle mounting concerns about crime, including one that would create a gun violence prevention center — the first state-level center in a Biden administration effort to reduce the number of fatal shootings across the United States. On the eve of a legislative session expected to have a strong focus on  , Moore on Tuesday rolled out plans that he said would help hold children accountable for violence while keeping rehabilitation in mind, and lamented the devastating toll gun violence has had on Maryland communities. “I believe in rehabilitation, but I will not tolerate lawlessness,” Moore said, “and we need accountability for the young person who picks up a handgun and threatens the safety of their neighbors.” Moore’s announcement — with the governor flanked by several Cabinet members, law enforcement officials and advocates against gun violence — was met with applause from community gun violence reduction organizations, which said it will lead to real solutions for the people most affected. “We have advocated for this for a very long time,” said Tarria Stanley, regional advocacy manager for the Community Justice Action Fund, a national organization that works to end gun violence in communities of color. “Just knowing that the governor is being progressive in gun violence prevention and being preventative, and not working on the reaction side.” The gun violence prevention center is planned as a part of the Maryland Department of Health and answers a call from the Biden administration, which established the federal government’s first office for gun violence prevention in September. Another proposal from Moore, the Victims’ Compensation Reform Act, would provide resources for crime victims in an effort to make people feel better supported and safer after reporting crimes. Moore’s third proposal, the Growing Apprenticeship in Public Safety (GAPS) Act, would establish stronger pipelines to law enforcement jobs, including for Marylanders without four-year college degrees. While overall youth violence in Maryland has been declining for more than a decade, mirroring a national trend,   and handgun violations by young people have skyrocketed since 2020 in the state, a 2023  . The uptick of violence and several  s have pushed the issue to the fore, demanding attention from Moore and lawmakers who say all proposals to curb crime should be on the table. Under pressure to act, some state lawmakers have called for a tougher approach and signaled a willingness to revisit recent reforms, including a law that prevents police from interrogating a minor without allowing the child to consult with an attorney. Others are proposing tweaks to existing laws, which could include mandating court intervention when a young child kills someone. Moore on Tuesday floated the possibility of increasing penalties for some gun crimes so that they can be charged as felonies instead of misdemeanors. He also said his administration is willing to use the state budget and executive orders to address the issue, alongside his proposed legislation. Department of Juvenile Services   said at Tuesday’s news conference that the agency is “digging out of a hole to build up services,” referencing past funding cuts to community programs to rehabilitate youths. In-custody programs were “sorely lacking,” he said. Schiraldi highlighted a new initiative, the Thrive Academy, which strategically targets youths who are most at risk to be victims of gun violence, or to commit it. “If simply locking kids up with adults was the solution, we’d already be feeling much safer than we are,” Schiraldi said. “Instead, we need to better engage young people while holding them accountable.” Moore was also joined by representatives from the Biden administration, who said the gun violence prevention center’s mission would be supported by federal grants that will educate 500 new school counselors in Maryland, and additional funding for community programs. “Simply put, these actions together will save lives,” said Rob Wilcox, deputy director of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Maryland lawmakers have differing views on how to address youth violence, but most agree that action needs to be taken. Sen. Jill P. Carter (D-Baltimore City), one of the most vocal supporters of the past reforms, said she believes the problem lies not with the law but with the practices of law enforcement officials. She said the legislature should make sure local police agencies know how to use tools such as “child in need of supervision” petitions that can connect at-risk children with services and court monitoring that may deter criminal behavior. Other lawmakers, including many Republicans, said the legislature should go further to prevent violent crime. House Minority Leader Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said the rise in violence, particularly among youths, created a “pendulum swing” in public sentiment about how to address crime, following years of reforms meant to tamp down on over-policing. “It’s time for us to get tougher on violent and repeat criminals. We’re constantly making it easier. We made it tougher to arrest them. We’ve made it tougher for them to have bail. We’ve made it easier for them to avoid serious sentences. We’ve made it easier for them to get out of jail earlier. Through a variety of methods, we minimize the consequences of their crimes. … People realize across the board, this doesn’t work.” Some, including Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Queen Anne’s), questioned how or whether the center would actively decrease the number of stolen and illegal guns in circulation. Hershey also called for consequences that would deter youths from committing violent crimes. “The governor talked about accountability, but he didn’t talk about consequences. What we are seeing right now is that   because they know there are no consequences,” he said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFGXSMU3SUV5CCOYZ6G6Q46PGY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFGXSMU3SUV5CCOYZ6G6Q46PGY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFGXSMU3SUV5CCOYZ6G6Q46PGY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFGXSMU3SUV5CCOYZ6G6Q46PGY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFGXSMU3SUV5CCOYZ6G6Q46PGY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JFGXSMU3SUV5CCOYZ6G6Q46PGY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/09/maryland-juvenile-justice-wes-moore/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 18:54:00,
"More than 850 people have been convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, but a prosecutor told a federal judge in D.C. on Tuesday that no case was quite like the twisting saga of the graying man who appeared before him by Zoom for sentencing:  More than 850 people have been convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, but a prosecutor told a federal judge in D.C. on Tuesday that no case was quite like the twisting saga of the graying man who appeared before him by Zoom for sentencing:  Epps had been on the front lines of the mob as it pushed toward the Capitol, but the prosecutor said that he was the only defendant known to have tried to de-escalate the violence at points and that he turned himself in to the FBI on Jan. 8, 2021. He cooperated with authorities and the House committee investigating the attack. Epps initially blamed antifa — a loose-knit group of far-left activists — for the  , but he himself became the subject of high-profile conspiracy theories by Tucker Carlson and others that he was an undercover government agent who had instigated the mayhem. Epps was forced to flee his home and now lives in a trailer in the woods in an undisclosed location. Federal prosecutors initially decided not to charge him, but he was ultimately indicted and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of disruptive conduct — an attempt to hold him accountable but also recognize his mitigating conduct and the backlash against him. As U.S. Attorney Michael M. Gordon put it in court: “This is unquestionably a unique and complicated case.” James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court in D.C., referenced that unusual nature in ultimately sentencing Epps on Tuesday to probation, bringing the 62-year-old’s strange Jan. 6 legal odyssey to a close. He is from Arizona and has worked as a roofer. Epps, who wore a pinstriped suit and tie, told Boasberg shortly before his sentence was handed down that he now knows the election was not stolen and that it was   supporters like him who had carried out the attack. He expressed remorse for his actions and said the experience of being accused of   by the “Trump cult and Fox News” had been searing. Epps is suing Fox News and  Carlson for defamation,   by saying that on-air hosts were expressing opinions, which are protected by the First Amendment. Epps received death threats and found shell casings in his yard, and people inspired by the false allegations that he was a government agent booked the wedding venue he and his wife ran  in Arizona so they could harangue him, his attorney said. The couple sold the venue and went into hiding. “It was a life-changing reality,” Epps told the judge. Epps spoke as a   was playing out nearby in D.C. Gordon traced Epps’s involvement in Jan. 6 to the evening before the riot, when Epps was captured on a video shared on social media that showed him in a crowd at  . After some members of the crowd say they want to fight antifa and Black Lives Matter supporters, Epps urges restraint and tells them that he is going to go peacefully inside the Capitol on Jan. 6 and that he will probably be arrested. “He viewed this as a 1776 moment,” Gordon told the judge. Members of the crowd accuse Epps of being an agent provocateur, which later helped spur the conspiracy theories about him. Members of the crowd chant “Fed! Fed!” at him at one point. Gordon also showed video in court of Epps urging Trump supporters to march to the Capitol during Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally the next day. Later, at the Capitol, video shows Epps near the vanguard of the mob as it pushes through one fence set up by police and then a second. Epps ultimately made it near the steps of the Capitol, where video showed him  near a group of rioters pushing a massive Trump sign toward a line of police officers. Gordon said video of the action is not definitive about whether Epps helped push the sign, but he was among a group that moved toward the police line. Epps’s attorney said he was trapped in the crowd. Gordon said that Epps never entered the Capitol and that he also made at least five attempts during the afternoon to tamp down the violence of the Jan. 6 crowd. After the  , right-wing news outlets and Carlson falsely accused Epps of working for the government and helping spark Jan. 6 violence. In one video, Epps is seen whispering to a Jan. 6 rioter shortly before the man attacks a police line. Epps has maintained he was telling the man to remain calm. Gordon said in court that the only connection Epps had to the government was the four years he spent in the Marines. Federal prosecutors had wanted Epps to serve a six-month sentence, while Edward Ungvarsky, Epps’s attorney, argued for probation. The judge ultimately decided against a jail sentence, saying Epps appeared contrite and had done admirable work in the community. “You were hounded out of your home and hounded out of your town,” Boasberg told Epps. “You had to live like a fugitive because of the lies of others.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IH5LABVRJJT42XF3DDJTEKMIQY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IH5LABVRJJT42XF3DDJTEKMIQY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IH5LABVRJJT42XF3DDJTEKMIQY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IH5LABVRJJT42XF3DDJTEKMIQY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IH5LABVRJJT42XF3DDJTEKMIQY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IH5LABVRJJT42XF3DDJTEKMIQY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/09/ray-epps-sentenced-probation-jan-6/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 18:46:00,
"Millions of households will lose discounts on their internet bills in the coming months if Congress does not act to extend an affordable-internet program. The Federal Communications Commission says it will begin winding down  this week if it cannot secure more funding from Congress. Launched at the end of 2021, the ACP allowed some 23 million low-income households to receive discounts on their internet bills of up to $30 a month — or up to $75 a month on qualifying tribal lands. Millions of households will lose discounts on their internet bills in the coming months if Congress does not act to extend an affordable-internet program. The Federal Communications Commission says it will begin winding down  this week if it cannot secure more funding from Congress. Launched at the end of 2021, the ACP allowed some 23 million low-income households to receive discounts on their internet bills of up to $30 a month — or up to $75 a month on qualifying tribal lands. The FCC said the $14.2 billion that Congress appropriated for the program will run out in April. The program — which the FCC calls the country’s largest internet affordability program ever — will be shut down unless funding is renewed. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel   dated Monday to congressional leaders seeking $6 billion to continue the program through the end of 2024. “Absent additional funding, we could lose the significant progress this program has made toward closing the digital divide,” Rosenworcel wrote. “Yet we have come too far with the ACP to turn back.” Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), chair of the Senate Commerce Committee and a recipient of one of the letters, said in a statement that 330,000 people in Washington state rely on the ACP for their internet access and that she would “support any Presidential request to provide additional funding for this program.” The ACP originated as a short-term pandemic measure to ease economic pain by providing low-income households with up to $50 in monthly discounts on their internet bills. As workplaces switched to Zoom meetings, and as schools began remote classes, having reliable internet access became increasingly crucial and the program aimed to help close the digital divide. The Biden administration has made universal access to high-speed internet by 2030 one of its policy priorities, with a range of measures aimed at ensuring that households in remote areas can have affordable service and that users are not discriminated against by income level, race or other factors. Biden has likened it to the government’s effort in the 1930s to bring electricity to the entire nation, calling internet access a necessity for modern work and life. The program, dubbed the Emergency Broadband Benefit, was popular with users but not without controversy: A   found that internet service providers unleashed price increases, service cuts and sometimes fraud as they scrambled for EBB subsidies. When the EBB ended in 2021, it was replaced by the ACP, which offered similar but smaller discounts to eligible households. The FCC said rural households had a higher enrollment rate under the ACP, though both urban and rural users are eligible. A household is eligible for the ACP if it’s at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines — about $60,000 for a family of four — or if it meets other criteria, such as a member participating in certain government assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, federal housing assistance or the National School Lunch Program. Separate from the ACP, the Biden administration in June announced   to expand high-speed internet access nationwide. About 7 percent of the country still does not have broadband internet service that meets the government’s minimum standards, according to federal estimates.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVH5KWKAO6DDLAF57YLI7JL4AQ_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVH5KWKAO6DDLAF57YLI7JL4AQ_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVH5KWKAO6DDLAF57YLI7JL4AQ_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVH5KWKAO6DDLAF57YLI7JL4AQ_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVH5KWKAO6DDLAF57YLI7JL4AQ_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KVH5KWKAO6DDLAF57YLI7JL4AQ_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/09/affordable-connectivity-program-congress/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 12:50:00,
"The first U.S. space mission in more than 50 years intended to land softly on the moon won’t reach the lunar surface, the company that designed it said Tuesday. The failure of Astrobotic Technology’s Peregrine lander is a setback for NASA’s effort to send a fleet of commercially developed robotic spacecraft to Earth’s closest celestial neighbor in the months and years to come. The first U.S. space mission in more than 50 years intended to land softly on the moon won’t reach the lunar surface, the company that designed it said Tuesday. The failure of Astrobotic Technology’s Peregrine lander is a setback for NASA’s effort to send a fleet of commercially developed robotic spacecraft to Earth’s closest celestial neighbor in the months and years to come. The six-foot-tall spacecraft, designed and operated by Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic, lifted off successfully from Cape Canaveral at 2:18 a.m. Monday atop a rocket provided by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and was able to communicate with controllers on the ground. But seven hours after launch, the company said the spacecraft had suffered a failure in its propulsion system and was leaking fuel. The company initially said it reoriented the craft so that its solar panels could recharge its battery and expressed optimism that at least parts of the mission could be salvaged. But by late Monday, Astrobiotic said that the wounded spacecraft, still leaking propellant, was fighting against an “uncontrollable tumble” as it limped toward the moon. The company Monday hoped at least “to get Peregrine as close to lunar distance as we can before it loses the ability to maintain its sun-pointing distance and subsequently loses power.” But on Tuesday, it said definitively that reaching the surface would not happen: “Given the propellant leak, there is, unfortunately, no chance of a soft landing on the moon.” The vehicle is carrying a suite of science experiments but no people. The company said that with the propulsion system problem, the spacecraft’s attitude control system thrusters were fighting “well beyond their expected service life cycles to keep the lander from an uncontrollable tumble.” If they could continue to fire they could keep the spacecraft stable for an additional 40 hours “based on current fuel consumption” before losing power. Heading into the launch, leaders from Astrobotic and NASA said they were fully aware of the difficulties of attempting to land a spacecraft on the moon and that their attempt followed recent failures by several countries and private companies. “If you look back at the course of history, only about half those missions have been successful. And most of those have been funded by superpowers with vastly larger budgets than this mission has been granted. So it’s a really, really big challenge,” John Thornton, Astrobotic’s CEO, told reporters in a prelaunch briefing. But he said it won’t be the last attempt for NASA or Astrobotic, which intends to fly another mission to the moon later this year. “There's a train of next launches behind me,” he said. “We have our own launch coming up later this year. So in the event that we have a bad day somewhere along the mission, we're going to be gathering all of the data that we've received up to that point, and we're going to learn from it. And we're going to help industry learn from that. We're going to get smarter and we're going be ready for the next one.” When it first announced the program of sending a fleet of commercial, robotic spacecraft to the moon, NASA’s leaders said they knew some of them would fail and used a sports analogy to describe their approach: “We’re taking shots on goal.” NASA has another shot coming up in mid-February, when Intuitive Machines, a Houston-based company led by former NASA executives, is set to launch its spacecraft for a landing near the moon’s south pole. If all goes well, it would be expected to touch down on Feb. 22. Despite Astrobotic’s apparent failure, the twin missions represent an extraordinary moment in space exploration, as the growing commercial space sector seeks to extend its reach beyond low Earth orbit to the moon, some 240,000 miles away. It also is a significant moment for NASA, which commissioned the flights, with more to come, as part of an effort known as the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. NASA plans to spend $2.6 billion on the effort over 10 years. Astrobotic’s contract with NASA was worth $108 million.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCWJWC5LW4HHQY6QHSIQCUG6EA_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCWJWC5LW4HHQY6QHSIQCUG6EA_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCWJWC5LW4HHQY6QHSIQCUG6EA_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCWJWC5LW4HHQY6QHSIQCUG6EA_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCWJWC5LW4HHQY6QHSIQCUG6EA_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BCWJWC5LW4HHQY6QHSIQCUG6EA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/08/astrobotic-lunar-lander-failure/,Washington Post,2024-01-09 13:50:00,
