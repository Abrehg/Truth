"Michael Cohen, a former fixer and lawyer for former president  , said in a new court filing that he unknowingly gave his attorney bogus case citations after using artificial intelligence to create them as part of a legal bid to end his probation on tax evasion and campaign finance violation charges. Michael Cohen, a former fixer and lawyer for former president  , said in a new court filing that he unknowingly gave his attorney bogus case citations after using artificial intelligence to create them as part of a legal bid to end his probation on tax evasion and campaign finance violation charges. According to the , which was unsealed Friday, Cohen said he used Google Bard, an AI chatbot, to generate case citations that his lawyer could use to assist in making the case to shorten his supervised release. He pleaded guilty to the crimes in 2018 and had served time in prison. Cohen said he gave those citations to one of his attorneys, David M. Schwartz, who then used them in a motion filed with a U.S. federal judge on Cohen’s behalf, the filing said. Cohen’s admission comes after U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York said   that he could not find any of the three cases cited by Schwartz and asked for a “thorough explanation” of how these cases came to be included and “what role, if any” Cohen may have played in the motion before it was filed. In the filing, Cohen wrote that he had not kept up with “emerging trends (and related risks) in legal technology and did not realize that Google Bard was a generative text service that, like ChatGPT, could show citations and descriptions that looked real but actually were not.” To him, he said, Google Bard seemed to be a “supercharged search engine.” Cohen added that at no point did Schwartz or his paralegal “raise any concerns about the citations” he had suggested. “It did not occur to me then — and remains surprising to me now — that Mr. Schwartz would drop the cases into his submission wholesale without even confirming they had existed,” Cohen wrote. Schwartz did not immediately return a request for comment. The episode comes as Cohen is expected to play a prominent role in a Manhattan criminal case against Trump. It is also an indication of  , as a new generation of AI language tools make their way into the legal industry. According to Cohen’s filing, the mistake was caught by E. Danya Perry, a former federal prosecutor who is now representing Cohen in his effort to cut short his probation. Cohen said Schwartz made an “honest mistake,” and Perry has provided real case citations that make the case for why Cohen’s probation should be terminated. This is at least the second instance this year in which a Manhattan federal judge has confronted lawyers over using fake AI-generated citations. Two lawyers in June were fined $5,000 in an unrelated case where they used ChatGPT to create bogus case citations.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/29/michael-cohen-ai-google-bard-fake-citations/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 15:54:00,
"A year that many experts believed could end with a recession and rising unemployment instead concluded with a surging stock market and enthusiasm about the economy, as a combination of Big Tech and consumer sentiment sent financial markets barreling into 2024. The S&P 500, a market-tracking index that underpins the retirement fortunes of millions of Americans, gained nearly 25 percent in 2023, far more than analysts had expected at the beginning of the year. “Nobody was calling for 20 percent last January. … I mean nobody,” said Michael Farr of the D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller & Washington. A year that many experts believed could end with a recession and rising unemployment instead concluded with a surging stock market and enthusiasm about the economy, as a combination of Big Tech and consumer sentiment sent financial markets barreling into 2024. The S&P 500, a market-tracking index that underpins the retirement fortunes of millions of Americans, gained nearly 25 percent in 2023, far more than analysts had expected at the beginning of the year. “Nobody was calling for 20 percent last January. … I mean nobody,” said Michael Farr of the D.C.-based investment firm Farr, Miller & Washington. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed its earlier record and gained more than 13 percent. But it was the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, led by a group of elite tech firms dubbed “the Magnificent Seven,” that truly wowed Wall Street, gaining more than 40 percent for the year. Those same stocks had borne the brunt of a historic sell-off the year before, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, and they started the year on cautious footing as a recession seemed imminent. Instead, the economy remained stable, bolstering their investment prospects just in time for an explosion of investor attention around artificial intelligence. Most of the stock market gains came in the final months of the year, when a slew of new data seemed to confirm once and for all that the Fed’s goal of a “soft landing” ― shorthand for bringing inflation down without breaking the economy ― might be in sight. Since March 2022, the central bank has steadily dialed up its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in 22 years, now at 5.25 to 5.5 percent. Higher rates quash inflation because they force consumers and businesses to cut spending, the theory goes. Inflation did ultimately fall, but the rate-raising campaign also came with a cost. New mortgages became less affordable, shutting many out of homeownership. Businesses that relied on loans had to dial back expansion. A persistent fear among some investors was that the central bank would go too far with its rate hikes, slowing the economy too much in its zeal to bring prices down. Markets repeatedly sold off in 2022 as investors anticipated the Fed’s moves. Taking some of the worst losses was the tech sector, whose riskier, growth-oriented business model makes it more vulnerable to shocks, even minor changes in interest rates. The Nasdaq index lost a third of its value. At the start of 2023, analysts saw a 65 percent chance that the year would see a recession, according to a consensus estimate referenced by Goldman Sachs. Instead, the latest economic data suggests the higher rates are having the desired impact against inflation without the worst side effects. Inflation has   faster than expected, clocking in at 3.1 percent in November. That’s a far cry from its June 2022 peak of 9.1 percent and within sight of the Fed’s 2 percent goal. (The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation came in even lower, at 2.6 percent in November compared with the year before.) Meanwhile, the labor market has moderated without cratering. Overall job growth has slowed from an average of 240,000 new jobs each month to 199,000 in November, while the unemployment rate that month stood at  . In fact, the unemployment rate has stayed below 4 percent for two years, which was last achieved in the 1960s. As of Thursday, about 212,000 Americans were filing   each week, a widely followed proxy for layoffs that remains close to historic lows. Consumer spending has also held up. Fresh Mastercard data out Tuesday showed Americans spent their way through the holidays despite rising consumer debt and the lingering bite of inflation, with online spending up 6.3 percent. Even the global banking crisis, which rattled markets in March and April after a bank run forced Silicon Valley Bank to close its doors, failed to induce a broader collapse of the financial system. Wedbush senior analyst Dan Ives estimates that around 50 percent of the tech sector’s gains in 2023 stem from the Fed’s success in getting inflation under control — which in turn has raised expectations that the central bank will cut rates in 2024. The other half reflects investors’ search for opportunities related to AI, creating “a perfect storm for the tech bulls,” Ives added. The year began with mass layoffs. Amazon  around 27,000 jobs, citing an “uncertain economy.” Google’s parent company, Alphabet,  in mid-January that it would  , more than at any point in its history, with chief executive Sundar Pichai saying it had “hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.” Microsoft cut 10,000 jobs amid warnings from chief executive Satya Nadella that consumers were cutting spending and corporate customers were bracing for a recession. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and the newspaper’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on Amazon’s board.) Driving those cuts was a perception on Wall Street that the largest tech firms were bloated moneymaking giants with questionable growth prospects, akin to the railroad or steel conglomerates of decades past, said investor and stock trader Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research. In addition, the tech companies “aggressively built in 2021 and 2022, and the demand they thought they were building for didn’t come through,” Evercore ISI senior managing director Mark Mahaney said. As the year unfolded, however, demand for those companies’ services, like advertising and online retail, held up better than expected, Mahaney noted, while their balance sheets were strong after a season of cost cutting. A subsequent spate of healthy earnings brought investors back to the tech sector. Against that backdrop, the AI boom reaped fortunes for a few leading firms, leading to a literal renaming of the top-tier of tech players. These heavy hitters are now known as the Magnificent Seven: Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, and the latest newcomer, Nvidia. Nvidia has been one of the biggest AI winners after it was revealed in May that one of its computer chips had trained ChatGPT, the AI language model that has wowed users with its ability to solve problems and imitate human speech. The company’s share price spiked higher on that news and is now up almost 240 percent from the start of the year. But it’s not the only tech company that has ChatGPT and its creator, OpenAI, to thank for massive stock price gains. Microsoft, which invested $10 billion in OpenAI in January, has seen its stock rise more than 50 percent this year — increasing 13 percent alone in the month after its OpenAI investment was first reported. Some analysts believe the attention surrounding AI has already transformed investors’ broader view of the tech sector, even for companies that don’t have any AI-enabled products. “Artificial intelligence represents a new potential growth frontier for these companies,” Essaye said. “Regardless of whether your company is benefiting from AI, there is a favorable market reaction. This is it, and they’re piling into it.” How soon those investments will bear fruit is another question. ChatGPT wowed the world with its ability to imitate human speech and thought patterns, but the business case moving forward is less clear, Essaye noted. With tech, “the proof has to start showing up,” Essaye said. “And because [the Magnificent Seven] are such a big part of the S&P 500, if they begin to underperform, they will act as an anchor on the market regardless of what else happens.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/29/stock-market-2023/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 11:41:00,

"What’s worse than falling victim to a scam online? Being scammed again while dealing with the original crime. There’s a booming industry of criminals who target people at their worst moments, squeezing more money or information out of them in exchange for false hope. They’ll promise to get you back into a   account or reclaim money you lost to some other third party. They’re often lurking in legitimate-looking search results or your social media replies. What’s worse than falling victim to a scam online? Being scammed again while dealing with the original crime. There’s a booming industry of criminals who target people at their worst moments, squeezing more money or information out of them in exchange for false hope. They’ll promise to get you back into a   account or reclaim money you lost to some other third party. They’re often lurking in legitimate-looking search results or your social media replies. We’ve given  about what to do to avoid being scammed, but what about right after it happens? You’re still vulnerable and in a heightened emotional state, something that online criminals often count on. “People are especially digitally vulnerable after facing a cyberattack or when they need support after a cyberattack,” says Allie Mellen, a principal analyst at Forrester. “For those that may not be technically savvy or may not have a technically savvy family member or friend to help, an offer for tech support can be very welcome, right up until it turns out to be a fraud.” Americans lost nearly   to scams in 2022, according to Federal Trade Commission data. So far in 2023, online shopping scams are the most common, followed by criminals impersonating businesses, but tech support scams have cost consumers $157.8 million in the first three quarters of the year. Here are some guidelines to get you through the rough patch without losing more money — and be better prepared for next time. In the immediate aftermath of a scam, your priority is to prevent any additional damage. If you’ve handed over financial information or given money to a scammer, call your bank, credit card company, payment app or other financial institution. Many banks and cards will cover scams and return lost money, so ask them for a refund or to reverse the transaction. If you’ve only given personal information, it could still be used to steal your identity. Turn on credit fraud monitoring or, if you’re able, . If it’s a specific account that’s been hacked, report it to the company and — if you can — message your friends and family to let them know. Scammers who take over one account can then pose as you to get money or information from people you know. Change the passwords on any compromised accounts, following  : Never reuse a password, don’t pick anything obvious, and record it someplace safe such as a password manager. Next, turn on multifactor authentication for all your key accounts: financial, email, messaging and social media. If you’re not confident in your tech skills or need help, contact a friend or family member. Don’t worry about feeling embarrassed; just pick up the phone. They may also be able to use their own social media accounts to report yours as hacked. Try a company’s official customer support options. You’ll get help from banks and credit cards, but large tech companies with free products, such as Facebook and Google, typically don’t provide a way to speak to a person or get more than a support document or automated reply. Do not rely on search engines to find help. Scammers will often buy search ads for keywords about falling for scams, getting into hacked accounts, or recovering money or cryptocurrency. Others will automatically reply to any public social media post about being scammed, offering help. Skip them all. Especially any company you’ve never heard of or one that asks for a fee upfront. They don’t have any special back channels to tech companies or all-powerful hackers on staff to undo what’s been done, experts say. The most a service can do is walk you through securing your accounts or do some of the reporting for you. “If it’s very high up in search, that doesn’t mean it’s real. It means they paid for it,” said Iskander Sanchez-Rola, director of privacy innovation for Norton. Look out for long, overly specific URLs, sites that haven’t been around for very long and offers that seem too good to be true. For example, if a company is not asking for money upfront, that could mean it is in the information-gathering phase, says Sanchez-Rola. Do a search of the company’s name on Google, Reddit, Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau, and remember that positive online reviews can be faked (look closely at the language and the dates the reviews were posted). Look out for any company asking for nontraditional payment methods such as gift cards, Venmo or PayPal, or wire transfers. After you’ve handled all the emergency matters, report any scam or scammers to help protect other people. There’s an overwhelming number of options for where to report things, and they vary by country or state, what methods the scammers used and how much money you lost. If a crime has taken place, you can report it to your local law enforcement first. There’s usually a non-emergency number or site, and you might be able to fill out a form. Next, look up your state’s resources on where to report scams, starting with the attorney general’s office or the department of consumer affairs. Use keywords such as “cybercrime” or “ecrime” when searching for the best agencies, and be extra careful of sites posing as official government agencies — look for sites ending in .gov or .us. You can also report scams to private organizations that track cybercrime. Here is a list to get you started: To spread the word less officially, start with your social networks. Make a quick post about what the scam looked like to warn your friends and relatives, especially if you think scammers collected any of their information. If you’re comfortable, you can share information more widely on public accounts and sites such as Reddit. Finally, report any website, phone number or social media account belonging to a scammer to relevant tech companies — search engines, social media companies and cell carriers. Scams can affect anyone, no matter your age. If you do fall for one, use it as a learning experience so it won’t happen again.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/29/what-do-scammed-money-victim-fraud/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 06:00:00,

Mason Lohrei and Morgan Geekie also scored for the Bruins, who ended a four-game losing streak. Jeremy Swayman made 25 saves. “As a group, obviously, we didn’t like how we ended the break,” forward Jake DeBrusk said. “Had a couple days to reset and came out with a good effort tonight, had some good goaltending and just rolled with it.” Erik Johnson scored for the Sabres. Devon Levi made 21 saves. Special teams played a big role in the outcome as the Bruins scored on their first three power-play chances. Meanwhile, the Sabres went 0 for 6 with the man advantage. “Bottom line is special teams, no doubt,” Johnson said. “They scored when they needed to and they capitalized on their chances, especially on the power play. That was the difference.” Lohrei opened the scoring 4:19 in, sending the rebound of a shot past Levi. Coyle stretched the lead to two goals, scoring on a power play with 6:18 left in the first period. Jake DeBrusk got the puck behind the Buffalo net and spotted a wide-open Coyle in front of the Buffalo crease. Coyle then buried a one-timer. Coyle scored his second power-play goal of the game 4:18 into the second, when his shot deflected off Johnson’s skate into the net. “We always want to get out to a lead if you can, and then it’s up to us to push that lead, build in our game, play the right way,” Coyle said. “We’ve just got to keep building on our game.” Geekie made it 4-0 with 6:16 left in the second on another power-play goal for the Bruins. After Charlie McAvoy’s shot bounced off the end boards, Geekie fired the puck toward the net and a sprawling Levi was unable to make the save. It was Geekie’s fourth goal in seven games. Johnson got the Sabres on the board 5:11 into the third, scoring on a slap shot from the right circle. Tage Thompson, Buffalo’s No. 1 center, missed the game due to personal reasons.

"The Sidwell Friends girls’ basketball team left for Hawaii last week in the hopes of putting a rare defeat in the rearview mirror. Since 2020, the No. 1 Quakers have lost just four games. Two have come in December, when the team often takes on a relentless, national nonconference schedule. Their second game of this season was against Pennsylvania’s Westtown, and it ended in a 52-49 defeat. The Sidwell Friends girls’ basketball team left for Hawaii last week in the hopes of putting a rare defeat in the rearview mirror. Since 2020, the No. 1 Quakers have lost just four games. Two have come in December, when the team often takes on a relentless, national nonconference schedule. Their second game of this season was against Pennsylvania’s Westtown, and it ended in a 52-49 defeat. “I think we got better in that game,” Coach Tamika Dudley said. “Yes, we took a loss, but I think we showed some glimpses of what this group can really be. … I want to be realistic. We’re not going to win every single game. But it’s about what you take away from each game.” Four days later, Sidwell left for Hawaii. The Quakers were taking part in the ’Iolani Classic, a prestigious eight-team, three-day tournament in Honolulu. Dudley viewed the trip as beneficial on two fronts: It gave her team a chance to test itself against more elite opposition, and it provided time to build early-season chemistry. In between games, the group went to a luau, hit the beach and visited Pearl Harbor. On the court, the Quakers showed no signs of discouragement after the loss to Westtown. They topped Hawaii’s Kamehameha Kapalama in the quarterfinals and California’s Clovis West in the semifinals. In the championship game against national power Sierra Canyon, Sidwell emerged with a gritty 49-48 win. Senior forward Zania Socka-Nguemen, a UCLA commit, scored the winning basket off an inbound play with four seconds left. “I saw resilience in Hawaii,” Dudley said. “You always want to see if your team has the heart to push through some adversity early, and I think they did that. Each game challenged us in a different way.” Sidwell (4-1) was originally scheduled to go to Florida soon after the trip to Hawaii, but that event was canceled shortly before the season. So the team now has a break of nearly a month: Its next game is Jan. 4 against Independent School League foe Bullis. “I’m a big believer in using Christmastime to rest, train, recover and prepare for the second half of the season,” Dudley said. “I’m never afraid of giving them time off.” There was a face-scrunching, ball-slamming frustration that came with playing the Marshall boys last year. Nobody in Northern Virginia was slower — and flourished more at that pace — than the Statesmen’s University of Virginia-style pack-line defense, which held teams to 41.2 points per game and helped deliver a 22-4 record. A year later, the Statesmen are 7-0, conceding even fewer points. But their identity as an irritant has taken on a new form: They’re flying. “It’s exciting,” Marshall Coach Jerry Lin said. “We’re getting up and down, shooting more threes. We’re adapting.” Since taking over at Marshall in 2019, Lin has shown enthusiasm for tailoring the Statesmen’s system around their personnel. That meant with the graduation of Marshall’s entire frontcourt and district player of the year Matthew Lenert, the Statesmen dropped height for hustle. Their undersized top three — seniors Jose Fudd, Jason Penn and Omar Phillips — have enjoyed the pace and open looks, but they feel there’s more work to be done. Fudd, who got stronger this past summer and has thrived as a stretch forward, is still getting in sync with the guards. The team’s stamina improved in the offseason, though with pace came turnovers. “In our fall league, Lin said we looked like we were in midseason form,” Fudd said. “But we can’t be stuck in midseason form. We have to be even better.” Adaptability makes Marshall a viable candidate to stick around Northern Virginia’s upper rung. Friday’s 54-47 win over rival Madison, which avenged last season’s region semifinal loss to the Warhawks, was indicative of as much — and demonstrated the effectiveness of Marshall’s system. Fudd connected on six threes, most of which came from NBA range. Two of those threes, plus a charge drawn by 5-foot-7 guard Osteen Suguru, sealed the game in the final minute. “He plays like he’s 7 feet tall,” Penn said of Suguru. “He’s a dog.” The senior dropped 42 points for the Ramblers in a 70-48 win over Coolidge. Eastern is 4-1 under new coach Lonnie Harrell after a winless 2022-23 season. The marksman made 6 of 11 threes and scored 23 points Dec. 11 at Wheaton. He followed it up two days later by scoring a career-high 27 at Kennedy, making 7 of 8 long-range attempts. The Vikings have won four straight after a season-opening loss.  Before Friday, Robinson hadn’t allowed a team to score 40 points since last year’s season opener. Then came Rahman, who scored 17 points  . Her efforts lift Langley into the Top 20. The sophomore wing scored 20 points as the Warriors beat Philadelphia power West Catholic, 70-43, at the inaugural Champions Classic at St. John’s.  Monday, 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, 7:30 p.m.  Thursday, 7:30 p.m. Friday, 6:45 p.m. Howard got a long-awaited coronation in last year’s Maryland Class 3A girls’ state championship.  crowned the Lions for the first time since 1994 and felt like the culmination of a dominant climb. Howard went 70-2 over the past three seasons and entered this year on a 58-game winning streak against county foes. The title looked to be the end of that run. Sixty-three of the Lions’ 64 points in that championship game were scored by departing players — seniors Gabrielle Kennerly, Samiyah Nasir and Jenna Vetter and sophomore star Meghan Yarnevich, who transferred to Bullis. Some wondered if Scott Robinson, who has coached Howard since 2011, would step away and go out on top. Robinson reflected on that decision for a few weeks after the season, he said, but returned. “I just thought, as long as I had the health to be able to do it, that I wanted to do it,” he said. The Lions (4-2) are not the juggernaut they had been, but they have won their first four Howard County games to extend their streak to 62. They started the season by holding one of the county’s top contenders, River Hill, to 28 points in a five-point victory. Howard has held its opponent below 30 points in each of its wins. The lone returning scorer from the win over Poly, Alana Harrison, has been an impactful defender. Senior Oluwadamilola Daniel leads the Lions in scoring after coming off the bench last season. “We just have to play hard. Nothing’s going to come easy,” Robinson said. “Hard work is going to be the only way that we’re going to be successful.” Gwynn Park boys’ coach Rob Garner has watched his core group of seniors grow together for years inside gymnasiums across Prince George’s County. Several of the Yellow Jackets have played four years of varsity basketball with one another, making this season the last time they can chase a state title together. “We kind of copycat the documentary with the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan, when he talked about ‘The Last Dance,’ ” Garner said. “… We say it every day.” The season is still young for the tightknit squad, but the Yellow Jackets have impressed early. Gwynn Park has won each of its first four games by at least 20 points, including a dominant 77-44 win over High Point on Saturday in the DMV Tip-Off Classic in Waldorf. The Yellow Jackets’ three best players — seniors Demarcus Daniel Jr., Tony Pope and Ty Bevins — have played together throughout their tenures at Gwynn Park. Pope and Bevins go back further, having grown up playing youth league basketball together since they were 7 years old. Daniel led the way in his team’s latest win, contributing 29 points, eight rebounds and four steals. Pope recorded 21 points and six assists.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/18/sidwell-benefits-trip-hawaii-marshall-swaps-height-hustle/,Washington Post,2023-12-18 11:32:00,

The Lakers scored a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers in the championship game at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, claiming the title thanks to their punishing style and just enough late-game resolve.

LAS VEGAS — LeBron James hugged his Los Angeles Lakers teammates, donned a commemorative hat and lifted the   over his head with both hands in a joyous, but not overly emotional, conclusion to the inaugural in-season tournament. The Lakers scored a 123-109 victory over the Indiana Pacers in the championship game at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, claiming the title thanks to their punishing style and just enough late-game resolve. James finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds and four assists to earn tournament MVP honors, adding to his four regular season MVPs, four Finals MVPs and three All-Star Game MVPs. Anthony Davis added 41 points, 20 rebounds and five assists, pounding away against an overmatched Pacers front line from start to finish. Each Lakers player earned a $500,000 bonus as tournament champions, while each Pacers player took home $200,000 as the runners-up. “Records will be broken, but one thing that will never be broken is being the first to do something,” James said. “We’re the first champions of the in-season tournament and nobody can ever top that.” In the quiet moments after the trophy presentation, James munched on grapes at his locker, packed his body with ice and gifted his Cup-winning sneakers to longtime Nike executive Lynn Merritt. James handed off his MVP trophy to Maverick Carter, his longtime business partner, and chatted with Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul at the end of a long weekend. The Lakers’ cork-popping was confined to an auxiliary room and seemingly over before it started. The Lakers looked and acted like a team that was proud that it handled its business going 4-0 in the group stage before beating the Phoenix Suns, New Orleans Pelicans and Pacers in the knockout round, but their understated celebration was a far cry from the tearful and champagne-soaked scene following their  . Lakers owner Jeanie Buss wasn’t on hand for the trophy presentation, and it remains unclear whether the franchise will hang a banner to recognize the tournament title at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Though the NBA Cup and its accompanying riches were something to compete for early in the season, the event paled in comparison to what’s coming in the playoffs, especially for a franchise that has won 17 championships. “We want to put it in perspective that it’s still December,” James said. “We like where we are right now but we want to continue to work our habits, continue to get healthy as well. Right now, where we are in December, I would take it. But I’m definitely not looking to May and June. That’s too far.” The in-season tournament’s 67th game proved to be a fervent finale for an event that largely exceeded expectations by delivering intense elimination games and improved television ratings. Neither team built a double-digit lead until Los Angeles went up 70-60 early in the third quarter, and a nonstop stream of officiating complaints from both sides confirmed this was a more serious occasion than a typical regular season game. “I will say, in terms of the interest we are seeing around the in-season tournament, I don’t think it was just the money,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Saturday. “I think it was the competition, in part. I think it was coming to Vegas. I think it was all those things that made the difference. I should say also that players like LeBron, [Stephen Curry] and other leading veterans in this league embracing this from day one makes a big difference with the players.” Both the Lakers and Pacers entered Saturday’s final with identical 6-0 tournament records and differing motivations: James wanted to put his stamp on the new event while making his case to one day own an NBA franchise in Las Vegas, while Tyrese Haliburton and his small-market teammates wanted to introduce themselves to a national television audience while getting valuable experience for the playoffs. Sin City was anything but a neutral site: Lakers fans outnumbered Pacers fans at least 20-1 in a sold-out crowd of more than 19,000, and boos rained down when James uncharacteristically found himself in early foul trouble. The 38-year-old forward picked up two fouls in the first quarter before wrestling with Aaron Nesmith to earn his third with more than three minutes left before halftime. Lakers Coach Darvin Ham challenged the call, and James protested at length, but their efforts proved unsuccessful. Davis and Austin Reaves picked up the slack in James’s absence, helping the Lakers claim a 65-60 halftime lead by attacking the heart of the Pacers’ defense. Davis piled up 13 points and eight rebounds in the first quarter, and Reaves scored 22 of his 28 points before halftime. “That was a Shaq-like dominant performance,” James said of Davis. The Lakers’ cast of long and aggressive perimeter defenders was difficult for Haliburton to crack: The Pacers’ star guard had a three-pointer blocked and tossed up an air ball under duress in the early going, and he finished with 20 points and 11 assists, never looking as comfortable as he had while knocking out the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks. While Indiana enjoyed a memorable tournament run thanks to its free-flowing, league-leading attack, its offense stalled Saturday, buoyed by a parade to the free throw line in the first half and several sloppy Los Angeles turnovers late in the third quarter. The Lakers squandered possessions with an illegal screen, an over-and-back violation and a bad pass in quick succession, and Bennedict Mathurin hit a running three-pointer to beat the third-quarter buzzer to help the trailing Pacers maintain contact. Down the stretch, the Pacers’ frontcourt ultimately proved unable to withstand the Lakers’ bludgeoning. Indiana center Myles Turner played just 25 minutes because of persistent foul trouble, and he fouled out with more than four minutes remaining. Turner’s undersized replacements struggled to keep Davis and James from scoring inside; Los Angeles racked up 86 points in the paint. “We’ve been doing it together for a long time, five years now,” Davis said of his partnership with James. “We just figure it out. We know each other’s tendencies, what we like to do. Obviously in crunchtime, we get to our infamous pick-and-roll and it’s tough to stop. We feed off one another.” A well-rested James, who played just 23 minutes in the Lakers’   Thursday before watching from the sideline for chunks of the first half Saturday, slammed the door with a double-clutch dunk with a little more than two minutes to play. Soon after, Pacers Coach Rick Carlisle waved the white flag by emptying his bench and Silver handed out the hardware. “Frankly, there’s nothing else to win in this league,” Silver said to James, before alluding to the 19-time all-star’s dream of owning an expansion team in Las Vegas once he retires. “I’m sorry, but [the MVP trophy] doesn’t come with a franchise.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/09/lakers-win-season-tournament-nba-cup/,Washington Post,2023-12-10 01:27:00,

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Sebastian Aho scored a goal and assisted on three others to lead the Carolina Hurricanes to a 5-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Wednesday night. Andrei Svechnikov, Brent Burns and Seth Jarvis each had a goal and an assist and Jack Drury also scored for Carolina, which had lost two in a row. Pyotr Kochetkov made a season-high 35 saves. “We scored, which was nice,” Carolina coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “The power play was good, obviously connecting and then I thought (Kochetkov) played really well. At the end of the day, that’s the difference. He was solid (and) he outplayed the other guy. If we can get that, then we have a chance.” Ryan O’Reilly had a goal and an assist and Gustav Nyquist also scored while Juuse Saros made 14 saves for Nashville, which has dropped three of four. Aho scored the game’s first goal at 9:50 of the opening period. With the Hurricanes on power play, Aho snapped off a wrist shot from the top of the left circle that deflected off the skate of Predators defenseman Luke Schenn and snuck by Saros on the short side. The goal was the 500th point of Aho’s NHL career. He’s been nearly a point-per-game player in his career, with Wednesday marking his 552nd game played. His four points were a season high and his three assists tied a career high. Burns doubled the Carolina lead with 4:52 remaining in the first, also on the power play. “It’s hard to win in this league when you’re chasing the game,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. The Hurricanes were 3 of 6 on the power play and are 5 of 10 in the last two games. “It’s clicking,” Aho said of the power play. “It feeds the confidence when you get a couple of goals there. As of late, we’ve been pretty solid executing those plays.” Nyquist scored at 1:18 of the second. Just after the puck went into the net, Svechnikov collided with Nyquist and Nyquist remained down on the ice before heading to the dressing room. He returned later in the period. Svechnikov was initially assessed a major penalty on the play, but the penalty was rescinded upon video review. He scored just 2:26 later. O’Reilly scored a power-play goal at 5:08 of the second, but Drury restored Carolina’s two-goal lead at 9:56. “We started good and did a lot of good things,” O’Reilly said. “The penalty kill wasn’t our best, a few bad bounces on there too, which just kind of sparked them.” Jarvis scored Carolina’s third power-play goal of the game with 2:06 remaining in the second. Yaroslav Askarov replaced Saros to start the third period. Askarov was recalled from Milwaukee of the AHL earlier Wednesday when Kevin Lankinen was unavailable due to an illness. Making his second career appearance, Askarov stopped all six shots he faced. UP NEXT Hurricanes: Host Montreal Thursday.

Way, a   with a 118.7 career quarterback rating, didn’t get a chance to add to his passing numbers against the Giants. Way wouldn’t have been so busy if Washington’s offense did a better job sustaining drives. After converting 2 of 10 third downs in last week’s ugly win at Atlanta, the Commanders were 1 of 15 on third down against the Giants. Washington has failed to convert a single third down three times before, including in its infamous   on “Monday Night Football” in 2010, but Sunday marked the first time Washington had converted one or fewer third downs on at least 15 attempts. The Giants had been allowing opponents to convert at a 43.7 percent rate, the seventh-worst mark in the league. Young, who was limited to three games at the end of last year after recovering from a serious knee injury, has played well since returning from a neck injury that sidelined him for the first game of the season. Taking advantage of the Giants’ makeshift offensive line, Young registered the first two-sack game of his career, accounting for half of the Commanders’ sacks of backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor. “We lost,” Young, who had three tackles for loss,  . “Don’t care.” .  gets sack No. 4 on the season 📺  : CBS  Linebacker Micah McFadden and defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence combined to sack Sam Howell on Washington’s opening drive, which was the first of eight Commanders possessions to end with a three-and-out. Howell was sacked five more times by a Giants defense that entered the game with five sacks in six weeks, bringing his season total to an NFL-worst 40. Howell is on pace to take 97 sacks, which would shatter David Carr’s record of 76 set in 2002. It wasn’t until Week 8 of that 16-game campaign that Carr was sacked fewer than four times in a game. Howell, who is only nine sacks shy of matching the single-season franchise record shared by Trent Green (1998) and Norm Snead (1961), can only hope he’s so lucky when the Eagles visit FedEx Field on Sunday. At this rate, it’ll be a wonder if he stays healthy enough to play 17 games. Sam Howell has been sacked 40 times - the Washington franchise record is 49 in a season by Trent Green (‘98) and Norm Snead (‘61) both in 14 games … At this pace Sam would set the record in 9 games 😬 Again, it was that type of day. The Giants   from the 1980s and ’90s for a couple of games last year and broke them out for the first time this season against Washington. The old-school helmet logo at midfield and period-appropriate “GIANTS” word marks in the end zones added to the look, which brought back memories of NFC East showdowns at Giants Stadium during Washington’s glory years. (The Kelly green   in their win over the Dolphins on “Sunday Night Football” were gorgeous, too.) Classic field design returns for Legacy games  The Commanders managed 46 yards in the first half while passing twice as often as they ran the ball. Rather than calling quick passes, dialing up screens or handing the ball off in an attempt to neutralize New York’s effective pass rush, Washington continued to have Howell drop back. The results were predictably ugly as Howell took as many sacks (five) as he had completions through two quarters. Coordinator Eric Bieniemy seemed to make some adjustments in the fourth quarter, which produced a couple of long drives. The first ended in a blocked field goal after Coach Ron Rivera decided not to go for it on fourth and three. The second resulted in a turnover on downs. Washington’s seven points were the fewest allowed by New York since 2021. Disappointing 14-7 loss for my Commanders to the NY Giants. It’s hard to win in the NFL when you only score 7 points. The scoreboard would’ve more accurately reflected how badly the Commanders were outplayed if not for a couple of Giants turnovers and New York linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux dropping a gift-wrapped interception return for a touchdown. A muffed punt by Sterling Shepard led to a 21-yard touchdown drive by the Commanders early in the third quarter. With the Giants driving for the potential game-clinching score midway through the fourth quarter, Daron Payne forced and recovered a fumble by Saquon Barkley to give the Commanders’ offense one last chance. The loss was Washington’s first when winning the turnover battle since Week 15 of 2021. Dotson isn’t the reason Washington fell to 3-4, but his drop on Howell’s fourth-down pass in the final minute sealed the Commanders’ fate. “I make those plays all the time with my eyes closed, so not being able to make that play, it hurts for sure,”  , which came on a throw that was slightly behind him. Dotson, who averaged 15 yards per catch and scored seven touchdowns as a rookie last season, hasn’t replicated that success this year. He caught the tying touchdown on the final play of regulation against the Eagles for his only score of 2023 but had a costly drop earlier in that game and dropped his only target last week. Isaiah Simmons biggest play as a Giant? Dotson has to catch this, but the throw is slightly off target due to Simmons forcing Howell out of the pocket.

"Washington’s offense followed one of its worst performances of the season with one of its best. Employing a quick passing scheme, the Commanders moved the ball effectively against an Eagles defense that limited the high-powered Dolphins to 17 points a week ago. Washington was 7 for 12 on third down after converting only 3 0f 25 third downs over its previous two games combined, and the Commanders scored their most points in four games. Perhaps most impressively, Bieniemy’s game plan helped keep quarterback Sam Howell on his feet. After being sacked at least four times in every game this season, Howell was sacked just once Sunday. (It came in an awful situation, resulting in a turnover on downs deep in Washington territory in the fourth quarter, but still, it was progress.) The Commanders finished with 472 yards, their most since a win over the Raiders in 2017. Washington’s offense followed one of its worst performances of the season with one of its best.

(It came in an awful situation, resulting in a turnover on downs deep in Washington territory in the fourth quarter, but still, it was progress.) The Commanders finished with 472 yards, their most since a win over the Raiders in 2017. NFL teams that score 31 points and rack up more than 450 yards — especially teams that have spent first-round draft picks on defenders in six of the past seven years — are supposed to win, and indeed Washington was 8-2 before Sunday when hitting those benchmarks dating from 2005. Amid speculation that the Commanders might look to   on expiring contracts for draft picks ahead of Tuesday’s trade deadline, Del Rio’s unit was shredded again. Washington’s defense started strong, forcing a three-and-out on the Eagles’ first possession and limiting Philadelphia to 10 first-half points, but fell apart in the second half. If not for a pair of lost fumbles near the goal line, the Eagles might have scored 50 point. Washington only sacked Jalen Hurts, who was clearly hobbled by a knee injury, twice. A.J. Brown repeatedly torched defenders and made Del Rio look foolish for having rookie cornerback Emmanuel Forbes Jr. attempt to cover him. Fellow wideout DeVonta Smith got  open for the easiest 38-yard touchdown pass you’ll ever see — at least until the Commanders make Patriots quarterback Mac Jones look like vintage Tom Brady next week. DeVonta Smith was WIDE OPEN and it's all tied up again! (via  ) Bieniemy put Howell in position to succeed, but credit the young quarterback for playing a near-perfect game for three quarters. Howell was 24 for 26 for 226 yards and two touchdowns in the first half and finished with 397 yards and four touchdowns — both career highs. One of Washington’s most impressive drives came just before halftime, when Howell moved the Commanders 37 yards on four consecutive completions in 33 seconds to set up Joey Slye’s 61-yard field goal. Howell’s interception midway through the fourth quarter — his first turnover against the Eagles in two games — was costly, but Sunday was his best performance of the season. The Commanders had plenty of opportunities to win after the Eagles tied the score at 17 on Brown’s second touchdown catch with 4:17 remaining in the third quarter, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that Rivera made an egregious mistake by not challenging what was ruled a fourth-down catch by Smith to extend the drive three plays earlier. Hurts’s pass appeared to hit the ground before Smith completed the catch, which came in front of the Commanders’ sideline and prompted several Washington players in the vicinity to signal that it was incomplete. Philadelphia hurried to the line and snapped the ball before Rivera challenged the call. “I didn’t see it on the screen,”  . “I was looking up at the screen to see if there was something that could help me with it. Then I was waiting to hear somebody upstairs on if they had seen it or not. We hadn’t seen the replay, so we weren’t sure.” Commanders owner Josh Harris bolstered the team’s analytics department by   last week, and that’s all well and good, but could he please find someone to let Rivera know when to throw his red challenge flag, or maybe ask the scoreboard operator to show replays in a more timely fashion? Dotson, who hadn’t made much of an impact in the first seven games and dropped the potential game-tying touchdown last week against the Giants, caught eight passes for 108 yards and his second touchdown of the year. Dotson’s career game ended on a sour note after officials in the NFL’s replay command center ruled his apparent juggling catch to extend a drive late in the fourth quarter was incomplete. SAM. HAN. TOUCHDOWN.  📺  : FOX  Washington was 6 for 9 on fourth down this season before going 0 for 3 in Sunday’s loss. On fourth and one from Philadelphia’s 35-yard line in the second quarter, Rivera kept his offense on the field rather than attempt a long field goal. Operating out of the shotgun, Howell sent running back Brian Robinson Jr. in motion before throwing an incomplete pass that was nearly intercepted by James Bradberry. McLaurin dropped a low fourth-down throw by Howell in the fourth quarter with Washington driving for the potential tying score, and Howell’s only sack came on fourth down on the Commanders’ next possession. Making a rare appearance at FedEx Field since he retired after the 2002 season, Pro Football Hall of Famer Darrell Green, the Commanders’ honorary “Legend of the Game,” was asked what advice he would give Forbes, who has struggled as a rookie. “Truthfully, I can help him in 10 minutes, 20 minutes,” Green, who was drafted in the first round 40 years before Washington selected Forbes 16th overall, said of his fellow cornerback. “I’m going to cross the line that I know I’m going to cross, [but] he’s not getting the help that he should get. That’s all I’m going to say about that. But I like him. … I believe in him.” Green hasn’t followed individual Commanders players closely in recent years, but he said he took an interest in Forbes after seeing a video after the draft of a fan   that he needed to study tape of Green’s career. Darrell Green hasn’t talked to Emmanuel Forbes, but after watching  him, he believes he’s “not getting the help he should get.”  In a familiar scene, FedEx Field looked and sounded like an Eagles home game. Daniel Snyder may be gone, but it’ll take more changes and more time for the Commanders to experience anything resembling home-field advantage when NFC East rivals visit Landover.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/30/commanders-eagles-highlights-and-lowlights/,Washington Post,2023-10-30 10:14:00,

LOUIS — Jake Neighbours and Marco Scandella each scored and goalie Joel Hofer recorded 39 saves to lead the St. Louis Blues to a 2-1 victory over the Dallas Stars on Wednesday night following a three-day break in the NHL calendar. The loss snapped a three-game winning streak for Dallas. Hofer registered 37 saves in his previous start, a 4-1   last Thursday. He improved to 7-5-0 this season. “It was a good challenge,” Hofer said. “Those are the kinds of games you look forward to, especially a divisional rival. It was a lot of fun and obviously we got the win, which made it even better. I’m feeling good.” Dallas goalie Scott Wedgewood took the loss after he had recorded a point in each of his previous 10 decisions (8-0-2). He made 28 saves. “Someone has to start on the road,” Wedgewood said. “Obviously, not getting any points is tough. I feel for the guys. They battled. We just came out on the wrong side of it.” Jason Robertson scored for the Stars. It was the first of three games in the four days for the Blues. Neighbours put St. Louis up 1-0 at 18:08 of the first period. He scored his 12th goal with a one-timer on a pass from Scott Perunovich. The Blues took a 2-0 lead at 10:53 on a goal by Scandella. Kasperi Kapanen passed to Scandella, who snapped a wrist shot in by Wedgewood from the top of the right circle. “We’re playing together; we’re supporting each other,” Scandella said. “I just feel like we have to keep the momentum going.” A high-sticking double minor penalty was called at 14:16 and a delaying game penalty was called less than two minutes later. That gave the Blues a two-man advantage for two minutes late in the period. Scandella was cut on the high-sticking call. He needed three stitches to close the wound. “Hazards of the game,” Scandella said. The Blues took eight shots on the long power play but failed to dent Wedgewood. “We’ve got a lot of confidence in our penalty kill,” Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. “You never want to give up a goal in a 5-on-3 for two minutes. That’s what we were staring at tonight. We knew if they scored there, it was probably game over. There was a lot of desperation on our part.” The momentum shifted quickly after that. Dallas made the Blues pay when Justin Faulk turned the puck over. Robertson beat Hofer at 18:31 of the second period. “I just got on the ice and I was kind of fresh,” Robertson said. “I was trying to get open and they found me and I was able to score.” That goal was all Hofer allowed from the Stars. “I thought Joel was outstanding,” Blues interim coach Drew Bannister said. “He was great on the PK for us early on when we had to make those two kills. He made some key saves for us in the third, too, with some difficult saves in tight. He was outstanding from the beginning right till the end.” UP NEXT: Stars: Host Chicago on Friday night.

Mike Thibault sat on the event level of Entertainment and Sports Arena on Thursday, following his first season as the Washington Mystics’ general manager without coaching responsibilities, and acknowledged the organization has reached a transitional period. The Mystics’ 2023 season   on Tuesday night, when Washington was eliminated in the first round of the postseason for the third time since it won the  . The loss may ultimately mark the beginning of a significant shift in what the team has looked like since franchise cornerstone  . “[Transition] is a word that can be used a little bit,” Thibault said. “I think we have to make a decision about what this is going to look like going forward. And it’s not an easy one.” The Mystics have been operating with a core group they felt was championship caliber since they traded for Delle Donne, a two-time league MVP. This year’s roster featured Delle Donne, Ariel Atkins, Natasha Cloud, Myisha Hines-Allen, Tianna Hawkins, Shatori Walker-Kimbrough and Kristi Toliver. All seven were on the rosters that made back-to-back Finals appearances in 2018 and 2019 and won the 2019 title. Hawkins, Walker-Kimbrough and Toliver all went elsewhere and returned, but those have been the key pieces of the past six seasons. Injuries have been a major hindrance for multiple years — players missed a combined 53 regular season games this season — but Delle Donne admitted that any season that doesn’t end in a championship is a disappointment. That’s the standard the Mystics have set. Now there are decisions to make. Delle Donne, Cloud, Hawkins and Toliver are unrestricted free agents, and both the players and the organization must figure out how they want to proceed. Delle Donne is the biggest question. She’s a seven-time all-star, including this season, and an Olympian who has long been considered one of the best players on the planet. A pair of back surgeries, plus two ankle injuries and a hip injury this season, have limited her to just 51 games since she signed a supermax deal before the 2020 season. Delle Donne said she hadn’t thought much about free agency when she met with reporters Wednesday, but she said she and her wife, Amanda, would do what’s best for their family. Delle Donne has previously said she didn’t ever plan to play for another organization, but she did not say that Wednesday. “I think you always need to take a little bit of time to just kind of reflect and see what your next steps are going to be,” Delle Donne said. “I just want to win. That’s truly what I care about most. It’s been my whole career, but especially coming back from all the back stuff and feeling like I’m really the strongest I’ve ever been. I’m in great shape. I feel like I have a lot more basketball to play, and I want to win.” The Mystics, meanwhile, must determine how Delle Donne fits in their plans. She played well enough to earn the all-star appearance and had strong efficiency stats, shooting 48.5 percent from the field, 39.3 percent from three-point range and 93.8 percent from the free throw line. But her 16.7 points per game were a career low for seasons in which she played more than three games. She has averaged 11.3 points and 3.7 rebounds in the Mystics’ past three playoff games dating from last season, and the team is 0-5 in the postseason since it was crowned champion. “I think the most encouraging thing is that she clearly views herself as having a lot of really good basketball left in her,” Coach Eric Thibault said. “And that gives me a lot of confidence that that’s true, quite frankly. “I don’t think it’s fair necessarily to ask her to carry the load she carried when she was 27, 28, 29. But she can still be a big-time player, there’s no doubt about that.” But can the team still build around Delle Donne at 34 in the same way it did when she first arrived in Washington? “I think that’s the discussion we’re having, and I really can’t give you that answer,” Mike Thibault said. “I would say that anytime you have some of your players getting older, whether she was a free agent or not, we need to make sure that we have other players that we can make focal parts of what we do. It can’t just be one player.” Cloud also will be a major factor this offseason because she is expected to draw significant interest from other teams. She gave a strong final impression, scoring a career-high 33 points and adding nine assists, six rebounds and four steals in the elimination game Tuesday to become the first player in WNBA history to record 30 or more points, five or more assists, five or more rebounds and four or more steals in a playoff game. Cloud averaged a career-high 12.7 points this season after she was forced to carry more of an offensive load when the team was missing three starters for a long stretch. Last year, Cloud led the league with seven assists per game. She has been a starter since 2018 and is a leader in the locker room and the community. “I feel like I’m a player that you should want to play with, you should want to coach,” Cloud said. “I’m fiery. I’m gritty. Going to run through a wall every single night. I’m going to give it my best every single night. I’m going to lead. I’m going to be able to orchestrate. I’m QB1.” The Mystics have missed the playoffs just twice since Mike Thibault arrived before the 2013 season, with six of their nine postseason appearances during his tenure coming since Delle Donne arrived. Championship aspirations remained this season before the injuries derailed them. Now the team enters a period that Mike Thibault said will be hard to predict. The team holds three picks over the next two years in drafts that are expected to be deep with talent. Also on the horizon are possible changes in the league’s collective bargaining agreement, potential expansion and a new media deal. All of those factors could affect team finances, and many players are expected to sign two-year deals in anticipation of possible structural changes in 2025. The key word for Mike Thibault is flexibility because the path to improvement isn’t as clear as it has been in previous offseasons. “We have to kind of really spend this offseason nitpicking a lot of things,” Mike Thibault said. “ There is no easy, quick fix for anything. You can’t box yourself into a corner where you’re an old team and you have older players on long-term contracts. That’s the simplest way I can answer that right now.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/09/21/mystics-offseason-elena-delle-donne/,Washington Post,2023-09-21 19:40:00,
"LOS ANGELES — The line of cardinal-clad students snaked along Flower Street for more than two blocks, an unusual showing of Sunday morning enthusiasm for the unranked Southern California men’s basketball team. But the teens took their places on the sidewalk and made sure they were more than two hours early, queuing up as they would for an exclusive sneaker release or as their older siblings might for a table at a hot brunch spot. They came dressed for the occasion in a sometimes-clashing assortment of jerseys: red-and-white Trojans jerseys with “James Jr.” on the back but also yellow Los Angeles Lakers jerseys and wine-colored Cleveland Cavaliers jerseys bearing the original “James.” LOS ANGELES — The line of cardinal-clad students snaked along Flower Street for more than two blocks, an unusual showing of Sunday morning enthusiasm for the unranked Southern California men’s basketball team. But the teens took their places on the sidewalk and made sure they were more than two hours early, queuing up as they would for an exclusive sneaker release or as their older siblings might for a table at a hot brunch spot. They came dressed for the occasion in a sometimes-clashing assortment of jerseys: red-and-white Trojans jerseys with “James Jr.” on the back but also yellow Los Angeles Lakers jerseys and wine-colored Cleveland Cavaliers jerseys bearing the original “James.” Such was the frenzy for a college debut that was months in the making: LeBron “Bronny” James Jr., the 19-year-old son of the Lakers star, took the court for the first time since he suffered  . Following   at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the Mayo Clinic and Morristown Medical Center who determined he had a treatable congenital heart defect, James was   and rejoined his team for practice last week. The step-by-step buildup led to James seeing his first college action in an 84-79 overtime loss to Long Beach State on Sunday at Galen Center. Coach Andy Enfield said James would come off the bench and be on a minutes restriction as he works into game shape, and the freshman guard finished with four points (on 1-for-3 shooting), three rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes. Long Beach State (7-4) spoiled James’s debut thanks to a game-high 28 points from Marcus Tsohonis. Vincent Iwuchukwu and Isaiah Collier led the Trojans (5-4) with 15 points apiece. “I just want to say I’m thankful for everything: [to] the Mayo Clinic and everything they helped me with [and] my parents and siblings for supporting me through this hard time in my life,” said James, who offered a brief postgame statement but did not take questions from reporters. “I just want to give appreciation for everyone who has helped me through this. Also, my coach and teammates have been with me since the start.” Though USC understandably sought to soft-launch James into action, the student section — often home to tumbleweeds — was filled to the brim more than an hour before the 1 p.m. tip-off. James entertained the eager crowd with pregame dunks as a Drake song boomed over the sound system. The Trojans have long been overshadowed by the crosstown UCLA Bruins and haven’t made the Final Four since 1954, but they clearly benefited from a “Bronny Bump” on Sunday: USC said it sold out the matinee against Long Beach State, a pedestrian Big West Conference opponent, and Enfield’s postgame news conference was a standing-room-only affair. “[James] went through a very unfortunate situation, and he’s done an incredible job getting back to this point,” he said. “The extra spotlight or eyeballs, sometimes that comes with a guy like Bronny, but we have to get better as a basketball team, and he has to keep improving as an individual player. That’s what we’re focused on.” Lakers’ LeBron James pulls up for Bronny James’s USC debut  LeBron James, fresh off   on Saturday night, made good on his pledge to see his eldest son’s first college game. The 38-year-old father of three took a courtside seat alongside his mother, Gloria, and his daughter, Zhuri, across from Long Beach State’s bench. When he entered the arena shortly before tip-off, he hugged Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka and then gave Bronny a love tap on the back as he stood alongside his teammates for the national anthem. Bronny James, a 6-foot-4 four-star recruit who   just north of Los Angeles, received a standing ovation when he entered the game wearing a white No. 6 jersey with 12:58 to go in the first half. His father and grandmother stood with their cellphones in hand to capture the moment. His brief first stint on the court included flashes of aggressive on-ball defense, a rebound and a missed three-pointer from the top of the arc on his first shot attempt. When he checked in again shortly before halftime, he soared for a chase-down block at the rim and cleanly dished to Iwuchukwu for an easy basket at the rim. James scored his first points midway through the second half, swishing a three-pointer to cash in on a transition opportunity. He didn’t hunt shots, preferring to make the extra pass to a teammate. As USC clung to a narrow lead, fans began shouting for Anfield to put James back in for crunchtime. Their pleas were answered; James returned for the final three-plus minutes of regulation, coming up with a steal and splitting a pair of free throws in the final 30 seconds to help force overtime. The Beach took command early in the extra period, and James watched the final two minutes from the sideline. “I thought [James] played very well,” Enfield said. “He defended at a high level, he rebounded, [got] two steals and two assists, made a three. I thought he was very solid.” LeBron James, who is in his 21st professional season, has long harbored the goal of playing with his son in the NBA as basketball’s answer to baseball’s Ken Griffey Sr. and Ken Griffey Jr. Several of James’s NBA colleagues, including former Miami Heat teammate Dwyane Wade and Phoenix Suns star Kevin Durant, welcomed the younger James back to the court on social media. “Watching Bronny walk out on that court gave me chills,”  . Before his health scare, James was seen as a possible first-round pick in the 2024 NBA draft should he decide to turn pro after his freshman season. How his heart issue might alter his professional ambitions remains unclear. For now, there are more important considerations. “It’s not just [seeing] Bronny at a game,” LeBron James said Wednesday. “It’s Bronny, period — to have the ability to be able to point at him and see him smiling and alive. It’s literally that simple, to have that moment with my son knowing the situation that happened earlier in the summer. I’m not saying I took it for granted before, but it puts everything in perspective for sure.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/10/bronny-james-debut-usc-lebron-james/,Washington Post,2023-12-10 19:39:00,
"Linda Portel has watched a barrage of presidential campaign commercials this year from her living room in Urbandale, Iowa. Many have faded from her memory. But one stuck with her: an ad attacking   that Portel viewed as sexist. The 30-second spot tying Haley to Hillary Clinton is just the kind of broadside that Portel, who is undecided, and other Haley admirers worry could derail the former U.N. ambassador’s long-shot bid to defeat   for the Republican nomination.

Linda Portel has watched a barrage of presidential campaign commercials this year from her living room in Urbandale, Iowa. Many have faded from her memory. But one stuck with her: an ad attacking   that Portel viewed as sexist. The 30-second spot tying Haley to Hillary Clinton is just the kind of broadside that Portel, who is undecided, and other Haley admirers worry could derail the former U.N. ambassador’s long-shot bid to defeat   for the Republican nomination. A former Trump supporter, Portel is concerned that the misleading portrayal of Haley as an acolyte of a former female candidate reviled by conservatives could hurt her in the crucial weeks ahead. “Unfortunately, people don’t read between the lines,” said Portel, 76, in an interview. As Haley has risen in the polls in recent months amid a shrinking GOP field, she has faced escalating attacks from rivals and their allies that critics regard as sexist and meant to single out her gender in a Republican Party that has been   than Democrats to elevate women into some of the most prominent elected offices. The party remains dominated by Trump, who routinely attacks women with sexist and demeaning language and was this year  . Interviews with more than 40 Republican voters, activists and officials in key early states show a party that has never nominated a woman for president navigating conflicting opinions, including some signs of voter unease at the prospect, even as Haley has grown her support and seeks to cement her position as  . Some Haley backers say they are increasingly concerned about this trend — and what they see as efforts from rival candidates and their allies to exploit it. Haley supporter Bart Weller, who attended her town hall in Ankeny, Iowa, summed up some of the challenges that Haley faces when he recalled one of his brothers bluntly telling him, “I don’t want to vote for a woman to be president.” Male rivals have gone after Haley in ways that some GOP critics say is either flatly sexist or carries sexist undertones. Trump has labeled Haley “birdbrain.” He told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt earlier this year that she was “overly ambitious” and “just couldn’t stay in her seat.” (Haley has said being called ambitious used to bother her, but now she considers it being a “badass”). Biotech entrepreneur   has suggested Haley should switch over to “the party of identity politics” and   her “gender-card shtick is pathetic & straight out of the Kamala Harris / Hillary Clinton playbook.” In addition to the ad Portel watched from the pro-Ron DeSantis group Fight Right — which highlights Haley saying Clinton in part inspired her to run for office, selectively omitting her criticism of Clinton — another group supporting the Florida governor has released misleading   splicing together similar words uttered by Haley, Clinton and Michelle Obama. Portel referenced the ad she saw in a conversation with door-knockers from a pro-Haley group, Americans for Prosperity. Haley and her allies have dismissed attacks from her male rivals, and she has delivered one-liners at debates that nod to her position as the only woman onstage. “I love all the attention, fellas,” she said during the fourth debate in Alabama, while under both policy and personal criticism from the other candidates. Others have issued more direct criticism. Barbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman who is on the board of both VIEW PAC and Winning for Women — two groups devoted to electing more conservative women to higher office — roundly denounced the criticisms from Trump and others. “Imagine him criticizing Vivek Ramaswamy for being overly ambitious, right? That’s something that is only applied to women,” said Comstock, who is supporting former New Jersey governor   in the 2024 race. She noted that Trump’s “birdbrain” nickname has been largely ignored by Haley: “That’s because she’s in a party where there’s a lot of misogyny, so it makes that much more difficult for her to take that on herself.” “In the old Republican Party, there would have been a lot of men who would have stood up and said, ‘How dare you, this is outrageous,’” Comstock added. “But Trump’s unleashed everyone’s inner misogyny — so for a lot of these guys, they can openly be that way because Trump is.” Spokespeople for the rival campaigns and their allied groups defended the ads and attacks, arguing they are pointing out how Haley’s policies and some of the positions she has taken are out of step with the base of the Republican Party and that her gender should not preclude such arguments. Tricia McLaughlin, an adviser to Ramaswamy, said she found the “cries of sexism incredibly infantilizing,” and “having two X chromosomes doesn’t shield you from scrutiny.” At the same time, many of Trump’s supporters largely shrug off his controversial comments about women and his efforts to demean his past female rivals. “The women taking offense, they need a stronger backbone,” said Sandra, a recent retiree from Mason City, Iowa, who spoke on the condition that her full name not be used to protect her privacy. Though she disliked some of Trump’s tweets, she said in an interview at a local Walmart that the former president “makes me laugh.” Women of both parties face gender discrimination running for office, but experts say historical patterns show the hurdles for female Republicans can be even more pervasive because the party base tends to skew  , and GOP voters are much less likely to say women’s political underrepresentation is a problem. A  in September found major differences between the two parties when adults were asked whether it was important to see a female president in their lifetime: 14 percent of Republicans or those who lean Republican said it was; while 57 percent of Democrats or those who lean Democrat said the same. Many Republican  female voters said they like Haley’s political pitch, including her calls for consensus and unity. But Trump is leading the GOP primary field by a huge margin, including among female voters; in a recent  , 61 percent of  primary voters backed Trump while only 9 percent backed Haley. Experts who track gender in politics say that Haley has been nimble in balancing the competing pressures that female candidates often face. They note that she has maintained her likability in focus groups while also showing voters in debates that she can be tough with slashing attacks on some of her rivals. But Haley has also faced scrutiny from some activists who argue she selectively highlights her gender or race only when politically advantageous. Many Democratic critics view her frequent assertions that Kamala Harris — the nation’s first female, Black and South Asian vice president — is not qualified to be president as sexist. In head-to-head matchups with  , Haley has often performed more strongly than Trump in part by appealing to a broader group of voters, including moderates, suburbanites, independents, as well as some of the former GOP women who say they left the party over Trump. Biden won a majority of women against Trump in 2020. The GOP recognizes that “we have a problem with female voters, and specifically younger female voters,” said Ariel Hill-Davis, the founder and policy director of Republican Women for Progress. “You have this really tough situation for women and candidates like Nikki Haley — where in order to make it through a primary you can’t lean into your identity,” Hill-Davis added, even though “those are actually the exact sorts of things in a general [election] that would be helpful to your campaign.” Some Democrats say they are relieved that due in part to sexist attitudes in some segments of the GOP, they believe Haley — who has shown potential to appeal across party lines in a general election — is unlikely to be the Republican nominee. “They won’t nominate her, thank God,” said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. “What a poison sexism is.” Female politicians from both parties have long struggled to strike the balance between toughness and femininity that voters will accept, some who have run for office said. “Talking about gender is a no-win path for a female politician. If you say there are real problems that women face, then you’re a whiner. You say everything is wonderful and there are no problems at all, half the population wonders what planet you’re on,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who mounted her own presidential bid in 2020, told The Washington Post. While Clinton galvanized female voters in 2016 with the goal of breaking the “highest, hardest glass ceiling,” Haley has been more subtle with her nods at her gender, emphatically stating she rejects identity-based politics. She has sported T-shirts in Iowa with pointed messages like “Underestimate me, that’ll be fun”; described her heels as ammunition; blasted Sheryl Crow’s “Woman in the White House,” at campaign events; and on the debate stage adopted a mantra of her personal hero Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s first female prime minister: “If you want something done, ask a woman.” On the trail, Haley has highlighted her role as a mom while discussing both abortion and the participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports — two areas where supporters regularly give her high marks. Haley has  on abortion and said the federal government should be involved, but she has largely avoided specifics, arguing that a federal ban is unlikely to pass Congress. She instead has personalized the issue, talking about her own struggles to have children, her husband who was adopted and a friend who was raped. She has maintained throughout her career that she doesn’t want to be defined as just a woman or just a woman of color — even as she has broken barriers as the country’s first female Asian American governor, the first Indian American to serve in the Cabinet, and one of the first two women of color to be elected governor of a state. “I had never asked to be elected because I was a woman or because I was Indian. For one thing, for those who cared about such things, my race and my sex were at least as much a negative as they were a positive. And for another when you do that, you’re playing the game,” Haley wrote in her memoir “Can’t Is Not an Option.” South Carolina state Rep. Nathan Ballentine (R), one of Haley’s closest allies during her time as a  from 2004 to 2010, said he pushed Haley to play the “chick card” earlier in her career when she ran for governor and that she refused, saying the election was about policy. In her book, “Can’t Is Not an Option,” Haley recalls being the first and only female executive at a recycling company, where another executive asked her to grab the CEO coffee at one of her first meetings. She called her assistant to get the coffee instead and said after that moment her colleagues treated her as an equal. When she ran for office she was discounted as inexperienced and was thought to have no chance in part because a woman hadn’t served as governor before. Once elected, she writes about being careful not to lose control of her emotions as a woman. Amanda Hunter, the executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, a nonpartisan organization focused on researching women running for executive office, described Haley as “one of the most adept women leaders that we’ve seen in recent history at navigating the tightrope that women have to walk.” Hunter said that Haley’s campaign has effectively woven her gender and race into her message without making it the core of her appeal, and they have also given voters permission to say those attributes don’t matter. But political strategists stressed that Haley has many obstacles ahead — predicting that the gendered and sexist attacks on her will intensify further as she attempts to become the first woman to make it to the White House. Frank Sadler, who managed Republican Carly Fiorina’s presidential campaign in 2016, said that female candidates must overcome subconscious expectations from voters that candidates should look the part of what they imagine a president to look like. That’s a challenge, he said, when there have only been male presidents. Some voters such as Cheryl Wensel, who attended a Trump Commit to Caucus event in Coralville, Iowa, earlier this month, noted a similar point and said she doesn’t think Republicans would elect a female president: “It would be different, it would be strange.” But Haley has also appealed to many Republican women, drawing growing crowds in key early states. In interviews with more than 30 in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, many noted that they identify with Haley’s experiences, even as they underscore that they don’t believe in identity politics. “I like that she’s female — but that isn’t the only reason. I think that she’s just a very strong, politically savvy candidate. And I like that she speaks her mind as well,” said Iowa voter June Locke, who attended a Haley town hall in Cedar Rapids. “It’s about time. We know that we’re the stronger sex.” Her pitch has also appealed to independent women like Charlie Pogue, who said at a Haley town hall in Hooksett, N.H., that she’d “vote for Satan over Trump.” While she supported Democratic business executive Andrew Yang in 2020, she now likes “pretty much everything” that Haley says. Many of the women said they believe Haley is a unifier and could bring the country together more effectively than a male president. They praised what they see as her emphasis on consensus rather than name-calling, and how she talks about being a mom. For some who are volunteering for her campaign, the idea of electing the first female president is a strong motivator. At a Haley event in Boiling Springs, S.C., Spartanburg resident Jen Pappas said: “The gender does not impress me, but because I am a female, I agree with a lot of things … I think she’s more understanding. Men seem to be more [for] themselves, while she seems more to be for others.” Former New Hampshire speaker pro tempore Kimberly Rice, a co-chair of Haley’s campaign in the state, said she never considered supporting Haley because of her gender but that she thinks she is the ideal role model for her four daughters and granddaughter “because she is not only strong and fierce, she is also compassionate and caring, in a way that I think that a female leader should be.” Yet admirers like Chris Hurayt, a 64-year-old retiree in Boiling Springs, sympathize with Haley’s challenges ahead. “She’s the only woman out there against all these other guys, and it’s always been a man’s world.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/26/nikki-haley-sexism-republican-politics/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 09:11:00,

Of the seven City Edition uniforms the Washington Wizards have unveiled since the NBA and Nike launched their leaguewide initiative in 2017 to celebrate each franchise’s unique ties to its community (and sell more merchandise), this year’s version is the most outside the box. Washington’s black, gray, copper and teal uniforms were officially revealed Wednesday after leaking last week on social media, on which they prompted   from befuddled fans about what, if anything, the look had to do with D.C. Most of the team’s   incorporated the franchise’s traditional red, white and blue color scheme; last year’s  , a rare exception, featured an obvious connection to the District. Whether it sways fan opinion remains to be seen, but the story behind the Wizards’ newest uniforms is genuinely fascinating. The design was inspired not by Medieval Times or “The Legend of Zelda,” as some jokingly suggested, but by the oldest monuments purchased by the U.S. government —  , placed at one-mile intervals, that marked the original boundary of the District of Columbia after the Residence Act of 1790 authorized President George Washington to establish an up to 100-square-mile site for the nation’s new capital along the Potomac River. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson   to survey the land, and after mathematician and astronomer Benjamin Banneker helped locate the point where the survey should start in February 1791, Ellicott and his brother roughly marked the District’s 40-mile,   over the next month. The first boundary stone was laid at Jones Point in Alexandria on April 15, 1791. The project, which involved a logging party clearing a 40-foot swath of land across the boundary line carved out of Maryland and Virginia, was completed Jan. 1, 1793. Today, 36 stones, including four replacements, can be found in their original locations in D.C., Maryland and Virginia. Some are  , while others go virtually unnoticed alongside busy streets or get mistaken for gravestones in  . “I live a block away from one of the stones and I’m a history nerd, so I brought it up and we ideated on it,” Hunter Lochmann, Monumental Sports and Entertainment’s chief marketing officer, said of how the idea for this season’s City Edition uniforms originated more than two years ago. (Lochmann and his team are already planning the Wizards’ City Edition uniforms for 2025-26.) Before pitching the idea to Nike, Lochmann sought input from one of the world’s leading experts on the stones, Stephen Powers, who happens to be a die-hard Wizards fan and longtime season ticket holder. Powers, a 59-year-old civil engineer and amateur historian, grew up in Northern Virginia and fell in love with the Washington Bullets during the 1970s. He developed an interest in the boundary stones much later, when his daughter was tasked with coming up with a trivia question about her native Arlington for a second-grade class project. Powers offered that Arlington was part of D.C. until Congress retroceded the land on the Virginia side of the Potomac to the commonwealth in 1846. After taking his daughter to a couple of the boundary stones still standing in Arlington, Powers became determined to find them all. With some help from the Nation’s Capital Boundary Stone Committee, for which he now serves as chairman, Powers and a friend visited every remaining stone May 7, 2006. They  . “We had so much fun, we did it again and again,” said Powers, who has   on the first Sunday in May for 18 consecutive years. Lochmann tagged along for the start of this year’s trip. Nike loved the boundary stone idea; after all, the historic markers literally defined the District and were now part of the fabric of D.C., Maryland and Virginia. Powers, whom Lochmann called a “wonderful resource” throughout the design process, offered feedback on several boundary stone-themed prototypes created by Nike’s designers. The chosen design reflects the boundary stones’ colorful history. The diagonal red piping across the jersey and shorts creates a gray diamond that represents the original shape of the District. The copper and teal patina around the trim was inspired by the oxidized metal of the fences the Daughters of the American Revolution installed to protect the boundary stones in 1915. Beginning around 2011, Powers helped organize   to restore 22 of the fences over the next several years. The six red stars along the side of the uniform are a nod to the legend of how Banneker determined the location for the placement of the southern corner stone in 1791, by plotting the movement of six stars across a spot in the sky at a specific time of night. Six teal compasses above the NBA tag on the jersey symbolize the survey instruments used. The uniform features a modified version of the Wizards’ primary logo, with a boundary stone replacing the Washington Monument. “The District of Columbia” appears in blackletter, or Gothic script, on the front of the jerseys, representing the type of font found on maps around the time the boundary stones were installed. “DMV” is featured in the same typeface on the waistband of the shorts. The boundary stones were made out of   from Stafford County, the same material used in the construction of the Capitol and White House. Lochmann said a light gray or beige color more similar to the color of the stones was considered, but the NBA nixed the idea out of concern for how the jerseys would look on traditional hardwood courts, especially on TV broadcasts. Powers is pleased with the uniforms and suggested the leaked images didn’t do them justice, in part because the diamond shape that’s such a key part of the design is only apparent when the jersey and shorts are paired together. “I’m hoping the tide is going to turn when people see it presented holistically and get the backstory on it, that there will be more pride and understanding,” Powers said. “And hopefully, for me, people are like, ‘Oh, I want to go see these stones.’ Maybe this will get us closer to one day the stones being National Historic Landmarks and getting money to take care of them.” (Only one stone,   Benjamin Banneker Park, has a National Historic Landmark designation and the   that come with it.) Shedding some light on the oldest monuments defining The District's origins. We’ll be bringing Boundary Stones to life through our 2023-24 City Edition Uniforms.   |    Lochmann acknowledged that the popularity of last year’s cherry blossom design will be hard to top, but the team is proud to bring awareness to a seldom-told part of D.C. history. “At the end of the day, we can’t make everyone love it, but what’s neat about the City Edition jerseys is it’s a way to educate your city about what makes it special,” Lochmann said. “Very few people who grew up here have heard of [the stones]. … This one is a stretch, it’s out there, but we’re excited to educate our fan base.” “It’s kind of a dream come true,” Powers said of being able to combine two of his passions. “It’s surreal to see it happen. I think the stones are going to get a little more national attention because of this, and that to me is the best part.” The Wizards will wear their City Edition uniforms for the first time Nov. 10 against the Charlotte Hornets, which is Washington’s first home game of the NBA’s inaugural in-season tournament. The team will debut a boundary stone-themed court — different from the custom court   — on Dec. 15. Wizards City Edition uniforms and other merchandise will be available at the Capital One Arena team store and online beginning Thursday.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/01/wizards-city-edition-uniforms/,Washington Post,2023-11-01 10:14:00,

Kirill Kaprizov extended his goal-scoring streak to four games, Marcus Johansson scored twice, and Matt Boldy added a goal for Minnesota, which has won four in a row and seven of eight. The Wild are 11-3-0 since John Hynes took over behind the bench — including seven straight home wins — after an uninspiring 4-1 loss in Detroit Nov. 26 extended a losing streak to seven games and resulted in the firing of Dean Evason. “We’ve regrouped. It shows a lot of character in our group and how we were able to be resilient,” Hartman said. Filip Gustavsson made 25 saves and improved to 8-2 in his last 10 starts. “We can do a lot. We’re trending in the right direction. And it’s fun hockey to play right now,” Johansson said. Patrick Kane scored for the fourth straight game and Alex DeBrincat and Daniel Sprong added goals as the Red Wings lost for the sixth time in seven games. Detroit is 2-8-1 in its last 11 games. James Reimer finished with 25 saves; he has allowed 24 goals in his last five starts. Detroit coach Derek Lalonde did not put this loss on his netminder. “The difference in the third is the puck ended in the back of the net off of turnovers, where it did not in the second,” he said. “This is sloppy DNA stuff; this was not us over the first 25 games. … Now just blue-line turnovers, high-zone turnovers. It’s disappointing and it’s gonna come out of our game.” DeBrincat scored a one-timer of a feed from Shayne Gostisbehere for a power-play goal early in the third period, tying the game at 2. Less than two minutes later, Pat Maroon carried the puck down the left side and passed to a trailing Hartman, who converted the feed in the slot for his third goal in three games. Hartman had missed the last two games with an upper-body injury. Less than a minute later, Foligno scored while falling, tucking a rebound behind Reimer. Johansson scored his second of the game 75 seconds later to give the Wild a 5-2 lead. “Nice to see, and nice to see that we can break away from a team like that,” Foligno said. A goal by Sprong got Detroit within 5-3, but Kaprizov scored on a redirect with 5:45 remaining. Kaprizov, the NHL’s first star for the week ending Dec. 24, has a five-game point streak, with five goals and four assists. Boldy converted a feed from Kaprizov 38 seconds into the game for a 1-0 lead. Kane countered six minutes later, whistling a wrist shot from the left dot past Gustavsson for his fifth goal in four games, extending his points streak to five games. Kane last scored in four straight games during a six-game stretch from Nov. 7-17, 2019, with Chicago. Johansson scored off a rebound in the slot early in the second period for a 2-1 Minnesota lead. “Too many turnovers, giving them too many easy chances off the rush. A lot of guys in this league can make a lot of plays, and when you give them easy offense, they get momentum off that, so obviously that was the case tonight,” Kane said.

"WNBA star and ESPN basketball analyst Chiney Ogwumike will be dipping her sneakers into the realm of international politics.  announced Tuesday that Ogwumike will join a new presidential advisory council aimed at “promoting trade, investment and educational exchanges” between the United States and African nations. The President’s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United States will also seek to “reinforce cultural, social, political and economic ties” between the United States and Africa by “enhancing dialogue” between political leaders and members of the African Diaspora, according to a White House statement. WNBA star and ESPN basketball analyst Chiney Ogwumike will be dipping her sneakers into the realm of international politics.  announced Tuesday that Ogwumike will join a new presidential advisory council aimed at “promoting trade, investment and educational exchanges” between the United States and African nations. The President’s Advisory Council on African Diaspora Engagement in the United States will also seek to “reinforce cultural, social, political and economic ties” between the United States and Africa by “enhancing dialogue” between political leaders and members of the African Diaspora, according to a White House statement. Ogwumike, the 31-year-old daughter of Nigerian immigrants, was the only athlete named to the 12-person council. “To have the opportunity to serve in a diplomatic capacity, knowing that representation matters and to be able to honor both of my cultures,” Ogwumike said in a telephone interview, “this feels like the calling of a lifetime for me.” The council, first announced by Vice President Harris at the 2022 U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, will be chaired by Rev. Silvester Beaman of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Other council members, who will serve until 2025, include Viola Davis, the Oscar-winning actress, and Patrick Gaspard, the president of the Center for American Progress. “Chiney is a leader on and off the court who inspires the next generation both at home and around the world,” said a senior White House official who was not authorized to discuss the selections publicly. “With numerous trips to the African continent, Chiney represents the best of America and has shown a remarkable commitment to youth engagement.” Raised in Texas, Ogwumike was a McDonald’s all-American at Cy-Fair High outside Houston before playing four years at Stanford. Upon graduating as the Pac-12’s all-time leading scorer, she was selected with the top pick in the 2014 WNBA draft. In recent years, the two-time WNBA all-star has  , providing NBA commentary for ESPN. She averaged 8.4 points and 4.3 rebounds for the Los Angeles Sparks this season. By joining the advisory council, Ogwumike hopes to further her public advocacy for African women, which began when she and her sister, WNBA star Nneka Ogwumike, launched a   in 2014 following the kidnapping of Nigerian girls by Boko Haram, an Islamist extremist group. “There’s a colloquial Nigerian phrase: ‘Naija No Dey Carry Last.’ We’re not going to be last,” Chiney Ogwumike said. “We’re always aiming to be first, to win and to strive to be successful. Our parents preach that. The joke is that the Nigerian household expectation is that you’re a doctor, lawyer or engineer. But there are barriers to entry for African youth. “My experience growing up in Houston allowed me to try basketball at age 10, and that transformed my whole life. The infrastructure for young girls back home, even for my cousins, is not the same. There’s a dichotomy of experience. Africa is full of beautiful, rich and proud traditions, but oftentimes there are patriarchal cultures where women and young girls are expected to fit a mold.” While at Stanford, Ogwumike specialized in comparative international governance and African studies, studied abroad in Nigeria and was mentored by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Those educational experiences encouraged her interest in making regular return trips to her parents’ home country, including a 2020 speaking appearance at Queen’s College, a Lagos boarding school for girls that her mother attended. Ogwumike’s dual life as a player and broadcaster has brought her to Kenya, Rwanda and South Africa; she has attended   camps and served as a sideline reporter for the inaugural NBA Africa game in 2017. In hopes of garnering greater economic support for African youth, she has served as a board member for  , an international sports development organization, and participated in a United Nations General Assembly forum with  , an African youth empowerment organization co-founded by Toronto Raptors President Masai Ujiri. “People know my passion to go home‚” Ogwumike said. “The first time you come, everyone does a basketball clinic and then leaves. The second time you come, everyone says, ‘Okay, that’s nice.’ But the third time you come, and I try to make it a point to go back home to Nigeria every year, people were like, ‘Oh, she’s a real one.’ That’s where I get so much happiness and pride.” As Ogwumike balances her work at ESPN and her new role on the advisory council, her basketball future remains uncertain. The Sparks missed the playoffs with a 17-23 record, and Ogwumike enters the offseason as a free agent. “There are three pillars to who I am: athlete, analyst and advocate,” she said. “I always go into the offseason with an open mind. This is an important time in my life. What’s best for me to continue to grow as a person, player and broadcaster? There’s no full commitments anywhere, but I stay ready so I don’t have to get ready. I’m always training.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/09/26/chiney-ogwumike-presidents-advisory-council/,Washington Post,2023-09-26 12:00:00,
"LAS VEGAS — From its inception,   was a giant neon target for skeptics.

The tournament would be free-standing, and its results wouldn’t impact the playoffs or draft. “Buy-in” quickly emerged as the catchphrase of choice for dubious observers: Would the players, owners, general managers and fans even care?

After years of tedious public brainstorms and trial balloons, the event was finally announced this past summer complete with a clunky name, a confusing group stage format,  , a “Final 4” weekend in Sin City,   and millions of dollars in prize money for the players. The tournament would be free-standing, and its results wouldn’t impact the playoffs or draft. “Buy-in” quickly emerged as the catchphrase of choice for dubious observers: Would the players, owners, general managers and fans even care? If traditional hardwood fell in the forest and was painted red and blue in the Nevada desert, would it make a sound? By the time   at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday to hoist the first NBA Cup, the “buy-in” question had faded amid a chorus of plaudits from notable players and   who appreciated the intense gameplay and largely came to embrace the novel concept. Even so, the tournament was far from a perfect debut, and future iterations will require some deep thinking and soul searching. “I know [the new tournament] doesn’t come without challenges,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged Saturday. “There’s no doubt there’s some things that we are learning this time through. Overall, we are thrilled with the interest we’ve seen so far this season. People are tired of hearing the word ‘tweak,’ so we’ll come up with another synonym for that. … My sense is there’s no question there will be some changes for next year.” James’s Lakers went 7-0 in the tournament, surviving   in the quarterfinals before wiping Zion Williamson’s New Orleans Pelicans off the court in the semifinals. Meanwhile,   past the Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks en route to the final, treating a euphoric Gainbridge Fieldhouse crowd to a thrilling show in the quarterfinals. Many of the league’s most important players showed that they cared: James cranked up his play to Finals-level intensity to win tournament MVP honors; Durant put up a good fight in the quarterfinals; Giannis Antetokounmpo poured in 37 points in a losing effort in the semifinals; Stephen Curry came up just short in a thrilling group stage finale against the Sacramento Kings; and Haliburton took full advantage of the made-for-television stage by breaking through as a possible future face of the league. “I wasn’t a huge fan of the in-season tournament when they announced it and were coming up with the idea,” Durant said last week. “But today, leading up to the [quarterfinal] game, it felt like a playoff game from friends, family and fans so excited about it. The courts were different. I wasn’t a huge fan, but now I’m excited about the in-season tournament and [angry] we’re not going to Vegas to try to win this thing.” The novelty surrounding the first tournament helped ensure that this year’s early-season games have been more competitive than those in 2022-23, and the NBA has been quick to trumpet its increased television ratings, social media views and attendance figures. Final four weekend doubled as an extended victory lap; James repeatedly hailed Silver as a “genius,” and the commissioner somehow found himself opining on Henry Kissinger’s legacy with ESPN’s Pat McAfee during a mini media blitz. Unfortunately, every basketball tournament from primary school to the   is only as good as its atmosphere, and the Las Vegas games left a lot to be desired. Shifting to a neutral site in a player-friendly market that has hosted Summer League games for years was a logical move, but timing and logistics created a flat atmosphere for Thursday’s semifinals and a one-sided Lakers pep really for the final. T-Mobile Arena was not as loud or as engaged as it was during the NCAA West Region games in March: Besides the Lakers, who have long been Las Vegas favorites because of their proximity, there were relatively few fans of the qualifying teams in the building and hardly any interactions between rival contingents. With the semifinalists not clinching their spots until Monday or Tuesday, their respective beat writers were left scrambling to make last-minute travel accommodations. This tight turnaround left fans of the Bucks, Pacers and Pelicans to weigh whether they wanted to spend thousands of dollars on airfare, hotels and tickets and take multiple days off during the workweek to attend in person. By all appearances, they opted out. There were thousands of empty seats during Thursday’s first semifinal, though special court lighting helped conceal that fact on the television broadcast. As the Pacers and Bucks dueled in the fourth quarter, there was a dramatic drop-off in excitement compared with the quarterfinals, which were held in home markets. Any Pelicans fans who made the trip were treated to a complete no-show from Williamson and Brandon Ingram. With the Lakers advancing, Saturday’s final played to a full house that sounded like a first-round playoff game at best. The championship celebration, in turn, was joyous but lukewarm. Increased ticket prices might have kept away some of the die-hard basketball fans who live in the Las Vegas area, and the 2 p.m. Pacific time start for Thursday’s first semifinal was simply inconvenient. Silver explained the NBA built its tournament schedule working backward from ABC’s desirable Saturday evening time slot for the final, but creating an electric scene that generates fear of missing out and positive word of mouth should have been the top priority for a new tournament facing credibility questions. The NBA learned how crucial its crowds were when it held the 2020 playoffs in empty arenas within the pandemic bubble near Orlando, yet it prioritized ratings over ambiance and should be very, very grateful that James and the Lakers were able to cover up potential shortcomings at the gate. While the league took savvy steps by lining up celebrities, well-known musicians and basketball legends to juice the festivities, it should build in more time — perhaps an extra week — between the quarterfinals and semifinals so that fans can pull their trips together. The NBA should consider incentivizing season ticket holders to travel to the event with priority access to discounted or free tickets, sacrificing some gate revenue in favor of genuine noise and passion. As for the game dates, the NCAA Final Four’s Saturday/Monday is more intuitive than the NBA’s Thursday/Saturday pairing. Silver should pitch ABC on airing the semifinals as a doubleheader Saturday and then push the final to Tuesday on TNT, if necessary, to avoid a conflict with “Monday Night Football.” The NBA also must rethink Las Vegas as the host, even as it endlessly teases the possibility of adding an expansion franchise there one day. There are dozens of better “basketball cities” across the country that would turn out for a tentpole NBA event and many venues that are superior to the passable T-Mobile Arena. The risk of one team getting an unfair home court advantage shouldn’t deter the NBA from holding the tournament in Miami, at a landmark arena such as Madison Square Garden or in a pristine new building such as the Intuit Dome that’s nearly complete in Inglewood, Calif. After all, this year’s version might as well have been called the “Lakers Invitational.” Silver mentioned some common complaints — annoyance over the group stage’s new point differential rules and backlash to bright red courts — that should fade as coaches and players get more familiar with the event and the league refines its aesthetic decisions. Yet the issue of stakes should nag at the league’s brain trust. The 38-year-old James drew laughs Thursday when he explained he took three charges against the Pelicans because he wanted the $500,000-per-player bonus for the winning team. Moments later, though, Lakers guard D’Angelo Russell said he planned to use his prize money to finance upcoming vacations. Good for Russell and great for his lesser-paid teammates who can really use the money, but such a nakedly capitalistic exercise will never penetrate the public’s heart. The tournament needs a better tangible reward — whether that’s an automatic play-in tournament spot, an elevated draft pick or something else — to ensure continued buy-in from players and to convince fans to invest more deeply. In short: The in-season tournament needs a simpler and unhyphenated name, fewer red courts, a more thoughtful schedule and an open relationship with Las Vegas. The dazzling NBA Cup trophy can stay, and it’s safe to assume the tournament’s mystique will build naturally over time. Most of all, the league must improve the quality of its steak rather than relying on marketing sizzle. “If you’re a baller, your thing is balling,” Hall of Famer Julius Erving said Thursday. “Not fashion, not the design of the court and not all that kind of stuff. Those are other people’s concerns. Your deal is balling and balling well. Don’t be a bum when you step out there.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/11/nba-cup-tournament-analysis/,Washington Post,2023-12-11 06:45:00,

Teams that looked strong during the regular season may now be missing a whole lot of production, and others may be playing under coaches that are there only on an interim basis. We’re here to help sift through the comings and goings to give you a few plays during the college football postseason. My picks during the regular season  , and hopefully I can keep that going as we inch toward the College Football Playoff. Point spreads and totals taken Wednesday from DraftKings Sportsbook. All times Eastern Ohio would have been a fairly easy pick over a Georgia Southern team that lost four straight to end the season, but the Bobcats have been decimated by transfers, particularly on offense: Starting quarterback Kurtis Rourke, wide receivers Miles Cross (team-high 617 receiving yards) and Tyler Walton (37 receptions), and running backs Sieh Bangura and O’Shaan Allison (1,263 rushing yards, 10 touchdowns combined) all have left. But apart from first-team all-Mid-American Conference linebacker Keye Thompson, who also transferred, Ohio’s defense remains untouched and matches up well with a Georgia Southern offense that passes the ball   (fourth in the country). The Bobcats allow only   (tied for ninth nationally) and rank   in expected points allowed per pass play and 15th in defensive passing success rate.  under 48.5 Miami probably will be down to third-string quarterback Henry Hesson (five career pass attempts, none of them this season) after Brett Gabbert suffered a season-ending injury in October and replacement Aveon Smith transferred after helping lead the RedHawks to the MAC title. Appalachian State also will be down a few skill-position players, with wide receiver Dashaun Davis (No. 3 on the team in receptions, No. 4 in receiving yards) and running back Nate Noel (team-high 834 rushing yards) transferring. Miami operates at one of the slowest paces in the nation (30.8 seconds per play, No. 130 out of 133 Football Bowl Subdivision teams) and now has to break in an extremely green quarterback. Plus, there could be weather issues in Orlando ( ). It all adds up to the under.  under 44.5 Fresno State started the season 8-1 and was ranked 25th in the coaches’ poll, but things went completely south as the Bulldogs lost their final three games, two of them to teams (New Mexico and San Diego State) that tied for last place in the Mountain West. Fresno State’s rushing defense completely evaporated, allowing 6.1 yards per carry over the final three games after allowing just 3.5 in its first nine, and the offense averaged only 17.7 points per game after averaging 34 in its first nine. Coach Jeff Tedford will not coach in the bowl game because of health reasons, and there’s a sense the Bulldogs would just like this season to end. New Mexico State, on the other hand, has had a resoundingly successful season for a program that’s usually among the nation’s worst, winning 10 games for the first time in 63 years. Led by Conference USA offensive player of the year Diego Pavia, who will play despite a shoulder injury the quarterback suffered in a conference championship game loss to Liberty, the Aggies average 5.8 yards per carry, ranking fourth nationally, and come in at  . Now they get to play only about three hours north of campus and are expecting  , essentially making this a home game.

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Five time zones and an ocean away in the cold of London, where her priorities remain until May, Emma Hayes planned to watch a live feed of her future disciples on the U.S. women’s national soccer team play in steamy South Florida on Saturday. It was their first match since Hayes, the longtime Chelsea coach,   of the sport’s most decorated women’s program. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Five time zones and an ocean away in the cold of London, where her priorities remain until May, Emma Hayes planned to watch a live feed of her future disciples on the U.S. women’s national soccer team play in steamy South Florida on Saturday. It was their first match since Hayes, the longtime Chelsea coach,   of the sport’s most decorated women’s program. Much of what she saw in a 3-0 victory over China probably pleased her, though   leading up to the Paris   next summer. Washington Spirit star Trinity Rodman, among the key figures in U.S. efforts to rebound from last summer’s World Cup disappointment, posted a goal and two assists — then met one of her idols, retired tennis star Serena Williams. Sophia Smith and Lindsey Horan also scored as the United States extended its unbeaten streak since the World Cup to five games (with no goals conceded). “I hope she’s sleeping at this moment,” interim coach Twila Kilgore said of Hayes. “One hundred percent, she was watching. She was definitely watching live. I will look forward to talking to her when she’s ready and has time to do that and kind of get her viewpoint, and we’ll go from there.” Until she steps into her new role, Hayes will monitor the transitioning program from afar, collaborating with Kilgore on rosters, lineups and tactics. Hayes met with Kilgore and the players during training camp earlier in the week before returning home Thursday. Although there were not glaring changes to the approach Kilgore used in September and October camps, the players said they noticed greater energy and direction — and greater freedom to express themselves on the field. “Being able to meet Emma was the start of the foundation,” Rodman said. “I definitely feel like we’re starting to create that new identity. ... I don’t know if ‘relief’ is the word, but security of knowing who’s coaching us was a weight lifted off all of our shoulders.” Horan, the captain, said the team is making progress. “There were places and opportunities we could have been better. We could have capitalized more,” she said. “But it has been really nice having Emma for a few days, bringing that energy and presence.” Midfielders Jenna Nighswonger and Olivia Moultrie made their debuts, and center back Abby Dahlkemper returned from a 20-month absence following back surgery. In the second half, the lineup included Moultrie, 18; Rodman, 21; Jaedyn Shaw, 19; and Mia Fishel, 22. “It’s so fun to see people out there I have played [with] together for a long time,” Moultrie said. “The things we would talk about at [under-20 camp], ‘Oh, I hope we’re on the full team together someday.’ That’s super cool, just seeing the turnover and what’s coming.” Added Fishel: “I think we all felt that connection and how we want to play in the future.” The United States went ahead in the eighth minute following sustained possession. Naomi Girma’s long ball out of midfield liberated Rodman gaining separation on the left flank. In stride, Rodman sent a bending cross into the six-yard box, where a sliding Smith beat goalkeeper Xu Huan to the ball. Typically a wing on the national team, Smith started at center forward. The team’s longtime starter, Alex Morgan, was not selected to this roster amid a dip in her international form. Several other veterans also were passed over. Smith, the NWSL’s top scorer this season, enjoyed three additional chances before halftime. “We had some really, really good moments,” Kilgore said, “but we just need to be more clinical in our finishing.” Changes came in the second half. Fishel and Shaw displayed chemistry in the attack. Rose Lavelle, who started on the right side, shifted centrally.

"Jacques Delors, a French elder statesman who spent a decade as president of the European Commission — the European Union’s executive branch — and became a driving force behind the continent’s economic integration and a leading proponent of a common market and currency, has died at 98. The death was first announced by Agence France-Presse, citing his daughter. The office of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, later issued a statement on the death.

Jacques Delors, a French elder statesman who spent a decade as president of the European Commission — the European Union’s executive branch — and became a driving force behind the continent’s economic integration and a leading proponent of a common market and currency, has died at 98. The death was first announced by Agence France-Presse, citing his daughter. The office of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, later issued a statement on the death. No other details were immediately made public. A socialist and trade unionist who began his career at France’s central bank, Mr. Delors worked as an economics lecturer and as a senior official in ideologically divergent French governments. Under President François Mitterrand, Mr. Delors served as economics and finance minister from 1981 to 1983 and as economics, finance and budget minister in 1983 and 1984. He was considered a moderate in the country’s first socialist government since 1956. In the face of growing inflation, he pushed for what some socialists called “austerity with a human face,” putting the brakes on spending and introducing new taxes. In 1985, when European unity still appeared tenuous, Mr. Delors was appointed president of the Brussels-based European Commission with Mitterrand’s strong backing. Over the next 10 years, Mr. Delors came to exert more influence over the continent’s future than any president before or since. He fought for the European single market, launched in 1993, and the single currency, the euro, authorized by the Maastricht Treaty that year and rolled out beginning in 1999. “Those two things are his great achievements,” said Stephen Wall, a diplomat and historian who became Britain’s permanent representative to the European Union in 1995. “I don’t think they would have happened without his brain and his drive.” The Maastricht Treaty created the European Union from the European Community that preceded it. Mr. Delors’s tenure also saw the signing of the Schengen agreement, which eliminated most border checks across much of the bloc. He was a key combatant in conflicts that remain unresolved in the era of   — Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union — on the division of power between the E.U. and national governments. Having come to see Europe as “helpless, disabled and divided,” as he   Time magazine in 2007, Mr. Delors worked hard to win converts to his vision of integration, arguing that European countries must act together economically or plunge into decline. Another key aspect of his message — that European countries should weave a shared safety net of social policies — proved a harder sell, especially later in his tenure. Mr. Delors was shaped by the pacifism of his father, who fought in the trenches of World War I, and by the massive dislocation of his own generation during World War II. Personally unassuming, he had the expansive political imagination of a radical. But he was a fervent advocate of prosperous stability and political centrism. He had “an almost inhuman capacity for work,” and “a prodigious capacity to generate ideas with a pragmatic instinct for getting them implemented,”  , former Brussels correspondent for the Economist, wrote in the 1994 biography, “Delors: Inside the House That Jacques Built.” As European Commission president, Mr. Delors pushed single-mindedly for a Europe in which people, goods and capital could flow across borders — and for the changes that countries would need to make to prepare for the new reality. He managed to sell the idea to the French leftists who sent him to Brussels and to stalwart conservatives such as British Prime Minister  , whose later clashes with him would prefigure the politics of Brexit. Thatcher and Mr. Delors, improbable partners, worked together at first to build the single market. But Thatcher wanted to stop at what Mr. Delors saw as merely a first step toward a united continent with a single currency and liberal social policies, including bloc-wide workplace standards, job training programs and a guaranteed right to collective bargaining. “Delors is like a sports car that went from 0 to 60 in seconds as far as she was concerned,” Wall said of Thatcher. The “nail in the coffin” of their relationship was a 1988 visit to Britain during which Mr. Delors, without first consulting her, delivered a speech in support of collective labor bargaining at the European level. “He didn’t take soundings,” Wall said. “She overreacted.” Her rejoinder was a resounding speech in Bruges, Belgium, in which she inveighed against a federal Europe. “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels,”  . In the 1990s, even as Mr. Delors faced increasing resistance from opponents of accelerated integration, support was coalescing around his potential run for president of France. However, he decided, he said, to forgo the bid, in part because he did not want to hold office without a mandate powerful enough to institute a sweeping overhaul of society. His legacy rested chiefly on his accomplishments at the European Union, which had 12 members in 1995 and has since more than doubled in size, with many former Eastern Bloc nations among the newer members. “I had not imagined we would be 27 members,” he told Time in 2007. “But I didn’t know the Berlin Wall would fall.” Issues he argued, and battles he began, still loom over European affairs. In 2020, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson — who made his name at the Daily Telegraph writing alarmist articles with headlines such as “Delors plans to rule Europe” — presided over   from the European Union. It was the largest challenge yet to Mr. Delors’s vision. Jacques Lucien Jean Delors was born in Paris on July 20, 1925. His father, a union activist wounded in World War I, worked as an usher and messenger at France’s central bank, where he would urge Mr. Delors to seek a career. He did not attend the exclusive schools that traditionally funnel students into the French political elite. Seeing classmates stifled by a lack of opportunity distressed him and informed his politics for life. “I think my first sense of social injustice came when I saw my pals quitting school and going straight to the factories,” he told Newsweek. He attended the University of Paris but soon went to work as an intern at the central bank, where he received rapid promotions. He continued to take night classes and received an economics degree. Mr. Delors, a practicing Roman Catholic, rarely emphasized his faith, but he had religious convictions that underpinned his politics. In 1950, he became an economic adviser to a progressive Christian trade union association and went on to organize in the Christian workers movement. In 1948, Mr. Delors married Marie Lephaille, a fellow central bank employee. She   in 2020. Their son, Jean-Paul Delors, a journalist, died of leukemia at 29, in 1982. Survivors include a daughter, Martine Aubry, the former head of France’s Socialist Party, who has been mayor of Lille, a city near France’s border with Belgium, since 2001. Early in his career, Mr. Delors began rising through the ranks of France’s policy bureaucracy, and in 1969 he was named a top adviser to Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas. In 1974, he joined the Socialist Party. In 1979, he was elected to the European Parliament. He joined Mitterrand’s government in 1981 and, while holding a cabinet seat, was the elected mayor of Clichy, a Paris suburb, from 1983 to 1984. At various times, Mr. Delors taught economics at the University of Paris-Dauphine and the prestigious L’Ecole Nationale d’Administration while working in government. After leaving politics in 1995, Mr. Delors ran the Jacques Delors Institute, a think tank in France. Mr. Delors lived to see a Europe that would have been nearly impossible to imagine when he was born, less than a decade after the end of World War I. But the forces of history that he marshaled to the cause of the European experiment remain in motion, their direction uncertain. “The construction of Europe corresponds both to an ideal and to a necessity,” he wrote in 1992, in a passage quoted by Grant in the biography. “The ideal often appeared to dim [but] the necessity has always been present, even insistent for those who did not accept the historical decline of Europe.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/12/27/jacques-delors-european-union-dies/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 12:43:00,

Jones, a seventh-round pick, batted down a pass at the line of scrimmage and Henry, a fifth-round pick playing his first defensive snaps, registered a sack that was overturned by one of the most ridiculous penalties you’ll ever see. Speaking of … There are missed calls and questionable penalties every week, but Sunday’s officiating was, at times, outrageous. The flag that had Commanders players and fans around the league talking was a roughing-the-passer penalty on Henry for, well, what exactly? Are we still playing football?  In a pool report interview with The Washington Post’s Nicki Jhabvala, Adrian Hill, the referee who made the call, explained why he penalized Henry for what appeared to be a clean, textbook hit on Patriots quarterback Mac Jones. “The defender came down with forcible contact, chest-to-chest,” Hill said. “He didn’t perform one of those acts to remove most of that body weight — a gator roll or a clear to the side when he was coming in. He came down directly with that force on the player.” As actor Jeffrey Wright, a   and longtime Commanders fan,  : “Never in the history of the NFL has there been a worse call. Period.” The referees also missed a   on a deep pass for Terry McLaurin that fell incomplete and a clear  on a third-down pass intended for Logan Thomas. Not every missed call went against Washington; Commanders linebacker Jamin Davis got away with a blatant face mask in the fourth quarter. During last week’s loss to the Eagles, Rivera failed to challenge an apparent incomplete pass to DeVonta Smith that was ruled a catch on the field. Afterward, Rivera explained that he was waiting to see a replay of the play, which led to a Philadelphia touchdown. In a similar situation Sunday, after a 22-yard catch by Patriots wideout Demario Douglas early in the fourth quarter appeared to hit the ground, Rivera didn’t make the same mistake. He threw his red challenge flag and the call was overturned. On the next play, Davis broke up a third-down pass intended for Rhamondre Stevenson, forcing a Patriots punt. They were a disaster from the opening kickoff, which Antonio Gibson returned for 37 yards, to the bitter end, which saw Bill Belichick’s squad fall to 2-7 with its first loss to Washington at home since   in 1996. New England’s special teams unit committed four penalties on Commanders punts in the fourth quarter, including an offsides call on Mack Wilson that gave Washington a fresh set of downs and forced Belichick to use his final two timeouts before the two-minute warning. New England started its final drive from its own 9 after Brenden Schooler’s holding penalty on Tress Way’s final punt. Bad day at the office for Patriots special teams. — 37-yard kick return to start the game — Demario Douglas’ -2 yard return — Bryce Baringer’s touchback from the Patriots’ 47-yard line — Two flags for Brenden Schooler — Mack Wilson’s offsides penalty Facing third and 23 at the Washington 44-yard line after taking his first sack late in the first half, Howell dropped back to pass. Finding no one open, he stepped up, tucked the ball as he reached the line of scrimmage and ran. Around the Patriots’ 43-yard line, Howell broke a pair of tackles by defensive backs Jalen Mills and Adrian Phillips, managed to stay on his feet and rumbled another 10 yards before barreling over defensive back Jack Jones as he stepped out of bounds past the first-down marker. It was the longest run of Howell’s career. TAKE IT YOURSELF, SAM!  📺  : FOX  Later in the same drive, on first and goal from the New England 5, Howell rolled to his right and lofted a pass into the end zone. Jahan Dotson and Logan Thomas were both in the area, but the ill-advised throw led to an easy interception by Patriots safety Kyle Dugger. At halftime, Rivera told Fox sideline reporter Shannon Spake that Howell got “a little greedy” on the play. “That’s probably one of the worst plays I’ve ever made in my football career,”  , who has thrown at least one interception in each of the past three games. Howell played well outside of the pick, completing 29 of 45 passes for 325 yards and a perfectly thrown 33-yard touchdown strike to Jahan Dotson.

He had another five catches for 42 yards against the Patriots, and added six carries for a season-high 34 yards, to go along with his long kickoff return.

"NEW YORK — Kris Letang became   with five assists in the second for the Pittsburgh Penguins, who scored six times in the period and beat the New York Islanders 7-0 on Wednesday night. Letang finished with six assists and was the first player at any position in Penguins history with five in a period. NEW YORK — Kris Letang became   with five assists in the second for the Pittsburgh Penguins, who scored six times in the period and beat the New York Islanders 7-0 on Wednesday night. Letang finished with six assists and was the first player at any position in Penguins history with five in a period. “That’s an unbelievable feat when you think about it,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. “Especially in today’s game when the parity in the league is so high. Against a good team like the Islanders, it’s not an easy thing to do. Couldn’t be happier for him, obviously he’s an elite player for us.” Jake Guentzel and Evgeni Malkin each scored twice in the second period for the Penguins, and Tristan Jarry finished with 21 saves for his fourth shutout of the season. Rickard Rakell, Radim Zohorna and Valtteri Puustinen also scored for Pittsburgh. Marcus Pettersson picked up four assists. Ilya Sorokin made 19 saves as the Islanders’ nine-game point streak on home ice (6-0-3) came to an end. Semyon Varlamov replaced Sorokin to begin the third period and made six saves. Pittsburgh’s six goals came during a stretch of 10:27 in the second. “After a break, the first period is always ugly,” Letang said after his record-setting performance. “After that, once your legs get going, your hands are coming back, we took advantage offensively, played in their zone, putting pucks at the net. ... When you come back and you are about to win a game against a division rival like this and somebody you are chasing, it’s huge.” Guentzel scored twice within 12 seconds to give the Penguins a 3-0 lead. He cleverly redirected Letang’s shot that was headed wide of the net past Sorokin prior to converting a breakaway. Letang took advantage of a gap in the Islanders’ neutral-zone coverage and hit Guentzel with a pass in stride behind New York’s defense. Islanders coach Lane Lambert called timeout between Guentzel’s goals in an effort to get control of the game, but the Penguins continued to convert and capitalize on the Islanders’ poor defensive structure. “It’s timely,” Sullivan said of Guentzel’s goals. “Anytime you have those situations after goals are scored on either side, timeouts are taken or things of that nature, they’re opportunities for momentum to change or to build. When Jake scores that one, that was a huge one as far as building on the momentum that we already established.” Malkin extended the lead to four goals when Reilly Smith found him all alone in the slot at 12:48. Malkin struck again later on a pass from Letang, his fourth assist of the period. Zohorna capped off the six-goal period with his fourth of the season at 17:13. “When you have momentum, you have to capitalize,” Pettersson said. “We stayed around the puck, we were hungry on the puck, everyone wanted pucks, it’s easy to play that way.” Pittsburgh scored six goals in a period on the road for the first time since March 21, 2000, also against the Islanders. Islanders defenseman Noah Dobson was on the ice for four goals while Pittsburgh outshot New York 20-7 in the middle period. Rakell buried a loose puck that squeaked past Sorokin at 6:44 of the second period to kick off the outburst. “It was just a very poorly played second period of hockey,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “Every time we turned around the puck was in our net.” Puustinen converted a one-time feed from Letang midway through the third period for his first NHL goal.

A replay is never going to look good. I know my intentions. My intentions were to sell the call. I don’t think I’m an accurate enough puncher to do a full 360 and connect with someone. It’s unfortunate. ... It was hard contact. I think the flagrant 2 was warranted.” Nurkic was able to continue playing after the incident and finished with 17 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. “It just looked like a reckless, dangerous play,” Suns Coach Frank Vogel said. “I’m sensitive to our guys getting hit on plays like that. I didn’t like it. The refs did what they had to do, and the league will do what they have to do.” Suns guard Devin Booker added: “[Green] wears his emotions as every top competitor does. It got out of hand.” With Green back in the locker room, Golden State fell behind by double digits early in the fourth quarter before mounting a furious rally in the closing minutes that came up short. Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said that he had “no comment” about Green’s flagrant blow because he hadn’t seen a replay. “[Losing Green was a] huge swing,” Kerr said. “We kind of felt good about having him at the five and spreading the floor. ... I felt good about having him out there, and he lost his poise. ... We need Draymond. He knows that. We’ve talked to him. He’s got to find a way to keep his poise and be out there for his teammates.” Green’s latest ejection comes less than one month after he was   for putting Rudy Gobert in a headlock less than two minutes into a 104-101 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 14. In announcing that suspension, the longest of Green’s 12-year career, the league said the four-time all-star escalated an altercation involving teammate Klay Thompson and Minnesota’s Jaden McDaniels, that he was guilty of “an unsportsmanlike and dangerous” action toward Gobert and that his “history of unsportsmanlike acts” had factored into the suspension’s length. The suspension cost Green more than $769,000 of his $22.3 million salary. Before his ejection for the Gobert incident, Green was tossed from Warriors’ 118-110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 11 for shoving Donovan Mitchell from behind during a transition play. Green is no stranger to ejections and suspensions: He was ejected from Game 2 and suspended for Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Sacramento Kings in April for  . As it did in its statement following the Gobert suspension, the NBA noted at the time the suspension was “based in part on Green’s history of unsportsmanlike acts.” Perhaps most famously,   below the belt during the 2016 NBA Finals, prompting a one-game suspension that helped swing the series in favor of the Cavaliers. In October 2022,   at practice. Poole was traded to the Washington Wizards in June, one week before the Warriors signed Green to a four-year, $100 million contract extension. The Warriors, who fell to 10-13 with the loss to the Suns, sit 11th in the Western Conference standings. Golden State’s next five games are against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday, the Boston Celtics on Dec. 19 and the Wizards on Dec. 22.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/13/warriors-draymond-green-ejected-flagrant-blow-jusuf-nurkics-face/,Washington Post,2023-12-13 01:55:00,

The Michigan decision provides Trump with a new victory as he tries to get himself restored to the ballot in Colorado and avoid getting knocked off the ballot in other states.  bars from office those who engaged in insurrection after swearing an oath to uphold the nation’s founding document. The amendment was adopted three years after the end of the Civil War, and the section on insurrectionists was meant to keep former Confederates out of office. Trump’s opponents have argued that the provision prevents him from running because of his actions leading up to and during the   as Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s victory. They have filed lawsuits around the country to try to keep Trump off the ballot. 1 / 6 In Michigan, a lower court judge and an appeals court said Trump   there. Those courts determined that state law allows political parties to determine which candidates can run in presidential primaries and doesn’t allow election officials to keep them off the ballot under Section 3. The courts reached no conclusions about whether Trump had engaged in insurrection. The Michigan Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would not take up the case, allowing the appeals court   to stand. In dissent, Justice Elizabeth Welch argued that the state’s high court should have taken up the case on the merits. She wrote that she agreed with the appeals court’s finding that the secretary of state can’t keep candidates off the ballot under Section 3. The high court in Colorado went in a different direction, finding in a 4-3 ruling last week that Trump engaged in insurrection and is ineligible to appear on the ballot in that state. It temporarily suspended its ruling to give Trump time to seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. If Trump appeals — as he has said he will — the Colorado Supreme Court will keep its stay in place. Michigan’s primary is Feb. 27, and Colorado’s is March 5. Trump praised the Michigan court’s decision not to get involved in the case, writing on social media that the challenges to his candidacy are a “pathetic gambit to rig the Election.” Mark Brewer, an attorney for the voters who filed the Michigan lawsuit, said challenges to Trump’s candidacy will continue. The Michigan rulings have focused on Trump’s ability to run in the Republican primary, and Brewer said voters may argue against Trump’s eligibility to run for office during the general election campaign. “Trump led a rebellion and insurrection against the Constitution when he tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election and he is disqualified from ever seeking or holding public office again,” Brewer said in a written statement. The Michigan case was filed with the help of the liberal group Free Speech For People. The group lost a similar challenge before the Minnesota Supreme Court and has a case pending before the Oregon Supreme Court. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows (D) is expected to decide soon whether Trump can appear on the ballot in her state. Bellows held a day-long hearing on the matter this month in response to a challenge filed by Maine voters. Attorneys for Trump asked Bellows on Wednesday to disqualify herself from considering the case because of past comments she has made about the attack on the U.S. Capitol. In social media posts in 2021, she called the riot an insurrection and said she supported Trump’s impeachment for the attack.

"CHICAGO — Connor Bedard scored his second goal of the game at 2:15 of a frantic overtime, leading the Chicago Blackhawks to a 2-1 win over the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday night. Bedard, who leads NHL rookies in scoring, sent a wrist shot under the glove of Winnipeg’s Connor Hellebuyck for the first OT goal of his career and his 15th of the season as Chicago earned just its second win in eight games. CHICAGO — Connor Bedard scored his second goal of the game at 2:15 of a frantic overtime, leading the Chicago Blackhawks to a 2-1 win over the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday night. Bedard, who leads NHL rookies in scoring, sent a wrist shot under the glove of Winnipeg’s Connor Hellebuyck for the first OT goal of his career and his 15th of the season as Chicago earned just its second win in eight games. “It was obviously nice to get the winner in overtime,” said Bedard, who recorded his third two-goal game. “I don’t know if I thought about it overly, but it feels nice.” Bedard has three goals in his last two games and extended his points streak to five games. The 18-year-old center has three goals and five assists in the span and 14 goals and 32 points in 34 games overall. He is the third-youngest player in NHL history to score his first OT goal. At 18 years, 163 days, he is behind Sidney Crosby (18 years, 101 days), who scored on Nov. 16, 2005, and Jordan Staal (18 years, 153 days), who scored on Feb. 10, 2007. “He’s a guy that it’s hard to know when he releases the puck because he’s coming down and he can shoot it at any time,” Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. “He seems to hold on to it longer than other people and still get a hard enough shot off that’s going to beat a world-class goalie like that.” Morgan Barron scored in regulation for Winnipeg, which lost for the second time in 11 contests (8-1-2). “I felt like we carried the play for a lot of the game,” Barron said. “For the first game after the (Christmas) break, you obviously want to come away with a win. But to get a point and to play well, it’s going to help us kind of get back on track.” Petr Mrazek made 37 saves for Chicago as Winnipeg built a 38-25 advantage in shots on goal. The 31-year-old Czech goalie had another solid effort in a resurgent season after a groin injury dogged him for two years. “Give Mrazek a lot of credit,” Jets coach Rick Bowness said. “He was outstanding. Four goalposts and a crossbar. It was just one of those nights for him. We certainly created enough opportunities in the hockey game. We didn’t score.” Hellebuyck finished with 23 saves. The Jets dominated early and took the first eight shots on goal. The sellout crowd of 20,540 groaned a derisive cheer when Chicago’s Anthony Beauvillier finally wristed the Blackhawks’ first shot on Hellebuyck with 5:04 left in the first. Then, the Blackhawks came on with a flurry as Bedard opened the scoring with 4:03 remaining. Connor Murphy held the puck in on the right boards, then fed Bedard in the right circle for a one-timer. Hellebuyck stopped it, but Bedard charged to the net and scored on the rebound. “I just kept kind of whacking it and eventually it went in,” Bedard said. “You gotta have some of those kind of garbage ones and that might have been my first one like that.” The Jets took over again in the second. Barron tied it at 1 at 3:47, taking a cross-ice pass from Axel Jonsson-Fjallby and scoring between Mrazek’s pads. Mrazek was sharp the rest of the period as Winnipeg outshot Chicago 14-7 in the frame. Among his best stops was a close-in glove save on Nikolaj Ehlers with just over 6 minutes left. Dominic Toninato, playing his first game this season for Winnipeg, hit the post with a shot midway through the scoreless third. The Blackhawks killed a penalty to Jarred Tinordi for tripping Nino Niederreiter with 2:56 left in regulation. Depleted Chicago got boost from the return of rookie defenseman Alex Vlasic, who missed four games with a shoulder injury. Veteran forward Tyler Johnson played after missing one game. Earlier Wednesday, coach Luke Richardson said top defenseman Seth Jones, out since Dec. 10 with a shoulder injury, is expected to resume skating in about a week. Toninato replaced David Gustafsson, a late scratch with a lower-body injury. UP NEXT: Jets: Host Minnesota on Saturday.

Their interest in joining the WNBA family is yet another sign of the league’s growth potential.” In a news conference Thursday, Engelbert said the league’s “goal is to have a 14th team by 2025 as well” and said discussions are underway with several cities. Lacob and Guber will own and operate the new team, which will play its home games at Chase Center in San Francisco, which is also the home of the Warriors. Golden State’s team facility in Oakland, which served as the Warriors’ practice location and housed the team’s front office from 1997 to 2019, will be the WNBA team’s headquarters. The new squad will be the first added since the Atlanta Dream joined the league 15 years ago. The WNBA’s television deal with ESPN is set to expire after the 2025 season, and the league expects the value of its next deal to significantly increase. The league just completed its most-watched regular season in 21 years; viewership on ABC, CBS, ESPN and ESPN2 was up 21 percent. Adding franchises will boost the value of the league’s next TV deal even more — particularly a new team in a market such as San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, the 10th largest in the country, per Nielsen. A richer media contract would have a major impact on league finances and could affect anything from player salaries to travel accommodations. Engelbert had previously said the WNBA’s goal was to add two franchises and that it would take 18 months to get a team on the court after the league decided on a city. “There’s this moment over the next three to five years of women’s sports where we’re going to set the course for the next 30 or 40 years,” Engelbert  . “But it’s the next three to five years that’s going to determine a long way out, as far as, ‘Can we be the first women’s sports property to really get a meaningful media rights deal?’ Clearly the more cities you’re in … the more viewership you’ll have and the more that would be valued in a media model.” The WNBA Finals start Sunday with the top-seeded Las Vegas Aces hosting the second-seeded New York Liberty to begin a best-of-five series.

What is a Famous Toastery? Is that toast or a toasting device or a toasting location? I do not care. I want that. I will watch that. If you don’t, that’s fine; there’s no shortage of demands on the American schedule during the holiday season. But none will ask less of you than the Famous Toastery Bowl. It’s consequence-free football, and it will be there if you need it. Consider that this weekend when you’re stuck at a significant other’s holiday party or you’re desperate to avoid discussing politics (or even worse, yourself) with family. That’s when you will remember the Radiance Technologies Independence Bowl is on and you can watch 6-6 California and 6-6 Texas Tech scrimmage the night away in a northwest Louisiana casino town as a “reward” for their “great seasons,” bankrolled by an opaque-sounding  . We need more Radiance Technologies Independence Bowls, not fewer. It’s true the postseason bowl system is partially responsible for college football’s stunted growth and tail-wagging-dog management but not  bowls. The Independence Bowl isn’t orchestrating anything other than an otherwise forgettable good time in reasonably affordable Shreveport, La. Will you remember the game in two days? Doubtful. Would you pay $400 to watch it again four months from now during the football desert of the spring? Yep. The uncomfortable rule of thumb is that the more prestigious the bowl game, the more toxic its influence on the sport. If you’re still mad about  , blame the cartel of bowls — the Fiesta, Peach, Cotton and Rose (especially the  — that blocked playoff development for decades and then begrudgingly agreed to a minimized four-team bracket smaller than the five power conferences it was built to accommodate. In two weeks, we will be asked to invest in the invisible stakes of the final, ludicrous iteration of the “New Year’s Six.” Two bowls (this year it’s the Rose and Sugar) will host actual, meaningful playoff games (that’s good!), while four others (the Peach, Fiesta, Cotton and Orange) will boast entirely worthless exhibitions among a smattering of very, very good teams that just missed the cut for the real postseason. All of these games (No. 9 Missouri vs. No. 7 Ohio State, No. 11 Mississippi vs. No. 10 Penn State, No. 6 Georgia vs. No. 5 Florida State and No. 23 Liberty vs. No. 8 Oregon) would be appointment viewing if they actually mattered at all. Instead, thanks solely to the arrested scope afforded by bowl tampering, we have a four-team playoff and then these . . . other games. Last week I spoke to staff members at three of the schools playing in these games about unrelated matters, and all three volunteered how little they or their programs actually cared about the outcome of these meaningless exhibitions. Of course, none of those schools would dare say that publicly, but their behavior already does: As you trace the bowl schedule from now until January, with games supposedly increasing in “significance,” you will find an actual increase in interim coaches, departed coordinators and players gone to the transfer portal or opting out to prepare for the NFL draft. Expect   about those last two on the next “College GameDay” but nary a peep about coaches skipping out. And before you or Herbstreit begin to wax romantically about the Rose Bowl or any of these games, please understand this: I do not care about a Pasadena sunset on New Year’s Day. I am not from the Midwest; I am from the South, where we stopped caring about saying stuff like “Sugar Bowl Champions!” 30 years ago and where global warming and an accessible Gulf Coast means we can demand a 12-team national postseason free of bowl influence and still enjoy a 65-degree January in romantic Pensacola. There will be no Rose Bowl-level pretension in Mobile, Ala., on Dec. 23, when 6-6 South Alabama hosts 6-6 Eastern Michigan in the 68 Ventures Bowl. (I had to look up that one. It’s real estate. My first guess was Crypto.) What a public service this game is! That’s two days before Christmas! You could talk to an elderly loved one about the latest Hillary Clinton “news story” they found on “The Facebook,” or you could let .500 Group of Five football gently (and politely!) wash over any need for conversation. Sure, the 68 Ventures Bowl (seriously, that sounds like a web site you would be afraid to click on) is equally irrelevant to — if not more irrelevant than — Florida State and Georgia playing for absolutely nothing in the Orange Bowl, but it’s supposed to be. And that’s the point: Bowls used to serve as rarefied, meaningful showcases for a sport lacking enough confederation to create a champion. But then TV money came in, and these oddity events wielded “tradition” to fend off logic, and calls for sensible postseason reform were fought tooth and nail by the bowl cartel. Meanwhile, cable television inventory demands exploded the number of games, rendering their significance moot. It all led us to a modern landscape where it’s suitable to poke fun at the random Goofy Sponsor Bowl in mid-December but still a formality to care about this year’s equally arbitrary Peach or Cotton Bowl, just because the schools and stadiums are bigger. No thank you. College football is terminally American, therefore I will do my part by rejecting tyrannical governing structures while simultaneously consuming blandness. I will not watch New Year’s Six games in which the programs themselves would rather be doing something else. I will, however, attempt to watch six completely arbitrary FBS bowl games this weekend. The future of bowls is in doubt thanks to the playoff expansion set to arrive next year. As of this writing, the scheduled first-round home games in the new 12-team format are under fire by bowl officials desperate to move those games to neutral-site NFL stadiums like the quarterfinal and semifinal games, all to charge stupidly expensive ticket prices and sell hotel blocks. Those are the concerns of important bowls, and important bowls have a 100 percent history of acting against the best interest of the sport. The Myrtle Beach Bowl is not important. But the team I grew up cheering for, Georgia Southern, will play Ohio in Myrtle Beach, S.C., at 11 a.m. Saturday. If Georgia Southern wins, it will provide little to salve a disappointing 6-6 season and a four-game losing streak. If Ohio wins, I probably will shrug and forget the details of the game in a few days. This behavior will appropriately reflect the merit and significance of the game. It will be an honest transaction among the fine people at the Myrtle Beach tourism board, myself, and ESPN charging ad rates for live sports instead of replaying a talk show, all without affecting or arresting college football’s postseason. It is football, and I will watch it. It is an American birthright that this sport distract us during uncomfortable times. The smaller and more meaningless the bowl game, the more ethically sourced that distraction is.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/15/obscure-college-football-bowl-games/,Washington Post,2023-12-15 05:00:00,

A star was born and a desert city glittering with fabrications and folly served as the labor room. A crew of media partners and men who had once gone through a similar birthing process acted as the midwives. And out of   arrived a point guard named Tyrese Haliburton. The NBA’s newest  The tournament didn’t end pleasantly for the freshly anointed prince. LeBron James, almost 39 years old and still not ready to cede authority as the face of the league, hoisted the first NBA Cup as . The moment belonged to the established legend, but if we were paying close attention, we watched the NBA play the game it knows so well: How to make a star. It started with a “ That may be the catchphrase that detonates from the mouth of ESPN play-by-play man Mike Breen, but it was apropos for Haliburton’s thundering entrance into the mainstream. Late in  , Haliburton had the ball in his hands, and on cue, the NBA’s broadcasters sensed what was happening. When Haliburton hit the dagger three that helped propel the Pacers to the IST championship game, suddenly a 23-year-old who has spent the entirety of his career in midsize cities transformed from small-market starter into league darling. “Bang! Tyrese Haliburton from downtown!” Breen announced. “We are witnessing a superstar in the making!” former NBA player Reggie Miller crowed. And no one loves a superstar quite like the NBA. Major League Baseball has its history and its stats. The National Hockey League possesses the fervor of its loyal base. And if enemy extraterrestrials point a death beam toward Earth, the only survivors would be cockroaches and the National Football League. The NBA, more than the three other major American professional leagues, relies and thrives on the presence of personalities. If this wasn’t true, then the NBA wouldn’t have turned arena tunnels into fashion shoots. And line wouldn’t be superimposed on playing surfaces during nationally televised games. We never would have been blessed with those “You The Real MVP” punchlines and the shots of all-stars overcome by laughter during Fergie’s rendition of the national anthem had this league been solely committed to basketball and not the guilty-pleasure entertainment it produces on a nightly basis. This is a serious sports league, as well as a vineyard abundant with low-hanging fruit. An unscripted reality TV show where dunks matter, sure, but so does the drama. That’s why we, still, love this game. Lucky for us, the NBA never allows itself to remain stagnant and nourished by yesterday’s clicks. It’s zeal to stay relevant may look thirsty, but no one can never accuse the league of being boring. That’s what sets the NBA apart from its peers. So when the NBA toyed around with traditional concepts in the effort to capture more eyeballs in November and December —   in preparation for a new media rights deal in 2025 — it desperately needed its resident megastar, LeBron, to understand the significance of the moment and treat the in-season tournament like it mattered. LeBron did so, but his reign can only last so long. For years, the league has been bracing for a reality without its “King” by building up his potential successors. Young superstars ready to be The Face of this global game. These efforts have worked, as fans learned how to effortlessly pronounce names like Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic. But among the under-30 players born in America, their star-making process keeps hitting a snag. Beyond Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum, who has built his résumé in an ideal media market that has a rich NBA history, the room for young American superstars feels empty. Trae Young’s popularity has cooled off. Ja Morant couldn’t stop flashing guns and therefore  . Former No. 1 phenom  being a punchline and eating his way into the crosshairs of his  . And while the spotlight of superstardom may soon shine on 22-year-old Anthony Edwards, his Minnesota Timberwolves aren’t staples on national television and the hype machine might still be cautious about embracing a kid who thought it was wise to post   before the start of last season. It was in this climate, a particular kind of intersection for the league, that the NBA put on its in-season show. And it discovered the magnetic smile and joyful presence that is Haliburton. Though there are too many syllables there, his name still rolls off the tongue as a mix between an  and something you’d expect to see written beneath a medieval coat of arms. His game, too, feels like a gumbo, a helping of jump passes and set shots thrown into the new school pace of today’s game. During his breakout moments of the knockout round, the young point guard played like a star, producing a combined 53 points, 28 assists and no turnovers against Tatum’s Celtics and then Antetokounmpo’s Bucks. He celebrated like one, pointing to his wrist after his big-time three-pointer as a cheeky way to commandeer Damian Lillard’s “Dame Time” bit. Then he beamed like one in front of every camera the league and its media partners turned his way. When Tyrese and his father John joined the “NBA on TNT” crew, with Shaquille O’Neal saying it was “a joy watching you today,” and Ernie Johnson skillfully weaving in talking points from Haliburton’s bio, it seemed apparent that his origin story would be the NBA’s next heartwarming narrative. The kid from Oshkosh, Wis. with the funky jump shot and an exuberance to share the ball. His father, an everyman who cheers for his son each game as though he’s watching him for the first time. Overlooked out of Iowa State by 11 NBA teams but somehow, someway he clawed himself out of obscurity. In reality, however, Haliburton shouldn’t be such of an unknown to the regulars. He was a lottery pick only three years ago and an all-star in 2022. But since he entered the league with the Sacramento Kings and now plays in Indianapolis, the NBA can introduce him to the public as though he magically appeared from the cornfields. And his arrival continued in full blast as long as the networks had a tournament to promote. Though Miller has a clear bias — of course, the Pacers legend would call a fellow Pacer a “superstar” — he wasn’t the only NBA stakeholder to lend his voice and platform to the promotion of Haliburton. On two separate occasions during ESPN’s NBA coverage, former Golden State Warriors executive Bob Myers played the role of the general manager who regretted not drafting Haliburton. Also, Stephen A. Smith hammed it up as the New York Knicks fan stricken with grief because his favorite team had passed on Haliburton. Statements like these from trusted personalities make for good television, but also create a national conversation around the latest player chosen to be a face of the league. So fans didn’t just watch Haliburton’s arrival, they were spoon-fed it by the NBA and the media companies that own a stake in showcasing the league. Whether he’s ready for it or not, Haliburton now has the spotlight, and just in time for the lead up to Indianapolis serving as the host city for the 2024 All-Star Weekend. He’ll be the league’s fresh face for its glamour event. This star-loving league has been searching for its next all-American hero. And once the NBA is done elevating Haliburton to celebrity status, it’ll be time to create a new star once again.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/13/tyrese-haliburton-nba-star/,Washington Post,2023-12-13 06:15:00,

Between 2007 and 2018, Torrent was a chief assistant to Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.

Baltimore Orioles infielder Gunnar Henderson and Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll, crucial pieces of what proved to be transformative seasons for their franchises, were named American League and National League rookies of the year Monday night. Henderson is Baltimore’s first winner since Gregg Olson in 1989 and the team’s first position player winner since Cal Ripken Jr. Ripken announced Henderson as the winner on MLB Network. Carroll, whose award was announced by Derek Jeter, is the first player in the 25-year history of the Diamondbacks to win the honor. Members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America vote on the awards, though The Washington Post does not permit its writers to vote. Both Henderson and Carroll received 30 of 30 first-place votes. The next-highest vote-getter to either was New York Mets starter Kodai Senga, who pitched to a 2.98 ERA in 29 starts in his first MLB season. At 30, Senga would have been the oldest winner since 32-year-old Kazuhiro Sasaki in the AL in 2000. At 22,   as the heart of Baltimore’s young offense in his first full season, overcoming an early slump to cement himself in the middle of the Orioles’ order. He led Baltimore with an .814 OPS and finished second to catcher Adley Rutschman in wins above replacement while providing strong defense at shortstop and third base. He led all rookies with 28 homers and was crucial to the Orioles’ push for the AL East title. Having Ripken present his award carried extra weight for Henderson. “He’s one of the best to ever do it. Having him for support, for him to take time out of his day to do this, come into the clubhouse and stuff, it’s been pretty special to have a guy like that. I can’t thank him enough for all he’s done, and I look forward to many conversations with him,” Henderson said. While Henderson’s offense was remarkable, he said he was most proud of his work with his glove. “I feel like people kind of had an idea of what I could do at the plate, but I guess they kind of didn’t really know about my defense. I was glad to get out there and show I could play major league shortstop and third base.” Carroll finished second among rookies with 25 homers — though those homers were more footnote than headline for the speedy savant. At 23, Carroll established himself as one of the game’s more troublesome pests. He hit .285 with an .868 OPS that did not even reflect the fact that he regularly turned walks and singles into doubles with 54 stolen bases. The outfielder, known for a dogged  , put together a season that was nearly charmed from start to finish. He hit 18 homers in a first half that earned him starting honors in the All-Star Game — a game played in his hometown of Seattle. He keyed a Diamondbacks team that operated in his image, pushing its way to the top of the NL West early before convincing the rest of the sport it could stay there all year. “It wasn’t an easy season for us. We had plenty of tough moments. To be able to fight through those and come out the other side, I think that just made us a more connected and dangerous team,” Carroll said. “I think that’s what you saw in the playoffs.” Eventually, Arizona emerged as one of the most statistically improbable NL pennant winners of the modern era, and Carroll was central in its surprising win over   in the NL Championship Series. The rookie honors also mean the Orioles and Diamondbacks are awarded picks late in the first round of next year’s draft as part of a provision added to the collective bargaining agreement to incentivize teams to call up elite prospects sooner than later. “That’s probably what brought the most weight to chasing something like this,” Carroll said. “… Not for the personal fame or attention but that ability to benefit my team.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/13/gunnar-henderson-corbin-carroll-rookie-year/,Washington Post,2023-11-13 19:17:00,

Washington lost a road   to the Seahawks in January 2006 and a  two years later but is 7-1 in all other road games against Seattle. As you might expect, that’s the franchise’s best regular season road record against any team. (Washington is a franchise-worst 0-5 all-time   in Kansas City.) Like   featuring a Commanders logo inside the silhouette of the state of Washington, the Burgundy and Gold’s regular season success in the Emerald City is difficult to explain. The Seahawks have won 117 regular season games at home since their current stadium, now known as Lumen Field, opened in 2002, which is the fifth most in the NFL during that span. Washington is 4-0 during the regular season in the  , where fans known as     and generally make life miserable for opposing offenses. Excluding the Seahawks’ NFC West division foes, only the Atlanta Falcons, who are 4-3 in seven regular season games at Lumen Field, have as many wins in Seattle as Washington since 2002. Every team except Washington has lost there. The Seahawks, who are 3-1 at home this year, are 1-4 as home favorites in the regular season against Washington, including an 0-3 record at Lumen Field. Washington is an underdog again Sunday, and while the team’s history of success in Seattle has no bearing on the outcome of how it fares in Sam Howell’s first trip there, it’s a good excuse to remember some games and names.  |  In Washington’s first visit to the Kingdome, which The Washington Post’s Gary Pomerantz accurately described as a “cement mushroom in downtown Seattle,” Joe Theismann completed 9 of 16 passes for 162 yards and three touchdowns. John Riggins ran for 83 yards on 30 carries to move into sixth place on the NFL’s all-time rushing list, and Washington’s defense limited Seahawks rookie Curt Warner, the league’s leading rusher coming into the game, to 34 yards. Vernon Dean intercepted Seattle quarterback (and future Washington coach) Jim Zorn with nine minutes remaining to seal the win, which improved Washington to 3-1.  |  Washington spoiled legendary Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent’s goodbye with its first shutout since 1984 and its fifth straight win in the regular season finale for both teams. The Post reported that Largent headed straight for the locker room and missed the tribute video — set to Barbra Streisand’s “The Way We Were” — the Seahawks prepared for him after the game. “When you lose, 29-0, you can’t wait to get off the football field,” Largent said. In his first NFL start in the state where he starred in high school and college, Washington quarterback Mark Rypien threw for 290 yards, including a 44-yard touchdown to Gary Clark. Washington finished 10-6 but missed the playoffs for a second straight year. “We were at an all-time low after [a 13-3 loss to Dallas on Nov. 5],” Coach Joe Gibbs said. “… I’m proud of the way we finished.”  |  Rypien completed 21 of 30 passes for 248 yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to tight end Terry Orr that snapped a Washington offensive touchdown drought that spanned 14 quarters. “It was so nice to find the end zone and do something to help this team win a game,” Gibbs said after the defending Super Bowl champions improved to 6-3. “We kind of got it going the second half.” Linebacker Wilber Marshall had an interception, a sack and a forced fumble for Washington, which was without several regulars because of injury. Linebacker John Brantley, a late cut in training camp who was re-signed in October and started in place of Kurt Gouveia, made 10 tackles and recovered a fumble. Offensive lineman Joe Jacoby was expected to miss the game with a pinched nerve but was forced into action after Moe Elewonibi sprained his knee in the first half. “Joe Jacoby is a hero,” Gibbs said afterward.  | Steve Broussard returned the opening kickoff 90 yards for a Seahawks touchdown, and it wouldn’t get much better for Washington from there in its first and only regular season loss in Seattle. Trent Green was intercepted twice, Terry Allen lost a fumble, and David Akers missed a pair of field goals in his debut as Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 1981. “We’re making the kind of mistakes that keep us from winning right now,” Coach Norv Turner said. “And we’ve got to eliminate them.” Michael Westbrook caught two touchdown passes and Washington outgained Seattle 465-299, but the turnovers and a big day by Seahawks running back Ricky Watters (136 yards and a touchdown) proved too much to overcome. The loss was somewhat overshadowed locally by the news of Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. sitting out a game for the first time in more than 16 years.  |  Shane Matthews completed only 10 of 27 passes for 114 yards, but two of them were first-half touchdowns to Darnerien McCants and Rod Gardner, and that was more than enough for Washington’s defense in its first trip to the Seahawks’ new stadium. “It was an unusual game for all the games I’ve coached,” first-year Washington coach Steve Spurrier said after his team evened its record at 4-4. Running back Kenny Watson, who made his first career start in place of the injured Stephen Davis, rushed for 110 yards on 23 carries, and Washington sacked Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck four times.  |  Clinton Portis rushed for 143 yards to help Washington snap a two-game skid and improve to 7-4 in Zorn’s triumphant return to Seattle. “He was a warrior,” Zorn, Washington’s first-year coach, said of Portis, who was questionable for the game after missing most of practice the previous week with a sprained knee. Former Seahawks cornerback Shawn Springs made the game-sealing interception with 1:20 to play, dropping Seattle to 2-9. Washington quarterback Jason Campbell was 20 for 33 for 206 yards and a touchdown.   were hard to come by down the stretch for Zorn’s squad, which lost four of its final five games to miss the playoffs.  | Washington ended a six-game losing streak in Mike Shanahan’s second year at the helm by overcoming a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit. Rookie Roy Helu rushed for 108 yards, including a 28-yard touchdown that pulled Washington within 17-14, and Rex Grossman’s 50-yard TD pass to Anthony Armstrong in Washington’s 16-point fourth quarter put the Burgundy and Gold ahead for good. DeAngelo Hall intercepted Tarvaris Jackson with 37 seconds remaining to ice the game. “It’s a tough place to play in Seattle,” Grossman said. “It’s very loud, it’s a very long trip, so it’s pretty rewarding to win and also to come back from 10 points down to win.”  |  Washington’s most improbable win in Seattle is also its most recent. After Russell Wilson’s 30-yard touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin gave the Seahawks a 14-10 lead with 1:34 to play, Kirk Cousins needed only 35 seconds to put Washington back on top. The game-winning drive included a 31-yard completion to Brian Quick and the best play of Josh Doctson’s Washington career — a diving, 38-yard catch that set up Rob Kelley’s short touchdown run. Cousins, who was without injured wide receiver Jamison Crowder and tight end Jordan Reed, was sacked six times while operating behind a makeshift offensive line down four starters. “This lets everyone know we can definitely win in the most hostile environment,” tight end Vernon Davis said. “… If we can play under these conditions, it means we can go anywhere.” Washington went on to finish 7-9 and miss the playoffs.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/08/washington-commanders-road-wins-seattle-seahawks/,Washington Post,2023-11-08 17:43:00,

"Nine months. That’s how long it took to reach what seemed to be the predetermined destination of this WNBA season. The Las Vegas Aces will host the New York Liberty in Game 1 of the best-of-five Finals on Sunday — a showdown that began to take shape in January. A trade that sent 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones from the Connecticut Sun to the Liberty was the first big move in what became an offseason arms race.

Nine months. That’s how long it took to reach what seemed to be the predetermined destination of this WNBA season. The Las Vegas Aces will host the New York Liberty in Game 1 of the best-of-five Finals on Sunday — a showdown that began to take shape in January. A trade that sent 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones from the Connecticut Sun to the Liberty was the first big move in what became an offseason arms race. Two weeks later, two-time MVP Candace Parker and Alysha Clark, a two-time champion who would end up being named this season’s sixth woman of the year, signed with the Aces.  , who went on to win her second MVP award, and five-time all-star Courtney Vandersloot went to New York as free agents a week after that. Both organizations were given the superteam label, and oddsmakers made them heavy favorites to meet in October. Now, here they are. “This is the matchup that people have been raving about from its inception,” Aces guard Kelsey Plum said. “And I think that this was inevitable, I guess you could say.” Nearly from start to finish, the Aces and Liberty had the top records in the league. Las Vegas (34-6) ended the regular season with a two-game advantage, but New York (32-8) was in contention for the No. 1 seed until the end. The regular season series was even at 2-2, though the pair met a fifth time in the Commissioner’s Cup final, a 19-point Liberty victory. The Aces got revenge with a 13-point regular season win two days later. The teams battled not only for on-court supremacy but also for league honors. Stewart won her second MVP award, with 2022 MVP A’ja Wilson of the Aces finishing third in the voting. Wilson won her second consecutive defensive player of the year award, and Stewart was named first-team all-defense. Wilson and Stewart were the top all-star vote getters for the second year in a row. The Aces beat the Liberty in the all-star skills challenge, and New York guard Sabrina Ionescu won the three-point contest. Liberty General Manager Jonathan Kolb was named executive of the year. “Certainly, this really could become one of those great rivalries, and I think that’s one of the things that’s been so wonderful about the conversation around A’ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart,” ESPN analyst and Hall of Famer Rebecca Lobo said. “These two young players who are two of the best players in the league and have been since they came into the league, and they’ve been an incredible foil for one another and for their fan bases.” This Aces-Liberty pairing could be the beginning of something substantial. The Aces are the defending champs, with an owner in Mark Davis who has been more than willing to invest in the franchise since purchasing it in 2021, including opening a new practice facility this year. The Liberty, which is in the Finals for the first time since 2002, is the only original franchise still in existence to have never won a WNBA title. It also has aggressive owners in Joe and Clara Tsai, who bought the franchise in 2019. Games in both markets have become places to be seen, with celebrities taking up courtside seats in Las Vegas and New York. “When you get celebrities and mainstream music artists . . . in the building, you bring in a different demographic who now becomes interested in the WNBA,” ESPN analyst LaChina Robinson said. “When we’re able to showcase them on our broadcast, they feel big, like must-see events, which is bringing out people from different parts of the world and entertainment. I think that aspect of it in Vegas and New York has just elevated what we’re feeling off the court in terms of how big this Finals could be and how big the matchups between these two teams can be.” Here are some of the storylines to watch: The sideline will feature two former WNBA players meeting in the Finals as head coaches for the first time. Sandy Brondello took over in New York in 2022 with a résumé that included winning the 2014 championship with the Phoenix Mercury after a season in which she was named coach of the year. Becky Hammon   in 2022 and immediately won a title and was named coach of the year. Hammon played for Brondello in 2010 when Brondello coached the San Antonio Silver Stars. “Just really proud for both of us to be leading some great organizations and playing for a championship final against each other,” Brondello said. “She was one of the smartest players I’ve ever been around. She’s small, but she’s feisty, and she’ll get her team going. I think that’s great for the league.” Hammon was a six-time all-star who spent her first eight seasons with the Liberty. Brondello made one all-star team while playing five seasons with Detroit, Miami and Seattle. “She played a little bit better than me,” Brondello said. The perimeter will feature three No. 1 picks, the league’s No. 2 career assists leader and a two-time champion nicknamed the “Point Gawd.” All five players are multiple-time all-stars, including each of them making this year’s showcase. The Aces feature No. 1 picks Jackie Young (2019) and Plum (2017) to go with point guard Chelsea Gray. Young posted career highs in points (17.6), field goal percentage (52.3) and three-point percentage (44.9), and she has started every regular season game in the past three seasons. She was named the 2022 most improved player and ranked second in the league in three-point percentage this season. Plum was sixth woman of the year in 2021 and all-star MVP in 2022, and she averaged 18.7 points, 4.5 assists and a career-high 1.1 steals in 2023. Gray, a five-time all-star, has two titles and arguably the best nickname in the game. She was the Finals MVP last season and finished the regular season this year with career-high averages in points (15.3) and assists (7.3). Ionescu was drafted by the Liberty with the top pick in 2020 to be the face of the franchise, and she ranked just behind Young with a career-high 44.8 three-point percentage this season. She can quickly take over a game with a barrage of baskets from beyond the arc and has one of the most versatile offensive repertoires of any guard. Vandersloot led the league at 8.1 assists per game in her first season with New York, and only Sue Bird has more career assists. While the series will be loaded with big names, the supporting casts have been vital for both teams. Betnijah Laney started all 40 games for the Liberty and has been an enormous problem for opponents during the playoffs offensively and defensively. The 6-foot wing has scored between 19 and 21 points in five of six games this postseason after averaging 12.8 during the regular season. “[Laney] has been amazing in the playoffs and really just being an ultimate two-way player,” Stewart said. “. . . She’s able to guard the other team’s best perimeter player and also have confidence on the offensive end to take what the defense gives her, to knock in shots and just help make sure that we can continue to push in whatever way possible.” Kiah Stokes moved into the Aces’ starting lineup when Parker was lost to a broken foot after 18 games and played so well that Wilson said she was sharing the defensive player of the year award with Stokes. The 6-3 center averaged 5.9 rebounds and 1.0 blocks as her team allowed the second-fewest points in the league (80.3 per game) and ranked No. 1 in defensive rating (97.7). Clark returned to form with Las Vegas after two rough seasons with Washington. She missed all of 2021 with a foot injury and struggled in 2022 with her second-worst three-point percentage (30.3) since entering the league in 2012. Her hard work and patience led to her being named sixth woman of the year. “Kind of [thinking] back to my Seattle days and just the type of offensive structure that they have here and the read-and-react and just playing off one another,” Clark said. “I was able to kind of bounce back into that mind-set and find that flow and that rhythm again.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/07/wnba-finals-preview-aces-liberty/,Washington Post,2023-10-07 09:00:00,
"The NBA suspended Draymond Green indefinitely Wednesday after the Golden State Warriors star   during a 119-116 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night. The suspension, which is an unusual disciplinary result for a flagrant foul, “takes into account Green’s repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts,” NBA vice president of basketball operations Joe Dumars  . The NBA suspended Draymond Green indefinitely Wednesday after the Golden State Warriors star   during a 119-116 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night. The suspension, which is an unusual disciplinary result for a flagrant foul, “takes into account Green’s repeated history of unsportsmanlike acts,” NBA vice president of basketball operations Joe Dumars  . The ban follows Green’s third ejection of the season and will begin immediately. Green “will be required to meet certain league and team conditions before he returns to play,” the league said. Less than a month ago, Green was   for putting Rudy Gobert in a headlock less than two minutes into a 104-101 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Nov. 14. Green’s blow to Nurkic’s head came with Golden State leading 65-60 and 8:23 remaining in the third quarter of a nationally televised game at Phoenix’s Footprint Center. As the two players battled for position on an inbounds play, Nurkic held the right side of Green’s body in an attempt to prevent him from breaking open to receive a pass, and Green responded by spinning counterclockwise toward Nurkic and wildly swinging his right arm. Video replays showed Green made direct contact with the left side of Nurkic’s face, causing the Bosnian big man to fall to the ground. Green, who didn’t protest the ejection and jogged straight to the locker room, departed with two points, two rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes. During a postgame news conference, the four-time all-star apologized to Nurkic, said the blow was unintentional and acknowledged his ejection was “warranted.” “[Nurkic] was pulling my hip, and I was swinging away to sell the call and made contact with him,” Green said. “As you know, I’m not one to apologize for things I meant to do, but I do apologize to Jusuf because I didn’t intend to hit him. … A replay is never going to look good. I know my intentions. My intentions were to sell the call. I don’t think I’m an accurate enough puncher to do a full 360 and connect with someone. It’s unfortunate.” Nurkic was able to continue playing after the incident and finished with 17 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists. Suns Coach Frank Vogel said Green was guilty of a “reckless, dangerous” play, and all-star guard Devin Booker added that Green’s emotions “got out of hand.” “What’s going on with him? I don’t know,” Nurkic said of Green. “Personally, I feel like that brother needs help. I’m glad he didn’t try to choke me. At the same time, it ain’t nothing to do with basketball. I’m just out there trying to play basketball. He’s out there swinging. I think we saw that often. I hope whatever he’s got [going on] in his life, it gets better.” With Green back in the locker room, Golden State fell behind by double digits early in the fourth quarter before mounting a furious rally in the closing minutes that came up short. Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said he had “no comment” about Green’s flagrant blow because he hadn’t seen a replay. “[Losing Green was a] huge swing,” Kerr said. “We kind of felt good about having him at the five and spreading the floor. … I felt good about having him out there, and he lost his poise. … We need Draymond. He knows that. We’ve talked to him. He’s got to find a way to keep his poise and be out there for his teammates.” When Green’s five-game suspension for putting Gobert in a headlock, which at the time was the longest of his 12-year career, was announced, the league said the Warriors forward was guilty of “an unsportsmanlike and dangerous” action toward Gobert and that his “history of unsportsmanlike acts” had factored into the suspension’s length. That suspension cost Green more than $769,000 of his $22.3 million salary. Green, who was also tossed from the Warriors’ 118-110 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 11 for shoving Donovan Mitchell from behind during a transition play, is no stranger to league discipline. He was ejected from Game 2 and suspended for Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Sacramento Kings in April for  . As it did in its statement following the Gobert suspension, the NBA noted at the time the suspension was “based in part on Green’s history of unsportsmanlike acts.” Perhaps most famously,   below the belt during the 2016 NBA Finals, prompting a one-game suspension that helped swing the series in favor of the Cavaliers. In October 2022,   at practice. Poole was traded to the Washington Wizards in June, one week before the Warriors signed Green to a four-year, $100 million contract extension. The Warriors, who fell to 10-13 with the loss to the Suns, sit 11th in the Western Conference standings. Golden State’s next five games are at the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, home against the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, at the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday, home against the Boston Celtics on Tuesday and home against the Wizards on Dec. 22.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/13/warriors-draymond-green-suspended-indefinitely/,Washington Post,2023-12-13 21:54:00,
"If you’re reading this, congratulations, you are a name, image and likeness (NIL) agent! Find a college athlete to represent. Hop on LinkedIn and mingle.

If you’re reading this, congratulations, you are a name, image and likeness (NIL) agent! Find a college athlete to represent. Hop on LinkedIn and mingle. Go crazy, if you want, because we’re right in the thick of  . There’s no time like the present to land a massive deal. Okay, depending on where you work — or, really, where your client plays — there are some rules. Most states, though not all, technically require you to register as an agent. But for the most part, that just means filling out a short form and sending a check, whether it’s $100 in New York, $200 in North Carolina or $1,500 in South Carolina. In Louisiana, you don’t have to pay a fee if you’re licensed to practice law in the state.  , the fee is $357 if you apply between July 1 of an odd-numbered year and June 30 of an even-numbered year, then $497 if you apply between July 1 of an even-numbered year and June 30 of an odd-numbered year. And a test? There are no required tests to show a baseline of knowledge about NIL contracts, the transfer portal or anything else the modern college athlete faces. It’s not all that different from getting ordained online to officiate your friend’s wedding. And wide-ranging enforcement? Basically, there is none. Good luck! “I have seen so many people call themselves NCAA certified even though the NCAA doesn’t certify NIL agents,” said Darren Heitner, a Florida-based sports and entertainment lawyer who specializes in NIL. “Everyone likes to say that NIL transactions and athletes finally getting their due is the wild, wild west. Well, if you want to talk about the wild west, it’s the agent piece that’s ground zero for that because so many of them are ignoring the actual laws. And in the past few years, I haven’t heard one story about a state’s attorney general or secretary of state coming down on an NIL agent for not being properly registered.” So something has to give, right? Horror stories about “agents” — trying to make a quick buck in the transfer portal or sign a contract that scores an exorbitant share of an athlete’s future earnings — are way too common. One former NIL director at a major school recalled an agent asking for 50 percent of the money a player would make from the donor-funded collective that supported the athletic department. A collective leader at an ACC school said he recently saw social media messages between a freshman football player and a sales rep for a major cable service provider, with the rep promising the player a lucrative deal if he leaped into the transfer portal with him. Shockingly, the cable rep had no searchable experience in sports. When the NCAA   to profit off their names, images and likenesses on July 1, 2021, tens of thousands of college students became potential clients for sports agents or “sports agents” overnight. It didn’t matter that no one knew how the market would work. What mattered was that a market existed at all. In the 2½ years since, a patchwork of quickly enacted state laws has created a complicated landscape. And what many can agree on is the need for more regulation — or any regulation — of NIL agents, especially considering how much money is being pumped into revenue sports by those  . While schools and collectives can try to screen who represents their athletes, most states don’t require NIL agents to disclose their relationships or contracts with clients. Unlike in major professional leagues, there’s also no players association to standardize the requirements to be an agent, nor is there a collective bargaining agreement because college athletes are not considered employees (yet). The NCAA does have a certification process for agents looking to represent athletes ahead of the NBA draft. As for NIL specifically, the NCAA has  , allowing athletes to view them in a centralized place and rate their experience for others to see. This is a small sliver of a larger proposal for student-athlete NIL protection that will be voted on in January. “The qualifications for being an NIL agent are the same as being a quote-unquote NFL draft expert,” said Neil Stratton, founder of Inside the League, which offers services to NFL scouts, agents and players preparing for the draft. “You declare yourself one.” That’s not to say every NIL agent is a rogue actor. Far from it, actually. Major agencies such as CAA, WME and Excel, among others, now have NIL wings. Many people with backgrounds in marketing or branding have registered through the proper channels and educated themselves on the space. Or take Jack Adler, a recent Syracuse graduate who started as an NIL agent while in school, then grew his company, Out2Win Sports, into a legitimate sports marketing firm with a long list of clients. But that still leads to another question: What might more regulation even look like? Among its many functions, Stratton’s company helps aspiring NFL agents prep for a tough entry exam. It costs $2,500 for two cracks at the test. Stratton estimated a 20 to 30 percent chance of passing the first time, then around 50 percent the second. Along the way, there’s an extensive background check. For those who pass, it costs $2,500 more to officially register. Then they have three years to sign a player on a 90-man roster — the bloated size after the draft each spring — or their license is revoked. Tom Livolsi, founder of Savage Wolves, a collective supporting North Carolina State athletics, has started an NIL compliance company that plans to have a certified agent program that universities would have to buy into. Other ideas include an official agent database (similar to the NCAA’s idea) and forcing agents to disclose when they are not registered with an “athletic association” such as the NCAA or a conference, something Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) proposed in his October draft for a federal bill to standardize NIL rights. But again, determining who would enforce these measures — and how they would enforce them — remains a puzzle. “At the very least, there should be a test that forces people to study up on contracts and NCAA regulations before becoming an NIL agent,” said Adler, who has continued building Out2Win after graduating this past spring. “It wouldn’t fix everything, but it couldn’t hurt.” Which leads to a final question (though there certainly are more): Is a democratized agent landscape all bad? Adler is an NIL success story, showing how the market can benefit athletes  enterprising students who might want to work in sports after graduating. To land the first NIL deal for a Syracuse football captain in 2021, Adler put on a suit and walked from one business to the next, eventually landing a partnership with a local gym. He was 20 years old. He had a law student look over any contracts before his athletes signed. And when Out2Win grew beyond New York, Adler had the agents he hired register in each state in which they represented athletes. He sees NIL as a way for students to carve out their own internships during the school year. And his path, starting with squinting at contracts in his dorm room, hasn’t clouded his view of what should happen next. He wants you to be an NIL agent if that’s your dream, same as it was his. He just sees a pressing need for some sort of process to becoming one. He wishes you luck, too. “It’s great that anyone, at any age, can work in this industry,” Adler said. “But for the safety of the athletes and NIL long term, putting in actual work has to be a big part of that.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/15/nil-unregulated-agents/,Washington Post,2023-12-15 08:30:00,

In 48 starts, he had eight assists and four goals, including United’s last of the 2023 season during a 2-0 victory over New York City FC on Oct. 7. Durkin’s departure frees up $200,000 in salary cap space. He earned $481,250 this year — 11th highest on the 31-man squad — but because of his roster classification, less than half of it applied to the cap. The money received in the trade will provide additional flexibility as Mackay pursues several other moves in the coming weeks. The 6-foot-3 Bartlett made his MLS debut this season, starting 12 matches for expansion St. Louis. Previously, he played for FC Dallas’s developmental squad following an NCAA career at Loyola Chicago, Drake and St. John’s. Bartlett, 26, will add badly needed depth to United’s central defense. The team did not exercise the contract option on Brendan Hines-Ike (41 starts in three years) and didn’t offer a new package to Derrick Williams (21 starts this season). Donovan Pines (77 starts in five seasons) is a free agent who seems more likely to test the MLS market or head overseas than strike a new deal with United. The only contracted center backs are captain Steven Birnbaum, 17-year-old Matai Akinmboni (five career appearances) and 21-year-old Hayden Sargis (two). Stroud, 27, was in the New York Red Bulls’ system from 2015 through 2020 before being selected by Austin FC in the expansion draft. After two seasons there, he was traded to St. Louis, where he recorded five goals and five assists in 31 appearances (25 starts) for a team that finished first in the Western Conference standings. A Colgate graduate, Stroud will add flank depth after   with several wings and wing backs last week. The trade comes as Mackay bolstered his staff by adding Caleb Shreve as assistant general manager and Clarens Cheridieu as director of player personnel. Shreve was head of analytics for Orlando City for two years after working alongside Mackay as a data analyst with Nashville SC. Cheridieu was assistant GM of Loudoun United, the second-division club that is part-owned by D.C. United. With Shreve and Cheridieu’s assistance, Mackay is leading the search for a head coach. Several former MLS coaches are on the broad list, people familiar with United’s plans said. That group has included Robin Fraser (Colorado), Caleb Porter (Portland, Columbus), Bruce Arena (D.C., Red Bulls, L.A. Galaxy, New England), Giovanni Savarese (Portland) and Domènec Torrent (NYCFC). New to the mix are Troy Lesense, who coached the Red Bulls this season, and U.S. men’s national team assistant B.J. Callaghan, one person said. Mackay said recently he hopes to make an offer by Christmas. Training camp is scheduled to open in mid-January.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/08/dc-united-trade-chris-durkin/,Washington Post,2023-12-08 12:01:00,

Nearly a month had passed since Israel began attacks in Gaza after the killing and kidnapping of Israelis by Hamas militants, and Torres, the longtime executive director of CASA, a consequential immigrant rights group based in Maryland, felt moved to weigh in. He, too, had endured violence, in Colombia, his native country. So on Nov. 6, he called for an immediate cease-fire to “halt the systematic ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people” alongside protest photos uploaded to CASA’s accounts. He condemned the use of U.S. tax dollars to “promote the ongoing violence,” and offered his strong support of “the rights of Indigenous peoples and historically colonized nations to reclaim their land.” For Torres, the statement of fewer than 260 words was a call for peace. But in the politically powerful D.C. suburb of Montgomery County, home to Maryland’s largest Jewish population — it has created anything but. Within an hour, Torres said, his words came down, but the fallout continued. In the days that followed, a major donor pulled its funding and lawmakers questioned the group’s political activity. Some even called to defund it. The organization, lauded for decades as a champion for the rights of the disenfranchised, now finds itself embroiled in a public, personal fight for its future. Torres was initially taken aback by the uproar, he said, and questioned how words that spoke for peace and humanity caused pain. “We said, what is wrong with this?” he recalled in a recent interview. But as public call-outs escalated, he began making his apologies in private. “Our friends call us and say, ‘Gustavo … Let me tell you what the language means for us, how that is wrong, if you allow me to educate you.’ And we realized that was clearly, clearly wrong language.” In numerous private conversations, which he declined to detail, he listened to several people, many of whom he considered friends, identify the lines and words that had caused harm. And he worried about what the fallout could mean for all the good he still hoped to do at the organization he has led for nearly 30 years. Shouldn’t the work he and his colleagues have done providing English classes and connecting people with jobs, health care and vaccinations count for more than one mistake? “I made that statement and, yes, I made a mistake,” Torres said. “Now, they say that they are going to cut our funding. I feel really sad.” When Torres became director of the group in 1994, it had a budget of less than $500,000 and operated out of a church basement. Now, it’s a multimillion-dollar operation running out of a historic mansion in Langley Park, with branch offices in York, Pa., northern Virginia and Georgia. It expanded alongside a rising and diversifying immigrant population in Maryland’s D.C. suburbs, focusing initially on obtaining driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants. The left-leaning group has also become known for its advocacy. It has joined other progressive groups in fights for policing reform, access to health care and an expansion of tax credits for the working poor. With Torres at the helm, CASA has successfully fought in Maryland for in-state college tuition for undocumented students, to prohibit local jails from housing detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and to keep police from asking people about their immigration status during traffic stops and investigations. The group’s members, clad in red T-shirts, have become a staple in Annapolis and on the National Mall. To help pay for the services CASA provides, members pay dues and the organization has built relationships with state and local governments, which cover about a third of its annual funding. The rest largely comes from philanthropic partners, including foundations and corporations. Among them is the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, which has given CASA $5 million over 16 years, including capital grants for two buildings that bear the name of the foundation’s founders. Days after the posts, foundation officials met with Torres and members of his senior team and told him how deeply disturbed they were by the statement. Subsequently, they learned about one of the photos that accompanied Torres’s statement on social media. In it, a protester held a sign that read “from the river to the sea,” words that, foundation officials said, “call for the elimination of the State of Israel and the removal of its Jewish citizens.” ( .) It was “indefensible,” they said. The foundation cut its remaining $150,000 grant for the 2024 budget and plans to redirect it to another nonprofit committed to serving refugees and asylum seekers in Maryland. It also decided to remove Harry and Jeanette Weinberg’s names from the two CASA buildings that the foundation helped fund and said it would pay for the costs associated with removing the signage. Through a spokesperson, the Weinbergs declined to comment. Torres in an interview thanked the foundation for its support and said he understands and respects its decision. But the losses were piling up. Suddenly, a man who for so long had been seen as an advocate for human rights, who had himself fled violence and political persecution in his native Colombia, was the target of public condemnations and private calls for his ouster. With the posts, Torres inserted CASA into what has become an increasingly bitter debate that has played out across college campuses, on social media and among Democratic voters over the conflict and the U.S. response to it.   has come   from liberal members of his party for the administration’s support for the Israeli military operation. And as the war continues,   show a splintering in the party, with young voters and  increasingly   with Palestinians. CASA’s statement struck a softer tone than other recent public statements in Maryland that have elicited public condemnation. The Maryland attorney general on Tuesday   Zainab Chaudry, the director of the Maryland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, from her seat on the state’s Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention  . In one, Chaudry directly compared Israel to Nazi Germany — a juxtaposition that is widely seen as antisemitic — with the caption “That moment when you become what you hated most.” “There are very chilling parallels between what we see occurring in Gaza with other very disturbing, terrifying moments in our world’s history,” Chaudry told The Washington Post in an interview about her posts. She said that she is using her personal social media account to express support for Palestinians who are suffering through attacks and a growing humanitarian crisis, and to recognize the pain of Palestinian Americans who live in Maryland, but that she also condemns attacks on Israeli civilians. Johns Hopkins Medicine placed Darren Klugman, a doctor and medical school professor, on leave following a series of vitriolic anti-Palestinian social media posts. Klugman’s account on X, formerly known as Twitter, has since been deleted, but screenshots still circulating online show posts referring to Palestinian people as “animals,” opposing humanitarian aid from the United Nations and supporting the “massacre” of people living in Gaza. Kim Hoppe, vice president of communications for Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that Klugman’s posts were “deeply disturbing” and that the doctor had been placed on leave pending a thorough investigation to determine whether he had violated any policies. Klugman did not immediately return a request for comment. The discourse occurs against a backdrop of increased incidents of antisemitism in Maryland  . Montgomery County Council Vice President Andrew Friedson (D) said the statement from Torres showed a “divisive disregard” for the Jewish community in Maryland, which experienced nearly a doubling of reported antisemitic incidents between 2020 and 2021. He wrote in a response to Torres that, by denying Jews’ historical connections to the region that includes Israel and not recognizing Jews of color, “CASA inexplicably failed to recognize the connection so many Jews have to CASA’s mission and to their own homeland as a people who have been systematically persecuted and forced to flee countless countries for over 2,000 years.” After receiving calls from constituents, the Montgomery County delegation to Maryland’s state Senate told Torres in a statement that his words were “hurtful, divisive and antisemitic.” Sen. Benjamin F. Kramer (D-Montgomery), who chairs the delegation and helped craft the letter, said Torres displayed “a complete and total lack of understanding and knowledge of the complexities of the Middle East, the history of the Middle East, the history of both the Jewish people and antisemitism in its myriad forms.” Kramer said he was disheartened that there was no recognition of the Jewish people in the statement and that Israel was characterized as the aggressor. (One sentence in Torres’s statement condemned the “outrageous attack by   in Israel. Our hearts go out to the innocent children and families caught in the midst of this horrendous conflict.”) Two days after Torres’s post, Kramer and his colleagues threatened CASA with the possibility of losing its state funding in the letter. The services it provides could be offered by organizations other than CASA, he said in an interview, adding the group should search its soul for whether it wants to stick to its mission or “start participating in world politics on issues that they clearly have no understanding about.” Torres was a college student and union organizer when he fled Colombia in the late 1980s, facing threats on his life. He said he had no idea that the words on the photo promoted Jewish hate. “When I received the call from our friends, I said, ‘WHAT?!’” Torres explained. “That’s why we immediately took it down.” The senators’ letter prompted groups to come to CASA’s defense. The ACLU of Maryland wrote a letter objecting to the senators’ threat to scrutinize and possibly cut CASA’s funding, citing the First Amendment. Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery), an immigrant, said he would “fight any attempt by any Democrat in Annapolis to target resources for new Americans.” And several progressive activists, including a group of Maryland Jews, wrote an   supporting CASA. Supporters also placed calls to lawmakers, senators said. Instead of shining a spotlight directly on the innocent Israeli and Palestinian children and families caught in the midst of this horrendous conflict, we caused dear friends and partners pain and confusion. Read CASA’s full statement     Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Chairman William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), who signed the Senate delegation letter, said Monday that he supports free speech “but I also believe racially, culturally and religiously insensitive speech should be called out, even amongst friends.” He said that Torres’s words undermined the mission of CASA but that his apology should be enough for everyone to move on. Ten days after posting the first statement, Torres finalized another that captured the results of his listening tour and went through about 40 sets of eyes before it was released late last week. He hopes it will be enough. In the apology, Torres said his goal with the original statement was to “shine a spotlight directly on the innocent Israeli and Palestinian children and families caught in the midst of this horrendous conflict.” He said he failed. “Our message was flawed, diminishing of Israeli people, hurtful to many of our Jewish allies, and counter to our goals of advancing peace. For that, I am sorry,” the statement reads, in part. Kramer said he personally accepts Torres’s apology  describing it as a “good first step with more work to come.” He found it sincere. The two spoke Monday night, four days after CASA’s second post. Kramer asked Torres pointedly whether the apology was rooted in the blowback or an acknowledgment of the harm that was done. “He unequivocally said the apology comes as a response to the harm that we did and the misinformation that he stated,” he said. It remains unclear what the fallout will be. “The movie’s not finished yet, so we don’t know exactly how it is going to end,” Kramer said. The conflict erupted as CASA had decided to elevate its voice on international issues, with the creation of an international solidarity committee. It will deal with world issues that impact “our families and our communities,” said Torres, who plans to implement internal training on antisemitic, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias. The first session, on antisemitism, is scheduled for next week.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/22/casa-maryland-israel-gaza-gustavo-torres/,Washington Post,2023-11-22 17:57:00,

Republican polling leader   incorrectly said a U.S. soldier died in recent days, appearing to exaggerate the injuries from an attack in northern Iraq on Monday as he sought to criticize  .  left one U.S. service member in critical condition and two others injured, according to a statement released by U.S. military officials Monday night. The United States responded with retaliatory airstrikes against an Iran-backed armed group. But the former president, who is a heavy favorite in the 2024 GOP primary, inaccurately described the situation in an interview Wednesday with pro-Trump journalist John Solomon. “Last night, a young soldier was killed, U.S., and the two were very, very badly hurt and nobody even talks about it,” Trump said, describing the assault two nights prior. “It’s not even believable.” Both the U.S. military and National Security Council released statements on the attack Monday. A Trump campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to requests to clarify his remarks. The comments are part of a broader pattern of Trump frequently embellishing or otherwise misstating the number of U.S. military casualties as he seeks to make himself look more favorable compared with Biden. He routinely claims in campaign speeches that U.S. forces in Afghanistan went 18 months without any fatalities during his presidency. The Defense Casualty Analysis System’s Sentinel database has recorded U.S. military hostile deaths every year of the conflict since 2015. U.S. Central Command attributed the attack to Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed armed group that has claimed dozens of attacks with one-way attack drones and rockets on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria since the   began in October. The Biden administration has responded with airstrikes on a handful of occasions, including on Monday evening in Iraq. “These strikes are intended to hold accountable those elements directly responsible for attacks on coalition forces in Iraq and Syria and degrade their ability to continue attacks,” said Gen. Michael “Erik” Kurilla, chief of Central Command, in the statement Monday. The continuing attacks have raised continued questions about whether the Biden administration is doing enough to deter the militias and the Houthis, another Iran-backed group in Yemen. The Houthis repeatedly have launched one-way attack drones and ballistic missiles at vessels in the Red Sea, damaging a few of them. Administration officials have said they will respond to the attacks in a manner and at a time of their choosing, while also balancing a desire to prevent the war in Gaza from becoming a regional conflict. In the interview, Trump falsely claimed that the attacks had gone completely unanswered. “We don’t even do anything about it,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/27/trump-iraq-false-statement/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 20:18:00,
"ANAHEIM, Calif. — Brett Leason scored twice for the first time in his NHL career, Jamie Drysdale put in his first goal in nearly 21 months and the Anaheim Ducks used a four-goal first period to propel them to a 5-2 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights on Wednesday night. “I thought we started strong. As a line and individual we were playing fast, shooting pucks and getting lots of chances,” said Leason, who has six goals and 11 points this season. ANAHEIM, Calif. — Brett Leason scored twice for the first time in his NHL career, Jamie Drysdale put in his first goal in nearly 21 months and the Anaheim Ducks used a four-goal first period to propel them to a 5-2 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights on Wednesday night. “I thought we started strong. As a line and individual we were playing fast, shooting pucks and getting lots of chances,” said Leason, who has six goals and 11 points this season. Frank Vatrano and Troy Terry also had goals for Anaheim, which found the back of the net four times in the opening 12 minutes. It was the 16th time in franchise history they have scored at least four times in the first period and the first since March 16, 2021, against Colorado. Mason McTavish had three assists, Cam Fowler had two and John Gibson stopped 30 shots. Alec Martinez and Mark Stone scored for the Golden Knights, who have dropped four straight. Logan Thompson made 21 saves. “I just don’t think we were ready to play, myself included. Too many breakdowns, not good enough gaps,” Martinez said. “They’re a real offensive team, good on the rush, we gave them too many opportunities, but also credit to them, they buried on it.” Leason opened the scoring at 3:23 of the first period with a redirect of Cam Fowler’s shot from the blue line. Leason then put in a rebound at 17:45 of the second to put the Ducks up by three goals. Drysdale, the sixth overall pick in the 2020 NHL draft, got the puck just inside the right faceoff circle and ripped a snap shot past Thompson 8:23 into the first period to give the Ducks a 2-0 advantage. The 21-year old defenseman missed most of last season due to a torn labrum in his left shoulder and was out for the first 29 games this season due to an upper-body injury. “It’s obviously nice to get on the board, but it’s also nice to get a win here against a team like that, especially at home, where we’ve been struggling a little bit,” Drysdale said. The Ducks had 11 players with a point in the opening 20 minutes. The four-goal onslaught included a pair within 40 seconds. Vatrano had a one-timer at 11:38 for his team-leading 16th goal of the season and Terry followed with a wrist shot that went between Thompson’s legs at 12:18 for his ninth. “It’s tough for them. The fly in this morning and have to play a game and guys were probably spread all over the place for the holiday. I’ve always said that the home team has an advantage on these games after a break. We had energy and we were buzzing,” Ducks coach Greg Cronin said. After Martinez’s fourth goal of the season at 7:23 of the second period, Stone extended his point streak to five games with a power-play goal at 12:34. Stone has two goals and seven points during that span. “We didn’t start on time today as well as we could have, yet we generated five or six chances as well. It wasn’t a one-sided first period by any means, theirs went in, ours didn’t,” Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. UP NEXT Golden Knights: Host the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday.

"The Baltimore Orioles’ Brandon Hyde and the Miami Marlins’ Skip Schumaker were named MLB’s managers of the year Tuesday after a vote by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. Each directed his team to a surprisingly successful season, Hyde by leading his Orioles to the best record in the American League and Schumaker by leading his Marlins to a National League playoff berth. The Baltimore Orioles’ Brandon Hyde and the Miami Marlins’ Skip Schumaker were named MLB’s managers of the year Tuesday after a vote by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. Each directed his team to a surprisingly successful season, Hyde by leading his Orioles to the best record in the American League and Schumaker by leading his Marlins to a National League playoff berth. Hyde made a compelling case for the award in 2022, when he managed the Orioles to 83 wins a year before anyone, including some of his team’s architects, expected them to contend. Baltimore’s transformation into the AL East champion pushed Hyde to the top of the list this year. The 50-year-old was hired at the start of the Orioles’ latest rebuild and oversaw three losing seasons before watching his young team mature into a winner. He ushered in franchise building blocks Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson,  , and helped the next generation of Orioles stars take charge in a clubhouse peppered with players whose jobs the younger players would be taking if the whole thing went to plan. “During those [rebuilding] years, I had confidence we were going to turn this thing around. But you struggle to see the light at the end of the tunnel, honestly,” Hyde said Tuesday. “... To come as far as we have, it’s a lot of homegrown guys and guys we’ve developed at the big league level. You feel good about that.” FanGraphs projected the Orioles to go 80-82 in 2023. Baseball Prospectus’s PECOTA formula suggested 74-88. Baltimore finished 101-61. The Orioles were not swept in the regular season, which is the period on which BBWAA voting is based. It wasn’t until the AL Division Series that Bruce Bochy’s eventual   handed the Orioles  . “I’m just proud of what we’ve accomplished up until this point,” Hyde said. “... I thought we had a really special season. To win 101 games in the big leagues is really hard to do.” Hyde received 27 of 30 first-place votes. The other three went to runner-up Bochy. The Tampa Bay Rays’ Kevin Cash finished third  . “Those two guys that were up there with me I have so much respect for,” Hyde said. “Kevin Cash is a great manager and has been really good for a long time and is going to continue to be for a long time. Bruce Bochy is Hall of Famer and someone I look up to and hope to be like some day.” Schumaker, a rookie skipper, was voted the NL’s top manager after he helped the Marlins make the postseason in a 162-game season for the first time in 20 years. Schumaker credited his former St. Louis Cardinals manager, Tony La Russa, for teaching him how to create a winning culture. “This is a staff award. ... I just believe the staff around me created this culture,” said Schumaker, who was the Cardinals’ bench coach in 2022 after a stint as a San Diego Padres assistant. “… I’m super grateful to be next to those two managers who were up for that award.” Schumaker, 43, landed  . Runner-up Craig Counsell, then with the Milwaukee Brewers  , received five, and the Atlanta Braves’ Brian Snitker also claimed eight first-place votes but had less down-ballot support than Schumaker. The Marlins posted a negative run differential (minus-57) over an 84-win season but secured a wild-card berth before falling to the Philadelphia Phillies in the opening round. Schumaker’s offseason has been far more turbulent. The general manager who hired him, Kim Ng,   after owner Bruce Sherman suggested the Marlins would hire a head of baseball operations above her. Miami has since picked former Rays general manager Peter Bendix to lead its baseball operations. “I think we set a new standard in that clubhouse, and now it’s time to protect that standard,” Schumaker said. “I just felt like the culture kind of changed and they knew what winning looked like. Credit to my incredible staff.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/14/brandon-hyde-skip-schumaker-mlb-managers-year/,Washington Post,2023-11-14 19:45:00,

On their own, they stand as all-time great players still under 30. Together, as rivals and allies, they encapsulate every dimension of a sport stepping into its power. Some superstars are tasked with maintaining their league. Others are born into eras that necessitate the audacity to inspire movement. Wilson and Stewart recognize the moment.  . They hear the opportunity summoning them to step forward for the good of the league. They have elevated the WNBA with their talent, but that was the baseline expectation when they arrived as No. 1 draft picks adorned with collegiate honors and championships. Since then, they have grown beyond their preternatural skills and become the game’s most important personalities. They leverage themselves differently. Wilson is a whirlwind of energy and hilarity, a nonstop entertainer even when discussing weighty topics. Stewart exemplifies quiet intensity; when she chooses to raise her voice, it echoes. Combine their approaches, and they cover much of what the WNBA now represents: authenticity, empowerment, fearlessness, independence, style, culture, edge. The league is full of people who understand, better than most, the dexterity necessary to compete for and against each other. This dynamic makes the latest round of Wilson vs. Stewart so much richer than a stereotypical rivalry. On Sunday, as a dream WNBA Finals begins, the Las Vegas Aces and New York Liberty will meet in a best-of-five series featuring superteams that won at least 80 percent of their contests in the first year of the league’s 40-game schedule. But for Wilson and Stewart, this is wonderfully repetitive: For the third time in four seasons, their path to a championship goes through each other. During the 2020 bubble Finals, Stewart won her second title with the Seattle Storm,  . In the semifinals last season, Wilson led the Aces to a tightly contested 3-1 series victory over the Storm, ending   and closing Stewart’s time in Seattle. Then the Aces   in the 2022 Finals, sparking a Vegas-worthy celebratory binge from Wilson and her teammates. Looking back, the Aces won that championship because Wilson confronted herself after a lackluster Game 1 loss to Seattle. After winning her second MVP award in 2022, Wilson scored just eight points and missed seven of 10 shots in a 76-73 home loss. At that moment, Wilson had faced Stewart four times in the postseason, and her team had lost all four games. After being swept in 2020 and leaving the bubble, Wilson experienced panic attacks and sought therapy. She has since championed mental health advocacy. During her toughest time last season, she found her peace again. “I was hot,” Wilson recalled. “I was hot. I don’t think y’all understand how I felt after that game. That was just terrible by me. It ate me up. I didn’t sleep at night; that’s one time I didn’t sleep. I didn’t understand what was going on with me. I think I figured I just didn’t believe in myself. My confidence went away. And I’ve never seen that in A’ja — ever.” She averaged 30 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.3 blocks for the rest of the series, engaging in an epic duel with Stewart, who went for 31.3 points and 9.7 rebounds in those games. But Vegas won all three games, one in overtime and the others decided by five points each. The Storm’s reign was about to end. The Aces were no longer trying to break through. Wilson rose from being the greatest challenger to Stewart’s best-player-in-the-game status to a transcendent star who deserves a share of the label. “Coming in, I really wanted to establish myself in this league, and I try my best to do that every single game,” Wilson said. “After that game, I don’t know. I felt like I disrespected myself by not putting myself first, putting my mental [health] first. After that game, I took it very, very personal to understand and realize who I am.” It might be impossible for any player to supplant Stewart as the defining player of this era. She had such a storybook college career; as a professional, she has been a sublime player and voice for social justice and for better pay, travel and support in the WNBA. She fights against the league, and she fights for it. She honors tradition and looks to forge new paths. But she’s not a star who hogs all the oxygen. This sport has seen plenty of individual dominance. It needs a greater audience to respect its multiplicity. That’s where Stewart and Wilson signify a rivalry and a partnership, an intriguing matchup that they hope spreads attention throughout the league. “We’re at a special place in women’s basketball,” Stewart said. “There are so many great players doing so many great things every single night.” As with Magic Johnson and Larry Bird during the NBA’s ascension in the 1980s, it’s easier sometimes for one magnetic pair to connect everyone to the whole. For Wilson and Stewart, the stakes keep getting higher every time their teams meet. Las Vegas finished the regular season with a remarkable 34-6 record, and the Aces look to enter the conversation as one of the league’s greatest teams by becoming the first repeat champion in 21 years. Despite being a founding WNBA franchise, the Liberty has yet to win a championship in the league’s 27 seasons. But the Northeast homecoming of Stewart, a North Syracuse, N.Y., native who played college basketball at Connecticut, has opened a new window of contention. She came back to New York as the most celebrated free agent acquisition in league history, and the Liberty formed a core that only the Aces can match by also signing star point guard Courtney Vandersloot and trading for 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones to partner with young superstar Sabrina Ionescu and Betnijah Laney, a 2021 all-star. With their balanced and explosive starting lineup, the Liberty finished 32-8, and they beat the Aces three times in five matchups if you include an 82-63 blowout in the Commissioner’s Cup final. Will Stewart win her third WNBA title and finally deliver a trophy to New York? Or will Wilson collect a second and pull even in the hardware race? “Someone’s making history,” Aces Coach Becky Hammon said. Instead of fake and forced hatred, Wilson and Stewart share a competitive bond. Although Wilson admitted she was “hurt” over not winning MVP this season, she doesn’t knock Stewart for capitalizing on the Big Apple hype. They strive together, two power forwards with the versatility to operate as positionless players. Stewart does it with skill and length, her 6-foot-4 frame stretching into a 7-foot-1 wingspan. At the same height, Wilson is more of an athletic post presence who continues to expand her game and raise her efficiency. She shot 55.7 percent this season, an unprecedented number for a WNBA forward who averaged 22.8 points, slightly behind Stewart’s 23.0. Both are defensive factors; Wilson is the two-time reigning defensive player of the year. The sport has never seen two evolutionary forwards meet so frequently for the championship. At the same time, they’re committed to anchoring Team USA for three more  .

"Mark W. Wright felt a great sense of pride when   the short film he produced for ESPN about the Howard men’s soccer team’s 1974 national championship, premiered at the school’s Cramton Auditorium  . But as Wright, a 1993 graduate of Howard, looked out at the audience that night and saw the faces of a few members of the Bison’s 1971 team whose title was vacated by the NCAA, he knew he wasn’t done telling their story. Mark W. Wright felt a great sense of pride when   the short film he produced for ESPN about the Howard men’s soccer team’s 1974 national championship, premiered at the school’s Cramton Auditorium  . But as Wright, a 1993 graduate of Howard, looked out at the audience that night and saw the faces of a few members of the Bison’s 1971 team whose title was vacated by the NCAA, he knew he wasn’t done telling their story. “This is America, right? We want to talk about winners, and we want to talk about falling down and getting back up and holding the trophy at the end of the day,” Wright said in a recent phone interview. “That film focused on [the 1974 team]. I felt that the ’71 group was getting side-barred, and I made a promise to a lot of those guys that I wasn’t going to put this story down until I did them justice.” Seven years later, Wright has made good on his vow. The 1971 Howard team that experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows under legendary coach Lincoln Phillips is the subject of Wright’s three-episode podcast   produced as part of Meadowlark Media’s “Sports Explains the World” series. It debuted earlier this month with the last of its episodes dropping Wednesday on Wondery Plus and on other podcast platforms. “The Bison Project” features interviews with several of the surviving members of the 1971 team, including lifelong friends Ian Bain and Alvin Henderson of Trinidad and Tobago, and former New York Times reporter Lena Williams, who was the first female editor of “the Hilltop,” Howard’s student newspaper. Williams covered Phillips’s squad in 1971 when it became the first historically Black college or university to win a Division I national title in any sport. Howard’s soccer team burst onto the national scene in 1970. After the Bison started 9-0, The Washington Post declared that Phillips and longtime coach Ted Chambers, who guided the program to an NAIA title in 1961, were “quietly building a soccer dynasty” that “might someday rival UCLA’s basketball success.” Howard lost to UCLA in its first trip to the NCAA semifinals that year, but it returned stronger than ever in 1971. Players credited Phillips, a former star goalkeeper for Trinidad and Tobago’s national team and player-manager for the North American Soccer League’s Washington Darts, for building unity on a team that included players from 10 countries. After an undefeated 1971 regular season, Howard defeated Harvard, 1-0, in the national semifinals. The Bison met defending national champion Saint Louis, which was riding a 24-match winning streak, in the title game. Howard prevailed, 3-2, at Miami’s Orange Bowl on Henderson’s second goal of the game, a blast into the upper left corner of the net off a pass from Stan Smith. “As far as I am concerned, this is the biggest achievement of my life,” Phillips told reporters afterward. At the start of the 1972 season, The Post reported that the NCAA was investigating Howard for potentially using ineligible players. Keith Aqui, the Bison’s best player and a focus of the investigation related to his amateur soccer career in Trinidad and Tobago, was sidelined indefinitely. The Bison enjoyed another dominant regular season and advanced to the national semifinals anyway, but had their 30-game winning streak snapped in a 2-1 overtime loss to Saint Louis. Aqui and Tony Martin had already been declared ineligible for the game because they had played too many years of soccer in Trinidad and Tobago after turning 19. Howard athletic director Leo Miles withheld two other starters, Mori Diane and Keith Look Loy, after meeting with the NCAA rules infractions committee 10 days earlier. “It’s pretty evident that a Black school isn’t supposed to win,” Phillips said afterward. “Once we start winning, it’s considered unfair, we’re cheating somehow and things have to be righted.” Phillips echoed those sentiments at a banquet the following night, with NCAA officials in attendance. “I would say that the NCAA is guilty of practicing racism,” he said. “Saint Louis did not beat Howard University last night. They beat the remnants of what was left of Howard University.” The news came via telegram a couple weeks later, on Jan. 9, 1973: The NCAA was placing Howard on one-year probation and stripping it of its 1971 national title. The investigation alleged Aqui and Rick Yallery-Arthur had exhausted their five years of eligibility before the 1971 season by playing in Trinidad and Tobago, and that Martin and Guinean forward Mori Diane had failed to take the SAT or ACT. Diane and Howard filed suit in U.S. District Court, claiming the NCAA’s ruling was unconstitutional. A judge acknowledged the NCAA’s rules were vague and overly complex, but did not find the enforcement of those rules discriminatory. Meanwhile, Saint Louis Coach Harry Keough declined to accept the Bison’s vacated trophy. “There were Black players sprinkled on the best teams of the day in college soccer,” Wright, who never received a response from the NCAA in the course of reporting his podcast, said. “[Howard was] the only school with an all-Black team and a Black coach. … Did Howard unintentionally break some rules? Yes, I don’t think we hide from that. Intentionally? I would say no.” Born in England and raised in Jamaica before moving to the D.C. area as a 12-year-old, Wright has a personal connection to this story beyond his Howard degree. Bain, one of three players on the 1971 team who was also on the team that won the 1974 title, was later hired to coach soccer and teach Spanish at Springbrook High School, which Wright attended. Wright joined Springbrook’s soccer team as a senior, and Bain became a lifelong mentor. In “The Bison Project,” Wright gives Bain and his teammates their flowers, and the opportunity to speak their truth about the pain that followed a joyous season. “He would never say on the record that he wanted those flowers, but I know he appreciates it,” Wright said. “I still get text messages from a lot of the players, and they’re just super grateful that they can share the story with their kids and their grandkids.” Bain and Henderson recall playing soccer as kids in Trinidad and Tobago, and their difficulties assimilating to American college life as freshmen at Howard in the podcast, which is narrated by Wright and Sam Dingman. Williams, the Hilltop reporter, describes the “out of body experience” watching the Bison win the title in 1971 as Sly & The Family Stone’s   — the team’s unofficial anthem — blared on the pitch, and her dismay at seeing a team of immigrants get labeled as cheats after the NCAA’s ruling. One of the more interesting off-the-field stories Wright explores in the podcast concerns Howard’s lack of a White House visit with President Richard M. Nixon after winning the title. (His research took him to the Nixon Library and included interviews with Nixon’s former Cabinet members.) Wright has written to Vice President Harris, a fellow Howard graduate, about a potential future visit to the White House. He still holds out hope that the NCAA, which has since amended the rules it penalized Howard for violating, might reconsider the Bison’s case. “If they come back with the same conclusion, I won’t be happy, but at least they’ll have taken a second look,” Wright said. “And how great would it be [for the 1971 team] to go to the White House? It would be amazing for them to be recognized with a visit, whether the trophy is with them or not. All I want is something like that for these guys.” A caption with a previous version of this article, for a photo of members of the 1971 Howard University men’s soccer team, omitted the name of Tony Martin. The caption has been corrected. ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/08/bison-project-howard-university-soccer-champion/,Washington Post,2023-11-11 19:34:00,
"ATLANTA — As he directed Howard to its first bowl appearance in nearly three decades and a shot at the Black college football national championship, quarterback Quinton Williams was so conscientious about ball security that he threw just four interceptions on 298 pass attempts. But the graduate student, a four-year starter, nearly matched that total in an uncharacteristically bumpy performance Saturday, and the defense broke down at inopportune stretches of the fourth quarter to leave the Bison with a 30-26 loss to Florida A&M in the Celebration Bowl. ATLANTA — As he directed Howard to its first bowl appearance in nearly three decades and a shot at the Black college football national championship, quarterback Quinton Williams was so conscientious about ball security that he threw just four interceptions on 298 pass attempts. But the graduate student, a four-year starter, nearly matched that total in an uncharacteristically bumpy performance Saturday, and the defense broke down at inopportune stretches of the fourth quarter to leave the Bison with a 30-26 loss to Florida A&M in the Celebration Bowl. Williams’s third and final interception with 1:45 left essentially ended any aspirations of a comeback in front of a Mercedes-Benz Stadium crowd of 41,108 that included Vice President Harris, a Howard alum. Williams’s pass was intended for Jarett Hunter, but the running back fell, allowing Rattlers linebacker Isaiah Major to snare the ball at the Howard 19-yard line. Florida A&M (12-1), the Southwestern Athletic Conference champion that entered on a 10-game winning streak, had grabbed the lead on Jeremy Moussa’s 38-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jah’Marae Sheread with 5:46 to play. Sheread got behind Howard defensive back Carson Hinton, whose 27-yard pick-six on the previous possession had given the Bison, the champions of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, their last lead of the game. “You can’t win many games when you turn the ball over three times,” said Williams, who played high school football at Wise. “That’s on me.” In its debut at the Celebration Bowl, which matches the winners of the premier football conferences featuring historically Black colleges and universities, Howard (6-6) fell short of its first winning season since it finished 7-4 in 2017. Williams completed 14 of 27 attempts for 106 yards as the Bison amassed just 187 yards. The Rattlers had 357. For Florida A&M, Moussa finished 19 for 32 for 289 yards and three touchdowns with two interceptions, and wide receiver Kelvin Dean Jr. (three catches for 87 yards and two touchdowns) was voted the game’s offensive most outstanding player. Major was voted the most outstanding player on defense. “It’s never fun to lose,” Howard Coach Larry Scott said. “Had opportunities, things that you lose football games with — some penalties, turnovers — especially in championship games. Those are things that bite you, so in the end [we] couldn’t do enough to overcome that.” The Bison gave up back-to-back touchdowns to fall behind 24-16 with 10:58 remaining. The second of those scores was Moussa’s 53-yard pass to Dean, who made the catch along the sideline and pulled away from safety Xavier Robiou. Howard trailed for the first time at 17-16 with 13:45 left after it surrendered an 83-yard drive that ended with Moussa’s 21-yard toss to Dean. Moussa’s pass sailed just over the head of linebacker Christian White and settled into Dean’s hands as he tumbled backward in the end zone. The first half ended with the Bison in front 16-10 thanks in part to Rattlers mistakes, including a holding penalty midway through the second quarter that erased a 31-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver Marcus Riley to Moussa, who was alone in the end zone on the gadget play. Florida A&M incurred 25 yards in penalties on that series, which ended when defensive end Ian White stepped in front of Moussa’s throw for an interception. Howard took over at its 49-yard line but gave the ball back when Williams threw into a crowd on fourth and 12 and was intercepted by Deco Wilson with 2:08 to go until halftime. The Rattlers scored the final points of the half on Cameron Gillis’s 41-yard field goal with 11 seconds to play. Earlier in the quarter, defensive end Darrian Brokenburr sacked Moussa in the end zone for the first safety in the eight-game history of the Celebration Bowl. The Bison were playing in their first bowl game since Dec. 31, 1996, when they rallied from a 14-point halftime deficit to beat Southern, 27-24, in the now-defunct Heritage Bowl at Atlanta’s Georgia Dome. This season, Howard secured a berth in the Celebration Bowl by beating Morgan State, 14-7, in the regular season finale at Greene Stadium. The triumph gave the Bison their second straight MEAC title. They finished with the same conference record as North Carolina Central but claimed the tiebreaker via a 50-20 win over the visiting Eagles on Nov 11. In its first game in nearly a month, Howard produced a rousing start with touchdowns on its first two possessions. The first came on Hunter’s eight-yard run through the middle with 13:29 to play in the opening quarter. The defense forced a turnover on Florida A&M’s first series when White strip-sacked Moussa for a loss of 17 yards. Hinton recovered, setting up the Bison at the Florida A&M 37-yard line. Wide receiver Kasey Hawthorne’s three-yard run bumped Howard’s lead to 14-0 less than five minutes in. “You never want to watch the other team celebrate,” said Hinton, a senior. “You want to be the one celebrating, but you know we’re definitely going to be back [and will] keep fighting. It’s not a loss — it’s a learning lesson.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/16/howard-famu-celebration-bowl/,Washington Post,2023-12-16 18:28:00,
"Giannis Antetokounmpo set a new career high for points in the Milwaukee Bucks’ 140-126 home win over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, but his determined quest to obtain the game ball sparked an extended postgame argument between the two teams that carried over into Fiserv Forum’s back hallways. The two-time NBA MVP poured in 64 points in 37 minutes, surpassing Milwaukee’s franchise record of 57 points, which was set by Michael Redd in 2006. Antetokounmpo also topped his previous career high of 55 points,  , and registered the first 60-point game by any NBA player this season. Giannis Antetokounmpo set a new career high for points in the Milwaukee Bucks’ 140-126 home win over the Indiana Pacers on Wednesday, but his determined quest to obtain the game ball sparked an extended postgame argument between the two teams that carried over into Fiserv Forum’s back hallways. The two-time NBA MVP poured in 64 points in 37 minutes, surpassing Milwaukee’s franchise record of 57 points, which was set by Michael Redd in 2006. Antetokounmpo also topped his previous career high of 55 points,  , and registered the first 60-point game by any NBA player this season. But the record-setting occasion ended in unusual fashion when the Pacers attempted to acquire the game ball for rookie forward Oscar Tshiebwe, who scored the first point of his career when he hit a free throw with 2:42 remaining. This prompted a furious reaction from Antetokounmpo, who confronted members of the Pacers on the court and briefly had to be restrained by Bucks employees. Antetokounmpo later sprinted toward the tunnel in an effort to track down the ball. A confrontation ensued between members of the Bucks and Pacers in the back hallway, and Antetokounmpo returned to the court to exchange more words with   and assistant coach Lloyd Pierce. A ball was eventually acquired for Antetokounmpo, though he questioned its authenticity. “I have a ball, but I don’t know if it’s the game ball,”  . “It doesn’t feel like the game ball to me. It feels like a brand new ball. I can tell — I played, what, 35 minutes today. I know how the game ball felt. The ball that I have, which I’ll take and give to my mom, for sure, I don’t know if it’s actually the game ball. It’s okay. Life will continue. ... I’ve never seen this [situation] before. I knew [the Pacers] had the game ball. I don’t know how it works, but I assume I can’t just walk into any arena and just take the ball.” Coaches and players regularly secure the game ball as a memento of a milestone, a debut or an otherwise noteworthy performance. In recent years, teams have taken to sharing video of the postgame presentation of a game ball to a player or coach on social media to further celebrate accomplishments. Typically, each NBA game has two balls: the main ball and an alternate. Pacers Coach Rick Carlisle confirmed that his team had attempted to collect the game ball for the 24-year-old Tshiebwe, who was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, spent a four-year college career at West Virginia and Kentucky and then signed a two-way contract with Indiana this past summer after going undrafted. While Tshiebwe played for the Pacers and scored one point in   against the Los Angeles Lakers, stats from that game did not count. Wednesday’s game against the Bucks therefore represented Tshiebwe’s official debut. “It was Oscar Tshiebwe’s first official NBA point, so we always get the game ball,”  . “We were not thinking about Giannis’s franchise record, so we grabbed the ball. A couple of minutes later, several of their players ended up in our hallway and there was a big — I don’t know what to call it — a fracas or melee or whatever. I don’t think any punches were landed, but my general manager [Chad Buchanan] got elbowed in the ribs by one of their players. He certainly has a bruised rib, and who knows if it’s anything more than that. Unfortunate situation.” The Bucks entered Wednesday seeking revenge for their loss to the Pacers in  , which saw Haliburton co-opt Damian Lillard’s “Dame Time” celebration. After the game, Lillard said Haliburton needed to “be humble.” Carlisle acknowledged there was “heated competition” during the third meeting between the Central Division rivals in a little more than a month. Milwaukee initially pulled Antetokounmpo from the game with a 19-point lead with 3:24 remaining, but Indiana’s bench players went on a 9-0 run to force Bucks Coach Adrian Griffin to put Antetokounmpo back in the game with 2:04 remaining. Antetokounmpo, who had 58 points when he was pulled initially, then played the rest of the way and added on six more points, including a dunk with 26 seconds left that pushed Milwaukee’s lead back to 16 points. The seven-time all-star shot 20 for 28 from the field, 0 for 3 from three-point range and 24 for 32 from the free throw line to set his new career high, adding 14 rebounds, three assists and four steals while finishing plus-29 as Milwaukee improved to 17-7 on the season. To add another layer of intrigue,   appeared to show a Bucks security staffer receiving the ball that was used at the end of the game from one of the referees. It’s unclear whether the game ball was passed on to a member of the Pacers or whether Antetokounmpo was mistaken and the Pacers had taken the alternate ball for Tshiebwe. Antetokounmpo said he understood why Tshiebwe would want to commemorate his first point, but the Bucks star noted he had topped 60 points and Lillard had passed Kyle Korver for fifth place on the NBA’s all-time list of three-point field goals during Wednesday’s game. Both historic honors, Antetokounmpo suggested, should take precedence over Tshiebwe’s scoring debut. Regardless, the King Solomon-like scene triggered another regret for Antetokounmpo, who wished he had a memento from his signature performance: A   that clinched the Bucks’ first championship in 50 years and earned him Finals MVP honors. “I don’t even have the game ball [from Game 6],” he said. “It hurts me.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/14/giannis-antetokounmpo-game-ball-fight/,Washington Post,2023-12-14 06:47:00,
"Hugh Aynesworth, a journalist at the Dallas Morning News who took a lunch break to watch President John F. Kennedy visit the city in November 1963, and then wrote some of the most gripping firsthand accounts of JFK’s assassination and the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald as the suspected gunman, died Dec. 23 at his home in Dallas. He was 92. Hugh Aynesworth, a journalist at the Dallas Morning News who took a lunch break to watch President John F. Kennedy visit the city in November 1963, and then wrote some of the most gripping firsthand accounts of JFK’s assassination and the arrest of Lee Harvey Oswald as the suspected gunman, died Dec. 23 at his home in Dallas. He was 92. His family announced the death but gave no specific cause. He was treated last month for health problems related to an earlier stroke. Mr. Aynesworth’s more than six-decade career in journalism brought him awards and acclaim for investigations that included debunking claims by a self-proclaimed serial killer and probing the bloodshed of another,  . That early afternoon in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, had already cemented Mr. Aynesworth’s place in journalism. His first-person reportage, written with brevity and power, brought readers to the scenes of three moments seared into historical memory: the gunfire on Kennedy and his motorcade, the arrest of Oswald at a movie theater later that day, and the fatal shooting of Oswald on Nov. 24 by nightclub owner  . “I was less than a block away. The president had just passed, beaming and waving,” wrote Mr. Aynesworth, who covered aerospace and came to a spot on the edge of Dealey Plaza hoping to get a glimpse of the president and the first lady,  . “I heard the first shot. I looked immediately toward the president’s car and thought I saw his hair fly up … I ran toward the caravan,” the story continued. “There was a lot of confusion. Someone shouted, ‘I saw him up there,’ and pointed toward the Texas School Depository building.” Mr. Aynesworth stayed near a police radio. He knew the prime suspect was Oswald, a School Book Depository employee who had just fatally shot a police officer, witnesses said. Mr. Aynesworth heard the tip that a man believed to be Oswald had ducked into the Texas Theatre, about three miles from Dealey Plaza. The movie playing was “War Is Hell.” Mr. Aynesworth rushed to the scene along with police. “People kept yelling, ‘Kill him.’ I heard Oswald say, ‘I resent this police brutality,’” Mr. Aynesworth wrote, “and then the police clamped hands over his mouth.” Two days later, as Oswald was being led from the police station en route to a county jail, Mr. Aynesworth was in the basement when Ruby leaped forward and fired a .38-caliber bullet into Oswald’s stomach. Oswald was pronounced dead at the same hospital where Kennedy was taken. (In a coincidence, Mr. Aynesworth had sat next to Ruby in the Dallas Morning News cafeteria shortly before Kennedy’s slaying when Ruby came to the newspaper to place an ad for his nightclub, the Carousel Club.) “I almost tear up sometimes when I think about what happened, and the feeling and the gut wrenching, not knowing what to do,” Mr. Aynesworth wrote in his 2003  , “JFK: Breaking the News,” co-written by journalist Stephen G. Michaud. “But it was so stark and so brutal. A beautiful day just turned into chaos.” Mr. Aynesworth made himself more than a witness to history. He probed the various   linked to the Kennedy assassination — and knocked them down one by one. Mr. Aynesworth supported the   conclusion that Oswald was the lone gunman. The suggestions that others pulled the strings — organized crime or the Soviet Union, or any other claim — never amounted to anything more than colorful conjecture, Mr. Aynesworth repeatedly noted. Mr. Aynesworth meticulously traced Oswald’s past and his escape route after the shooting. Mr. Aynesworth dug into Oswald’s previous trips to the Soviet Union. Instead of portraying Oswald as a potential conspiracy thread, Mr. Aynesworth depicted him as an unsteady man who didn’t fit into Soviet life and had to borrow money from his brother for airfare home. In story after story, Mr. Aynesworth took wrecking balls to conspiracy plots outlined by one of the most prominent skeptics of official accounts, New Orleans District Attorney  , who proposed ideas such as the CIA had organized the Kennedy assassination to keep the Vietnam War going. Mr. Aynesworth’s coverage and research into Garrison’s claims about the JFK killing ended up filling dozens of cabinets and storage bins in Mr. Aynesworth’s home. “You know, nothing would please me better than to find a conspiracy,” he   Texas Monthly in 1976. “The trouble is, in spite of its having some holes and having been put together too quickly, the Warren Commission Report still holds together.” The reality-check work, though, proved exhausting. Mr. Aynesworth spent hundreds of hours on various radio call-in shows and other programs, trying to cut through the fog concerning the JFK assassination. One time in the 1970s, someone asserted that he saw Oswald and Ruby together at a YMCA. “Well, I asked him which leg Ruby had the shark bite scar on, and he said, ‘The right one,’” Mr. Aynesworth recalled. “Ruby didn’t have any scars, much less from a shark.” Mr. Aynesworth later used his debunking skills on another story: claims by a convicted killer,  , that he was responsible for hundreds of other murders. Mr. Aynesworth and a colleague, Jim Henderson, wrote a series of stories in 1986 that smashed holes in Lucas’s account and described him as a fabricator who enjoyed the spotlight and the milkshakes provided by authorities as he unspooled concocted tales. Lucas later recanted his claims of being a serial killer. The stories in the Dallas Times Herald also suggested that law enforcement officials around the country were eager to believe Lucas to close unsolved murder cases. Mr. Aynesworth and Henderson were   for a Pulitzer Prize in various categories — one of four times Mr. Aynesworth would be a finalist for a Pulitzer. Mr. Aynesworth occasionally was asked to revisit Dealey Plaza to describe the day of the assassination. He’d point out where Oswald got on a bus and then, after a few blocks, got off and caught a cab. Oswald didn’t know how to drive and had no apparent getaway plan. “I know what you’re thinking,” Mr. Aynesworth once said. “You’re thinking that a man who had just killed a president wouldn’t do that, aren’t you? I didn’t believe it either … It may sound strange, but it’s what happened.” Hugh Grant Aynesworth was born Aug. 2, 1931, in Clarksburg, W.Va. He was raised by his mother, who took in laundry to help make ends meet. Mr. Aynesworth attended Salem College (now Salem University) for one semester and left to work as a freelancer for Clarksburg’s Exponent Telegram. He took reporting jobs in Arkansas and Texas and a stint at United Press International in Denver before joining the Dallas Morning News in 1960 to cover aerospace and science. While at UPI, a burglar broke into his apartment in 1959 and stabbed Mr. Aynesworth in the neck, leaving him with a six-inch scar from an injury that almost claimed his life. After leaving the Dallas Morning News in 1967, he spent eight years at Newsweek and then was on the investigative teams at the ABC News show “20/20” from 1979 to 1981 and the Dallas Times Herald from 1984 to 1986. He co-wrote several books with Michaud, including   (1989) based on their jailhouse interviews with the serial killer. Bundy was executed in the electric chair in Florida in 1989. Mr. Aynesworth’s marriages to Paula Ruth Eby and then Leslee Marie May ended in divorce. He married Paula Kathleen Butler in 1987. He had three children from his first marriage: daughters Allyson and Allyssa, and a son, Grant, who died in 2016. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. Although Mr. Aynesworth built a reputation toppling conspiracy theories, he advised young journalists never to snub a tip. “Don’t jump to conclusions,” he said, “the next flake you listen to may have the truth. You have to check them all out. I never believe anything anyone tells me, but I always check them out. If my own mother called, I would check her out.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/12/27/hugh-aynesworth-kennedy-journalist-dies/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 20:33:00,
"After a string of wins, Maryland’s animal welfare activists have set their sights on making cage-free eggs the only kind available in the state. Ten other states have laws banning eggs from chickens in battery cages, tight containers where hens can be packed 10 to a crate while unable to stand or turn around. Maryland’s animal-welfare lobby gathered at a farm sanctuary recently to draw attention to the possibility the state could soon join the effort, thanks to similar legislation proposed by a state senator. After a string of wins, Maryland’s animal welfare activists have set their sights on making cage-free eggs the only kind available in the state. Ten other states have laws banning eggs from chickens in battery cages, tight containers where hens can be packed 10 to a crate while unable to stand or turn around. Maryland’s animal-welfare lobby gathered at a farm sanctuary recently to draw attention to the possibility the state could soon join the effort, thanks to similar legislation proposed by a state senator. Consumer demand and pledges by major retailers have helped to grow the supply chain for cage-free eggs over the past decade. “This would be the most influential piece of animal welfare legislation ever passed in Maryland, just based on the sheer number of animals impacted,” Jennifer Bevan-Dangel, the Maryland lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States, said as white hens picked their way across the sanctuary’s yard. The Humane Society estimates 2 million birds in Maryland and another 4 million outside its borders would be affected because Maryland imports more eggs than it produces. The organization is considering pursuing similar bans in as many as five other states over the next two years. Advocates say they hope Maryland’s proposal would take effect in 2026. “Maryland is behind on this issue,” Bevan-Dangel said. “It’s beyond time for Maryland to keep up with the market.” The legislation’s prospects are unclear: Similar legislation didn’t come up for a vote earlier this year, although egg prices have since dropped and a pending Supreme Court challenge to state-level farm animal protections ultimately was resolved in favor of animal welfare groups. The Maryland Farm Bureau , citing the cost of transitioning to a cage-free operation and the likelihood it would drive some producers out of business. Maryland’s animal welfare lobby — a broad coalition of animal rights groups — is coming off a string of other successes in Annapolis, including becoming the second state to enact a  ,   and an adoption program for dogs used in medical research. Earlier this year, the state passed a first-in-the-nation program that requires companies doing certain types of animal research to pay into a fund that develops methods for future research to be conducted without animals. But none of Maryland’s recent animal welfare victories have addressed agricultural practices. “We’ve done so much progress on animal cruelty, but when it comes to agricultural practices, we haven’t even tried until now,” Robin Megibow, a longtime animal-welfare volunteer, said as chickens roamed about at Rosie’s Farm Sanctuary in Potomac. The sanctuary, which sits on five acres tucked into a residential neighborhood, hosts five pigs rescued from slaughterhouses, two dairy cows, six goats, a pair of miniature horses and some goats alongside the birds. Standing beside the chickens’ open-air cage, which includes rainbow-colored equipment, state Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick) said she was optimistic her legislation would be successful, as bills often are on their second tour through the General Assembly. The price of a dozen eggs peaked in January 2023 at $4.82 as the bill was introduced but had fallen to $2.07 in October, according to Federal Reserve Economic Data. “We’re in a much better economic environment than we were last year,” Lewis Young said, acknowledging that the agricultural farm lobby in Maryland — home to Perdue Farms and a slew of Eastern Shore poultry producers — have long been influential. “People don’t want to tell farmers what to do. I get that.” The other development animal welfare groups see as a benefit: In May, the Supreme Court  state-level protections in California, which applied to the pork industry but had ramifications across the nation’s agricultural industry. The decision permits states to bar within their borders sales of agricultural products raised elsewhere without the same humane regulations. Maryland’s large poultry industry primarily consists of the broiler chicken sector. It accounted for $6.7 billion in economic activity in Maryland in 2020, according to   from the U.S. Agriculture Department. The 10 other states that ban chickens packed in cages — ranging from California to Utah to Rhode Island — represent a small portion of the nation’s egg producers, even though nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population will live in states with such bans by 2026,   projections  The agency said an estimated 76 percent of U.S. eggs came from commercial caged systems in 2021. The Maryland Farm Bureau argued in written testimony that the economics of transitioning to cage-free eggs didn’t make sense for many producers. “The economic impact to an existing farm to make these changes is a 41% increase in cost of production to retrofit the existing barns and an 119% increase in labor,” farm bureau lobbyist Colby Ferguson wrote. “We oppose any legislation that would interfere with the right of farmers to raise livestock and poultry in accordance with commonly accepted agricultural practices.” The supply of cage-free eggs has not been enough to meet the goals of several major retailers, including McDonald’s, Walmart and Kroger, all three of which promised years ago eventually to stock only cage-free eggs. Walmart, for example, pledged to sell only cage-free eggs by 2025. In fiscal year 2023,   21 percent in its stores and 41 percent in its Sam’s Club locations.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/24/maryland-cage-free-egg-law/,Washington Post,2023-11-24 06:00:00,
"The Biden administration announced a new weapons package for Ukraine on Wednesday, marking what officials have said could be a final consignment from U.S. stockpiles unless Congress approves new funding for Kyiv’s battle against Russia.

The Biden administration announced a new weapons package for Ukraine on Wednesday, marking what officials have said could be a final consignment from U.S. stockpiles unless Congress approves new funding for Kyiv’s battle against Russia. The $250 million package, which includes artillery shells, air defense equipment, antiaircraft and antitank missiles, and small arms ammunition, comes at a  , as it faces a resilient adversary without the certainty of near-term help from its chief military backer. The announcement likewise underscores President Biden’s failure to convince congressional skeptics that America’s interests lie in ensuring Moscow cannot prevail in the war. While   have promised that Washington will support Kyiv “as long as it takes” against Russia, which after nearly two years of fighting occupies roughly a fifth of Ukraine, the future of U.S. aid is increasingly in doubt. Already since President Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion, the United States has committed $44 billion in security aid, including vehicles, air defense systems, missiles and bullets. Some of that assistance has been in the form of donations from U.S. arsenals, while other funds have gone toward procuring new weapons that must be produced in American factories, a process that can take several years. Administration officials have suggested in recent weeks that this weapons package, known as a “drawdown” from Pentagon inventories, was the last one they could make with existing funds, seeking to leverage what they have described as a dire funding situation to push Congress to approve Biden’s request for an additional $60 billion related to the war in Ukraine. Officials say the president’s emergency request, which also includes proposed funds for Israel in its war against   militants and other national security priorities, would secure Kyiv a needed lifeline in the wake of  , which failed to alter what Ukrainian officials now acknowledge is a battlefield stalemate. Lt. Col. Garron Garn, a Pentagon spokesman, said that while the administration had $4.2 billion left in its congressionally granted drawdown authority, it had run through funds the Pentagon uses to replenish U.S. stockpiles following such donations. “Now that the replenishment funds have fallen short of drawdown authority, we will rigorously assess the implications and ensure decisions align with broader strategic objectives,” Garn said in a statement. “Without the supplemental funding, there will be a shortfall in replenishing U.S. military stocks, affecting American military readiness.” Garn said there are also no funds remaining to place new factory orders for Ukraine. Biden’s supplemental request would give the administration an additional $7 billion in authority to make arms donations. It would also provide $18 billion for replenishing donated U.S. stocks and $12 billion for longer-term arms-manufacturing contracts for Ukraine, along with funding for U.S. military operations in Europe and investments in manufacturing missiles, which have proved a key capability against Russia. Garn did not say whether the administration intends to make additional donations to Ukraine despite the lack of replenishment funds. While White House officials had hoped to secure passage of its proposal by the end of the year, the effort is now mired in negotiations over Republican demands for changes to immigration policies. An in-person appeal by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who visited Washington in mid-December,   from some lawmakers for further outlays for Ukraine. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre underscored the administration’s sense of urgency in securing passage of the supplemental last week. “There’s one more … final aid that we can give to Ukraine,” she told reporters. “We are running out of aid to support the brave people of Ukraine.” Pentagon comptroller Michael McCord appealed to key lawmakers in a recent letter that it was “essential” they act on the supplemental request. “Doing so is in our clear national interest,” he wrote. “Our assistance is vitally needed so Ukraine can continue its fight for freedom and to ensure Russia continues to fail in Ukraine.” White House officials have emphasized Moscow’s extensive battlefield losses in Ukraine — including 87 percent of its invasion-era forces, according to U.S. estimates. But Russia has proved more capable of withstanding far-reaching Western sanctions than U.S. officials had hoped. Military production is on the rise, and Moscow is also receiving help from North Korea and Iran. For Ukraine, an ammunition shortage is  , potentially foreshadowing more dire military challenges in the year ahead.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — In this capital city, in the land of Brutus, Buckeyes and Blue Jackets, where the Scioto and Olentangy tangle and North Market dazzles with color and aroma, soccer will celebrate another special occasion Saturday. In the downtown Arena District, where the hockey complex, minor league ballpark and soccer stadium line up neatly along West Nationwide Boulevard, some 20,000 spectators will gather for the   between the Columbus Crew and reigning champion Los Angeles FC. For the third time in nine seasons, the Crew is hosting MLS’s championship match, adding to local soccer lore famous for World Cup qualifiers between the United States and Mexico. That five-cycle tradition ended when organizers moved it down Interstate 71 to Cincinnati. For the first time, MLS will settle matters at Lower.com Field, which is much more elegant than its name. It opened 2½ years ago, the culmination of desperate efforts to save an MLS founding member from skipping town. The previous times the Crew earned hosting rights — for a loss to Portland in 2015 and a victory over Seattle in 2020 — home was a simple stadium at the state fairgrounds, a few miles from the city center. The team is now housed in a modern gem, across the street from a repurposed power plant, where  is smothered in Crew black and gold. “The game has grown so much, not just the past couple years, but new leadership has come in and the new stadium,” Crew captain Darlington Nagbe said. “It’s been huge. It’s been great, and now hosting the MLS Cup hopefully will continue to grow the game here in Columbus and Ohio.” To reach the final, the Crew, seeded third in the Eastern Conference, needed to win a pair of away matches, first beating No. 2 Orlando, then toppling MLS’s best team in the regular season, FC Cincinnati, with a two-goal comeback and 3-2 extra-time victory last weekend. LAFC won the title last season at home, defeating the Philadelphia Union in a shootout after an extraordinary 3-3 draw through 120 minutes. Visitors this year, Coach Steve Cherundolo’s team is favored because it carries championship experience, among other formidable attributes. Still, “we have to play above our average to beat Columbus,” Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini said. The Angelenos will attempt to become the first team to repeat since their fierce SoCal rivals, the LA Galaxy, won in 2011 and 2012. Only two other teams have gone back to back: D.C. United in 1996-97 and the Houston Dynamo in 2006-07. It was not a smooth road to the final. After putting early-season efforts into a run to the finals of the Concacaf Champions League — a competition that has historically bruised MLS teams for the rest of the year — LAFC faltered in the U.S. Open Cup and inaugural Leagues Cup before landing third in the Western Conference standings. During the four-game playoff run, it did not concede a goal in the past three matches. “It’s a lot of emotion, and at the same time, you are tired physically,” attacker Carlos Vela said of the challenging campaign. “It’s a real battle with yourself. I am proud of what we did all season. We lost multiple [tournaments], but we are in a final again.” Cherundolo, a former U.S. national team right back, has already entered elite company. Only Bruce Arena (D.C.) and Brian Schmetzer (Seattle) have also coached in a final in each of their first two seasons. His counterpart, Wilfried Nancy, could make history as the first Black coach to lead a team to the trophy. The Frenchman is in his first season with the Crew after guiding Montreal for two seasons. “I am grateful to work for an organization that is clear about what they want to do,” Nancy said. But “without my players, I can’t do anything. The players on the pitch write the story.” The story has been written by Patrick Schulte, a 22-year-old goalkeeper who, until this year, had never appeared in an MLS match. It has been written by Cucho Hernández, a 24-year-old Colombian forward whose $10 million acquisition last year was the largest in club history. Columbus received a late-season boost with the signing of forward Diego Rossi, who starred for LAFC from 2018 to 2020 before moving to Fenerbahce in Turkey. Additional storytelling has been provided through veteran acquisitions: winger Julian Gressel, in a trade with Vancouver, and striker Christian Ramirez, another ex-LAFC member, in a preseason signing from Aberdeen in Scotland. Nancy’s system produced a league-high 67 goals in the regular season and 13 in five postseason games. “Watching their games, their goals, it’s beautiful,” Cherundolo said. Standing in the way of the Crew’s scoring threat is goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau, who suffered a broken leg disrupting a breakaway in extra time of the MLS Cup last year and did not return to until late this season. LAFC’s attack revolves around Vela, MLS’s MVP in 2019 who might be playing his final game for the club after six seasons, starting with the 2018 expansion campaign. Cherundolo values Vela’s skill set and the manner with which he has captained the squad. “And that is maybe more important rather than his left foot,” he said. “He’s our leader, and he is the least-selfish world-class player I’ve ever met.” While Vela is LAFC’s ringleader, Dénis Bouanga is its total-package forward — a player who parlays speed, technical ability, unpredictability and quick-thinking into devastating results. He has posted 24 goals in 35 games across the regular season and playoffs. Limiting Bouanga’s space on the flanks would go a long way toward the Crew lifting its third MLS Cup title in a life span that began in 1996 at Ohio State’s enormous football stadium. Before and after Saturday’s match, fans will gather at Betty’s Bar, a windowless concrete dive a field’s length from the stadium. No matter the result, there will be much to cherish. Nancy said, “The city, the fans, the organization and my players deserve it.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/08/columbus-crew-lafc-mls-cup-preview/,Washington Post,2023-12-08 15:30:00,
"At the news conference announcing him as the starting pitcher for the American League all-star team this summer, Gerrit Cole mostly smiled. But at one conspicuous moment, the New York Yankees ace winced. Dusty Baker, the AL manager, had referred to him as a Cy Young Award winner and, given Cole’s lengthy tenure as one of the game’s best starters, it was an easy mistake for Baker to make. At the news conference announcing him as the starting pitcher for the American League all-star team this summer, Gerrit Cole mostly smiled. But at one conspicuous moment, the New York Yankees ace winced. Dusty Baker, the AL manager, had referred to him as a Cy Young Award winner and, given Cole’s lengthy tenure as one of the game’s best starters, it was an easy mistake for Baker to make. But Cole knew — he could not forget, really — that despite five previous top-five finishes, six all-star selections and twice leading the majors in strikeouts, he had never won a Cy Young Award. That changed Wednesday, when Cole claimed the AL’s honor by a unanimous vote. San Diego Padres left-hander Blake Snell was the National League winner, collecting 28 of 30 first-place votes. For Cole — who led his league with 209 innings, a 2.63 ERA and .981 walks and hits per inning pitched — finally capturing the award at 33 was a milestone not without special meaning. “I’m extremely proud. It validates a lot of the hard work I’ve put in over the years and a lot of hard work that goes in behind the scenes from people in my corner,” said Cole, the No. 1 draft pick in 2011 who has validated every ounce of the hype that surrounded him when the Pittsburgh Pirates selected him. “We all dream about that growing up. Having put forth some seasons that are very much in the conversation for this award several times and just continuing to move forward and trudge along and try to be consistent and give my team a chance to win every day are more of the foundation that I work for,” Cole added. “This is kind of the fruits of your labor and the validation of what goes on behind the scenes.” Snell, 30, pitched to a 2.25 ERA in 180 innings, earning the second Cy Young of his career and his first in the NL. He pitched to a staggering 1.20 ERA over his final 23 starts. “I tried to dominate from the start. Sometimes it doesn’t go that way,” Snell said. “... Once you get in a rhythm and a groove, you can take it as far as you want.” Snell is something of an enigmatic winner, having led the majors with 99 walks. But he limited damage by holding opponents to a paltry .286 slugging percentage and left 86.7 percent of runners that reached against him on base, best in the majors. Cole, at 80.4 percent, was second. “I tried to be a pitcher that I wasn’t. ‘Oh, I can’t walk guys.’ When I walked more than two, I would get so mad at myself, like, ‘You’re better than that; stop doing this.’ I was more worried about what other people were saying,” Snell said. “Then I just kind of looked in the mirror and said: ‘I know how good I am, and if I walk guys, that’s okay for me. I’m different.’ And I believe that I have such good stuff. I know that one walk, it’s not going to end my success or end the game. By me doing that and understanding that I’m different but I’m really good at being different, that confidence kind of took over.” And just as the walks did not deter voters or prevent Snell from being one of the better run preventers in the sport, they probably will not prevent him from drawing a nine-figure free agent contract this offseason. The starting pitching market promises to be fiercely competitive, according to multiple executives participating in it. Snell is the top lefty available and one of the top available starters alongside Aaron Nola and Japanese import Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Snell is represented by agent Scott Boras, who helped Cole get the richest deal ever awarded a starting pitcher when he signed with the Yankees for nine years and $324 million before the 2020 season. This is the first time since 2018 and only the second in the past 10 years that neither Cy Young winner played for a postseason team — a particularly remarkable development given the postseason field has never been larger. All three NL finalists came from the NL West. San Francisco Giants righty Logan Webb finished second, and Arizona Diamondbacks ace Zac Gallen was third. Each got one first-place vote. Minnesota Twins righty Sonny Gray was second in the AL with 20 second-place votes.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/15/gerrit-cole-blake-snell-cy-young-awards/,Washington Post,2023-11-15 20:24:00,

Sam Howell to Dyami Brown for the TD! We're tied 26-26 with 52 seconds to go. 📺:   on FOX 📱: Stream on      Washington kept Seattle’s offense mostly in check, at least on the scoreboard, for three quarters before things  . The Seahawks, who snapped their streak of four consecutive games with multiple turnovers, moved the ball at will against the Commanders in the fourth quarter. Fox play-by-play man Kevin Kugler noted that Pete Carroll’s squad came into the game with nine drives of 10 plays or more all season, and had four such possessions against Washington. All of them resulted in points. Seattle demonstrated its quick-strike ability, too, with running back Kenneth Walker III’s 64-yard touchdown catch giving the Seahawks their first lead of the game in the third quarter. The Commanders were helpless in stopping a seven-play, 50-yard drive in the final minute that set up Jason Myers’s walk-off field goal. Washington allowed a season-high 489 total yards. Despite big days from Seattle’s DK Metcalf (98 yards) and Tyler Lockett (92 yards), Robinson was the game’s unlikely leading receiver. The second-year pro finished with six catches for 119 yards, the most by a Washington running back since Chris Thompson had six receptions for 150 yards in a 2017 win over the Raiders. Robinson’s 51-yard first-quarter touchdown catch was the Commanders’ longest play from scrimmage this season. He added a 48-yard catch on virtually the same play to set up a Joey Slye field goal in the third quarter. Robinson, who nearly tripled his previous career-high of 42 receiving yards, finished with as many catches as Washington wide receivers McLaurin (4), Curtis Samuel (2) and Jahan Dotson (0) combined. .  off to the races! 📺  : FOX  Sunday marked the second time this season — and the 10th time in franchise history — that the Commanders attempted at least 44 passes and rushed 14 or fewer times, according to Stathead. Washington is 0-10 in those games, including its 40-20 home loss to the Bears in October. Washington offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy’s apparent lack of interest in attempting to establish the run — the Commanders had five carries and 21 pass attempts in the first half — was surprising given that Seattle’s rushing defense was searching for answers after allowing 298 yards on the ground to the Ravens last week. Robinson finished with eight carries for 38 yards, including 27 on consecutive plays that sparked a fourth-quarter touchdown drive. Camaron Cheeseman’s long-snapping issues returned Sunday, and they might’ve cost Washington on multiple plays if not for its sure-handed punter. “I’m not concerned,” Commanders Coach   of Cheeseman’s struggles after watching Joey Slye miss his first extra point of the season following Washington’s first touchdown. “We got it straightened out at the end when it mattered.” In addition to snagging Cheeseman’s errant snaps in the rain, Way, the reigning NFC special teams player of the week, had two punts downed inside the 20. For the second consecutive game, Washington found itself on the wrong end of a controversial call that officials attempted to explain afterward. Last week, it was   against the Patriots. On Sunday, it was Commanders rookie cornerback Emmanuel Forbes Jr. being ejected for his helmet-to-helmet hit on Lockett in the first quarter. Forbes’s hit, while hardly vicious, warranted a flag for unnecessary roughness, but it was surprising to see a player without a history of dirty plays get tossed. NFL head of officiating Walt Anderson said the league’s replay office in New York determined  , which led to the decision to disqualify him. Here’s the hit that got Commanders CB Emmanuel Forbes ejected.  He was penalized for unnecessary roughness, then after further review he was disqualified.  Some potentially good news for the Commanders after a gut-wrenching loss: They get to face the Giants next week. New York defeated Washington, 14-7, in Week 7, but has since lost quarterbacks Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor to injury. Oddsmakers installed the Commanders as early 10-point favorites for the rematch at FedEx Field after Giants quarterback Tommy DeVito, an undrafted rookie, made his first start against the Cowboys on Sunday and was completely overmatched in a  . The Commanders have been a double-digit favorite five times since 2005, most recently in 2017 against the San Francisco 49ers. Washington is 3-2 in those games, and has covered the spread only once.

Still, operating from the comforts of a cozy pocket, Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith consistently had enough time to order a Starbucks and listen to most of Nirvana’s   while searching for open receivers downfield. Despite a shaky first half, Smith threw for a career-high 369 yards and a pair of touchdowns.

So tonight was an opportunity to send that message, and I hope everybody got it.” LOS ANGELES — Adrian Kempe had two goals, Kevin Fiala scored after being benched in the first period and the Los Angeles Kings overcame a poor start and beat the San Jose Sharks 5-1 on Wednesday night. “We’re gonna push the group for a polish up,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “We’ve going to need some clarity on exactly how we want to play in certain situations. So tonight was an opportunity to send that message, and I hope everybody got it.” Trevor Lewis and Pierre-Luc Dubois also scored for the Kings, who have won four of their last five games. David Rittich made 24 saves, following up a 4-1 win in his season debut against San Jose on Dec. 19 with another strong performance. Fabian Zetterlund scored and Kaapo Kahkonen allowed five goals on 43 shots as the Sharks lost their sixth straight game. Fiala made amends after being benched for the final 8:58 of the first period following his poor pass that led to San Jose’s opening goal. He scored on a breakaway 2:57 into the second. It was Fiala’s seventh goal and 30th point in 31 games, but his sloppiness with the puck has been a recurring issue in spite of that productivity. McLellan felt the time had come for punitive action in hopes of correcting it. “I thought it was a real good response, but we shouldn’t be put in that situation where we have to do that,” McLellan said. “And we talked about it, we talked about it. Those players have to play with risk in their game, especially a creative guy like Kev, but it’s happening a little too often. Water under the bridge now.” While McLellan said the action was directed solely at Fiala, he acknowledged it did have the added effect of helping shake up the entire team, as was evident when Lewis put Los Angeles ahead 13 seconds later by scoring on a backhand shot from close range after the forecheck forced a San Jose turnover. “They were faster, harder and more committed to doing things the right way than we were (in the first period), and there was no other adjustments we could give them if they wanted to recover and pull themselves back in the game,” McLellan said. The two quick strikes washed away whatever enthusiasm had been generated by Zetterlund’s 10th goal in 35 games, marking the first time in three NHL seasons he has reached the double-digit mark. Dubois wrapped up the scoring in the second with a goal for the second straight game, and Kempe struck twice in the third, including a precise tip of Matt Roy’s shot for his opener. “It just got away from us,” San Jose coach David Quinn said. “We got demoralized.” Both teams got players back from injury following time off. The Kings had defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov return from a lower-body injury that kept him out for five games, and the Sharks welcomed forward Alexander Barabanov (illness) and Calen Addison (lower body) following short-term absences. San Jose did not have goalie Mackenzie Blackwood available because of illness. Magnus Chrona was recalled from the AHL to back up Kahkonen. UP NEXT Sharks: Host the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday.

"LAS VEGAS — About 90 minutes before Sunday’s Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, Becky Hammon casually mentioned that she thought Jackie Young could be the X-factor in this series. Her declaration wasn’t exactly shocking; the Las Vegas Aces’ coach was talking about the 2019 No. 1 draft pick and a two-time all-star in the midst of a career year. LAS VEGAS — About 90 minutes before Sunday’s Game 1 of the WNBA Finals, Becky Hammon casually mentioned that she thought Jackie Young could be the X-factor in this series. Her declaration wasn’t exactly shocking; the Las Vegas Aces’ coach was talking about the 2019 No. 1 draft pick and a two-time all-star in the midst of a career year. Regardless, Young made her coach look like a soothsayer when she poured in 26 points to lead the Aces to a 99-82 victory over the New York Liberty in front of a star-studded crowd at Michelob Ultra Arena. “I think Jackie’s just scratching the surface of how great she can be,” Hammon said after the game. “She does so many things that help you win the game. She’s just one of those people that just keeps her nose to the ground. I just encourage her to be, like, aggressive — whatever that means. She’s a great decision-maker. She’s a big, strong guard that has defense first.” This is the matchup fans had been anticipating after both teams loaded up in the offseason. The Aces are the defending champions and feature A’ja Wilson, the 2022 MVP and back-to-back defensive player of the year, along with three other all-stars in the starting lineup. They added two-time MVP Candace Parker, who is out with a foot injury, and two-time champion Alysha Clark. The Liberty traded for 2021 MVP Jonquel Jones and signed Breanna Stewart, who won her second MVP award this season, and five-time all-star Courtney Vandersloot. Aces guard Kelsey Plum called this Finals matchup “inevitable.” All of that made Michelob Ultra Arena the place to be seen Sunday. LeBron James and Tom Brady, who recently bought a stake in the Aces, sat courtside. Actor Mark Wahlberg and singer-songwriter Kehlani were in the building. Jordin Sparks handled the national anthem, and Ashanti performed at halftime. Hall of Famer Sheryl Swoopes was present, too. Sunday’s opening 20 minutes were what anyone — famous or not — would have hoped for: a high-energy, back-and-forth affair with both teams hitting shots and putting together runs but never taking complete control. Neither team led by more than eight points in the first half. Any worries about a slow start after a lengthy layoff — the Aces last played Sept. 29, the Liberty on Oct. 1 — were quickly erased. Then the Aces came out of halftime throwing haymakers to improve to 6-0 in the postseason. “In the second half, the ball stopped and got stuck a little bit,” Stewart said, “and that made it easier for them to kind of crowd the paint on [Jones] or myself.” Game 2 of the best-of-five series is 9 p.m. Wednesday. Young and Wilson combined for 21 of the Aces’ 26 points in the third quarter, and the Las Vegas defense picked up the intensity. The quarter ended with a Young blow-by of Vandersloot before she got to the rim and double-pumped as Vandersloot slapped her arms. She banked in the runner for an and-one while Chelsea Gray shouted at her teammate, bouncing up and down before slapping her hand. Young’s free throw gave the Aces a 72-65 lead — their biggest to that point — heading into the fourth. [Hammon has] believed in me since she got here last year, and she just has a lot of confidence in me,” Young said. “I know my teammates do, coaches do. And so that gives me confidence to just be able to go out there and play my game. Just be aggressive from the beginning, hit open shots. Just take what the defense gives me. But I think the biggest thing is just being confident.” That was the beginning of the end for the Liberty. Young’s three-point play started a 23-6 run that had the building rocking. Jackie was my rookie — she’s my baby sister that I never wanted, but I love her to death,” Wilson said with a laugh. “And I’m going to make sure that I am pulling that confidence out of her. Jackie’s a little shy; she kind of likes to beat around bushes, but I’m like: ‘Absolutely not. That’s not you. I know you have it in you’ — and I love pulling that out of her. “People raised an eyebrow at us when we drafted her number one. I was like, ‘You need to prove every single night that you are the number one draft pick — every single night.’ ... That’s who we need every single night.” Young, Wilson (19 points, eight rebounds), Plum (26 points) and Gray (20 points, nine assists, six rebounds) combined for 91 points, the most by a quartet in WNBA Finals history. Las Vegas outscored New York 53-33 in the second half while shooting 54.7 percent for the game. “Our trio of guards I thought were pretty ridiculous overall,” Hammon said. Stewart finished with 21 points and nine rebounds. Jones added 16 points and 10 rebounds — for her seventh double-double of the playoffs, the most in a single WNBA postseason — and Marine Johannès had 14 points off the bench. The Liberty’s guards were outscored 72-31; all-star Sabrina Ionescu was held to seven. “Our guards, they just had a little bit of a tough night,” New York Coach Sandy Brondello said. “That’s not going to happen two games in a row. We believe in them. They’ve carried us all season long. We’ll still put the ball in their hands, and we want them to be confident and do what they do. ... They’re going to be fine. It’s a series. They took the first punch, and now we have to have to respond.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/08/aces-win-wnba-finals-game-1-new-york-liberty/,Washington Post,2023-10-08 19:51:00,
"See, you have to understand that before Washington, D.C., my hometown, was a pro football town, it was a basketball town. A Black basketball town, to be specific. Basketball became as much the heartbeat of Black Washington as Howard University, as U Street, as half-smokes and go-go. There is an honoree at the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.,  : See, you have to understand that before Washington, D.C., my hometown, was a pro football town, it was a basketball town. A Black basketball town, to be specific. Basketball became as much the heartbeat of Black Washington as Howard University, as U Street, as half-smokes and go-go. There is an honoree at the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.,  : “When Edwin Bancroft Henderson introduced his hometown of Washington, D.C. to basketball in 1907, the game was still less than two decades old. Basketball was largely a segregated enterprise in those days, taking a cue from the broader set of symptoms that plagued America during the period of Jim Crow. Henderson, Harvard educated and civic minded, organized play for African-American youth in the D.C. metropolitan area and soon basketball was all the rage.” Henderson spawned the all-Black Washington Bears, who won the 1943 World Professional Basketball Tournament. They begot Elgin Baylor, who begot Tom Hoover and John Thompson, who begot Dave Bing, who begot Fatty Taylor and Austin Carr, who begot Kermit Washington, who begot Adrian Dantley, who begot Penny Toler ( ), who begot Adrian Branch, Johnny Dawkins, Thurl Bailey and Tom Sluby, who begot Walt Williams, who begot Randolph Childress, who begot Steve Francis, who begot Kevin Durant et al. Wizards owner Ted Leonsis knows as much. Because last summer, his Leonsis Foundation and his company, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, pushed to $220,000  , from which Henderson graduated when it had another name, to fund its Dr. E.B. Henderson Memorial Fund and erect a statue of Henderson in front of the sports complex named after him on UDC’s main campus in Upper Northwest. That’s why what unfolded the past few days — with Leonsis   from Capital One Arena south across the Potomac to a plot of land he will develop in Northern Virginia — hurts so, so much. It isn’t merely a relocation. It isn’t just a few more stops away on Metro’s Yellow Line, as some have dismissively said. No, it’s a stabbing, a deep stabbing. An excision. A cutting out of yet another part of what was the soul of this city, like  , the nightclub where my parents went back in their day and I went as an adult upon my return, and like the threat of pickleball  . All in a city that  , that became known as Chocolate City (thank you, George Clinton) and that only just in the most recent census  . The Wizards became the personification of our pastime, our representation, through good and bad, in the NBA. And they’re going to Alexandria, Va. It may be barely four miles away in distance from downtown D.C., but it is much further culturally and psychologically. Look no further than Leonsis   (R) on Wednesday to make his painful relocation announcement. That alone aggravated the wound. While running for governor, Youngkin touted the basketball skills that earned him a scholarship to Rice, but he has become better known for   of ;   in the Virginia Department of Education; and   for school parents to report teachers they thought employed the boogeyman higher education analysis of U.S. systems called critical race theory. Youngkin has been pandering to his reactionary base in a state  . Alexandria, where he celebrated with Leonsis on Monday,  . It all renders the marketing of the Wizards disingenuous. Just as the franchise once paid homage to Baltimore by being named after that city’s most famous piece of architecture — the Phoenix Shot Tower, which as the country’s tallest building in the 19th century turned molten lead into bullets — the D.C. iteration appropriated D.C. culture, most notably the playing of our indigenous go-go music at games. It even named its minor league team — which Leonsis almost altruistically planted in the city’s poorest ward, Ward 8 in Southeast —  . A Wizards team in Virginia should no longer get down to go-go. Just like Alexandria City Council member John Taylor Chapman (D) should not sport — for the Wizards in Virginia — the D.C. scarf he audaciously draped around his neck onstage with Leonsis and Youngkin. The Leonsis plan is reminiscent of the most recent major city arena moves, from Oakland and Atlanta. Oakland, a city  , lost its perennial NBA champion Warriors to Whiter, wealthier San Francisco and its football and baseball teams to a   Las Vegas. This isn’t to say Leonsis purposely stole away D.C.’s Wizards to a less diverse clientele, but it is an undeniable, uncomfortable consequence. Just as in Cobb County, Ga., where the Atlanta baseball team   far from its old downtown home. Leonsis imitated owners in those cities who have explained they bailed on their longtime homes because they wanted space to build more than an arena. “Frankly, I’m not sure you could find too many owners who have put serious thought into the communities around them, which is why it’s so important for policymakers and community leaders to push back when a team wants to move in or, in this case, move out,” Timothy Kellison, an associate professor in sport management at Florida State who has written extensively on the issue, emailed me. “To me, it very much parallels the White flight that happened in the 1950s and 60s.” Sports stadiums aren’t just for stadiums’ sake anymore. We get that. We have witnessed   in Southeast. Stadiums have turned into real estate deals to develop other entertainment, and maybe even housing, around the perimeter. All of which reminds that neither D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) nor the D.C. Council is without blame for what will be an absolute fiasco if Alexandria and the Virginia legislature approve. Bowser talked a lot about   but not nearly as much about retaining the basketball and hockey team, the Capitals. As D.C. Council member Charles Allen (D)  : “Investing in Capital One Arena instead of RFK makes sense. … Capital One Arena is active year-round and sits on top of one of the most connected metro stations in the country. It anchors two teams that play more than 80 home games a year, is home court for the Georgetown Hoyas and hosts concerts and special events, bringing more than 2 million people annually to the area for about 230 to 240 events a year.” In the years before I started writing about sports, I covered economics. And one thing I recall about economic development is that retaining business is a better priority than chasing it. Rather than looking at the old RFK Stadium site as a plot for a new NFL edifice, the city should have revived thinking of it as space for a new basketball and hockey arena with plenty of acreage for other uses around it. But if this is a done deal, then so much of D.C. as I grew up is done, too. D.C. can’t support a future NBA team or NHL franchise with its former flagships across the bridge. We aren’t New York. We aren’t Los Angeles. And Virginia isn’t D.C.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/15/washington-dc-wizards-move-nba/,Washington Post,2023-12-15 14:12:00,
"COLUMBUS, Ohio — As MLS prepares to wrap up its 28th season Saturday, Commissioner Don Garber on Friday reflected on a year dominated by   and looked ahead to the Argentine superstar’s return for a full campaign in 2024. “Lionel Messi had many options for the next chapter of his iconic soccer-playing career,” Garber said during his state of the league address. “The magnitude of his decision to join MLS cannot be overstated.” COLUMBUS, Ohio — As MLS prepares to wrap up its 28th season Saturday, Commissioner Don Garber on Friday reflected on a year dominated by   and looked ahead to the Argentine superstar’s return for a full campaign in 2024. “Lionel Messi had many options for the next chapter of his iconic soccer-playing career,” Garber said during his state of the league address. “The magnitude of his decision to join MLS cannot be overstated.” Messi’s impact was felt on the field, where he picked up where he left off in a storied club career that began in Barcelona and passed through Paris before landing with Inter Miami in August. It was also felt off the field, where his presence in the relatively young league boosted marketing power, ticket sales and Apple TV Plus subscriptions. “The eyes of the world are now on Major League Soccer because the best player to ever play the game is here,” Garber said. “And he succeeded.” Less than a year after  , the 36-year-old forward posted 11 goals and eight assists in 14 matches across all competitions and bolstered the fortunes of lowly Inter Miami. MLS and Apple have declined to release subscription and viewership data, though people familiar with the new 10-year deal said Messi provided a substantial bump. Multiple Miami matches drew more than a million viewers on the pay service, Apple officials have said. Some matches remain available on standard TV outlets. Saturday’s final between the Columbus Crew and Los Angeles FC will appear on Fox as well as Apple TV Plus. MLS’s current task regarding Messi is deciding where he will visit in 2024. The 29 teams play most of their 34 regular season games within the conference, which means the other 14 Eastern Conference teams will host Messi and Miami once. This season, Miami’s three nonconference away matches were at Houston, St. Louis and LAFC. MLS will release the full schedule Dec. 20. The league will not choose Miami’s nonconference away destinations based solely on market size and potential ticket sales, Garber said. “We don’t think that’s fair,” he added. MLS will create a formula to ensure Messi appears in most, if not all, markets by 2025. Because of the number of teams, though, nonleague matches might figure into the equation. There is also the issue of sustaining elevated interest in the league after Messi retires; his contract runs through 2025. “We’ve got to look at it all, including our roster rules, to ensure that, with a growing audience, we can capture the support and the attention of a whole new audience of soccer fans. That’s ultimately the process that we’re going through now,” Garber said. “Is the system we have in place the right system and can we evolve it or tweak it in ways to ensure that we’re capturing the market?” Aside from Messi, Garber sees the 2026 World Cup, which will take place in the United States, Mexico and Canada, as the primary springboard to greater popularity. “That is the pressure that we’re under to ensure: As everybody’s paying attention to us, what is the product we can deliver?” Garber said. “Where do we want to be by 2027?” Fitting into soccer’s congested schedule is another challenge. This year, MLS will balance the regular season, Leagues Cup and U.S. Open Cup with an international calendar that includes the U.S.-hosted Copa América. The European Championship and Paris   will also cut into MLS’s audience. The following year, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup will take place in the United States. Then comes the World Cup in 2026. “We can’t afford” to shut down the league for an extended period in any year, Garber said. “MLS has to deliver for all of our stakeholders. That being said, we’ve got to manage through that process and be clever and creative. … Clearly the World Cup is an entirely different animal — I can’t imagine playing games during the World Cup — but the economic impact of that is significant.” Among the ideas for 2026 is splitting the season into two parts, like Mexico’s Liga MX does, to clear the summer months, Garber said. Weather, however, would impact many markets in the winter. “Should we be thinking about playing in a single destination for a period of time during winter months?” Garber said. “Who knows? Maybe that might be the answer.” : MLS has no plans at this point to expand beyond 30 teams after San Diego enters in 2025, Garber said. “But I’ll say I never say never to anything,” he added. “You’ve got to look at how all this develops over the next number of years.” … The league will not add a fourth designated player slot for each team, Garber said. The DP roster designation is for high-end players, such as Messi, whose multimillions in earnings count only $650,000 against the salary cap.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/08/lionel-messi-mls-inter-miami/,Washington Post,2023-12-08 18:06:00,
"A Maryland police union says a new law meant to allow access to officer disciplinary records should not apply to those created before the law took effect. Release of the records would be unfair to an officer, the union says, because he was guaranteed confidentiality when the investigation into his conduct took place. A Maryland police union says a new law meant to allow access to officer disciplinary records should not apply to those created before the law took effect. Release of the records would be unfair to an officer, the union says, because he was guaranteed confidentiality when the investigation into his conduct took place. The argument is among those from Montgomery County Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 35 in a case widely seen as an early test of Anton’s Law, passed by state lawmakers in 2021 to ensure public access to complaints of police misconduct. The FOP and Montgomery County police officer John J. Gloss sued the county last year, seeking to prevent the release of records to a woman he had pulled over in 2010. The plaintiffs face opposition from several organizations advocating for transparency. But first a court must decide how much of the case itself the public should see, a decision that will help shape a broader struggle between protecting officers from reputational damage and delivering disclosure that lawmakers hoped would ensure accountability at a time when public trust in law enforcement had plummeted. Anton’s Law, named for a Black teen   in an encounter with police in Greensboro, Md., in 2018, was ushered in   policing by the state’s Democratic-controlled legislature in 2021. The state’s governor at the time, Larry Hogan (R), warned that aspects of the legislation would hurt police recruitment and retention. Against this backdrop, the police union is searching for its legal footing in Gloss’s case. Where lawyers for Gloss see an overstepping of the new law’s boundaries, lawyers for the woman and third-party filers see a textbook example of what the new law was intended to provide: access to records that allow watchdog groups, journalists and the public to see whether officers have troubling records and assess whether departments are adequately policing their own. “We just want to give effect to Anton’s Law as it was passed — to protect the rights that the legislature clearly said that the citizens had to see and obtain records of police misconduct under the Maryland Public Information Act,” said Jared S. Bauman, a third-year law student at Vanderbilt University who is among those advocating on behalf of the woman who requested the records. Material unredacted so far gives a preview of what the FOP may argue. Gloss and others involved in investigations of his conduct “could not have anticipated that the information they shared would be subject to public disclosure,” FOP lawyers said in a memorandum filed under seal in September 2022, a redacted version of which is now publicly available in court records. The FOP’s memorandum decries the retroactive nature of Anton’s Law, which deemed police disciplinary records no longer prohibited from release as “personnel” records without distinguishing between investigations done before or after the law took effect. The union’s lawyers argue that officers’ prior assurance of confidentiality under the Maryland Public Information Act was a “vested right” — one protected from change by the legislature. But large swaths of the FOP’s memorandum remain blacked out, and the court is scheduled in January to hear arguments on how much of it should remain so. The union, with the county’s consent,   and proceed with the case out of public view. But The Washington Post, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and others   to secure public access to the court filings and hearings. “Given that the substance of this lawsuit is a frontal attack by the union on the most important transparency law that Maryland has passed since the Public Information Act itself, the idea that that was going to be litigated in secret was beyond absurd,” said David Rocah, the senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Maryland. Montgomery County Circuit Court Associate Judge Karla N. Smith reversed the sealing in February, but she ordered the parties’ lawyers to seek agreement on redactions to the filings that would protect the internal affairs information at issue in the suit. Since then, how much to redact has been the subject of filings by all parties, which include the woman  , Alexa Renehan, who has legal help from the Vanderbilt Law School’s First Amendment Clinic and the Baltimore Action Legal Team. When Anton’s Law passed, Renehan decided to find out what happened to the police officer she complained about a decade earlier, after a traffic stop she felt he handled inappropriately. She requested Gloss’s entire internal affairs record, which over the years included sustained allegations regarding “Conformance to Law” and “Conduct Unbecoming,” along with other allegations that were not sustained, according to records released to her so far. The interveners, which also include the Maryland Coalition for Justice and Police Accountability, have yet to confront in court filings what has so far been the FOP’s main contention — that release of Gloss’s disciplinary records would violate his rights. Police disciplinary records are easily available in many states, including Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin. New York a few years ago repealed its law shielding disciplinary records from disclosure, and New York City police made public a searchable database of records that had been secret for decades. Several unions fought vigorously to prevent the disclosure, but a federal appeals court rejected their arguments. Much of the disagreement ahead of a hearing scheduled for Jan. 10 stems from the FOP lawyers’ redaction of basic information about the internal affairs files that the county already released to Renehan in response to her records request. The interveners argue it would be improper to conceal in court filings information that already has been revealed publicly in Post articles and elsewhere. “We think the redactions should be as narrow as possible, since what this case is about at its heart is transparency,” Rocah said. The FOP lawyers are arguing for broader redactions. “Even though some publicly known facts may exist, this does not allow anyone to conclude that those facts are contained within the subject administrative personnel records at issue in this case,” the lawyers wrote in a filing. The FOP lawyers also argue that Gloss should retain his anonymity in the case’s caption, which now reads: Officer John Doe, et al. v. Montgomery County, Maryland. The interveners say the use of the pseudonym was improper to begin with and is particularly unwarranted now that the officer’s identity is well known. “We see no reason to keep this facade of a pseudonym going forward because this information's already out there,” Bauman said. FOP lawyer Anthony Conti declined to comment on the case. “Please do not contact me or my clients,” he told a Post reporter in an email.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/24/antons-law-police-union-transparency/,Washington Post,2023-11-24 06:00:00,

While UCF hasn’t been stung all that much by player departures, Georgia Tech will be without   (team-high six sacks) and cornerback Kenan Johnson (the team’s highest-rated defensive player, per Pro Football Focus). That could leave an already shaky defense even more vulnerable, and I think points will be the order of the day.  over 64.5 Not only did James Madison   (along with both coordinators and its quarterbacks coach), but 10 starters are in the transfer portal,   behind Texas A&M and Oregon State. But all of them   for defensive lineman Mikail Kamara (6.5 sacks in 2023) and offensive lineman Carter Miller (nine starts this season) are expected to play in the bowl game. Air Force has not had any departures of note, and quarterback Zac Larrier is   from the knee injury he battled over the final third of the season. The Falcons were not the same without Larrier: After starting the season 8-0 and rising to No. 17 in the country, Air Force lost its last four games. This game pits Air Force’s rushing offense (No. 2 nationally at 275.8 yards per game) against James Madison’s rushing defense (No. 1 at 61.5 yards allowed per game and also No. 1 in  ). But in general, I tend to side with good rushing offenses in bowl games: Over the past 12 years, teams that rank in the top 10 in rushing yards per game at the end of the season are 57-36 against the spread in bowl games, and under Coach Troy Calhoun,  . With Larrier back, the Falcons will look more like the team that started the season hot and can keep this close.  Air Force +2.5 Three of Georgia State’s top six offensive players in terms of Pro Football Focus grade headed to the transfer portal: running back Marcus Carroll (112.5 rushing yards per game, which ranks eighth nationally, and 274 carries, which ranks second), wide receiver Robert Lewis (team-high 70 catches, seven for touchdowns) and starting right tackle Montavious Cunningham. The ball ended up in Carroll’s or Lewis’s hands on 42.5 percent of the Panthers’ offensive snaps, and now both are gone. Utah State has seen few defections of note. The Aggies had quarterback issues all season, with Cooper Legas and backup McCae Hillstead battling injuries, but they might be in good shape with third-stringer Levi Williams, who threw for two touchdowns and ran for three more in the regular season finale against New Mexico (a win that got Utah State to a bowl game). Williams previously played at Wyoming and — in this very same game in 2021 — became the first quarterback to rush for 200 yards, score four rushing touchdowns and throw for a score in a bowl.

"After more than half a century in Oakland and more than a decade of public feuds with a city that loved them dearly, the Athletics are officially clear to move to Las Vegas. The 29 other major league owners unanimously voted to approve the move Thursday at their meetings in Texas. After more than half a century in Oakland and more than a decade of public feuds with a city that loved them dearly, the Athletics are officially clear to move to Las Vegas. The 29 other major league owners unanimously voted to approve the move Thursday at their meetings in Texas. The Athletics will be the first team to relocate since the Montreal Expos moved to Washington and became the Nationals ahead of the 2005 season. Before that, the most recent team to relocate was the Senators, who moved from Washington to Texas in 1972. “I know this is a terrible day for fans in Oakland. I understand that,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said. “That’s why we always had a policy of doing everything humanly possible to avoid a relocation, and I truly believe we did that in this case.” Relocations can scar baseball fandoms for generations (see also: Dodgers, Brooklyn). But this one has been particularly painful for Oakland fans who watched A’s owner John Fisher dial back already limited investment in his roster over the course of several years, changing a once-plucky organization that won on a budget into one that traded anyone who started making a few million dollars, therefore populating the rosters of rivals with stars Oakland developed but chose not to pay. Fisher engaged in a drawn-out spat with Oakland officials over public funding for a new stadium  . The city fired back, showing years of plans and agreements for a ballpark project. All the while the Oakland Coliseum crumbled, resulting in an MLB-issued ultimatum: Either the A’s get a deal for a new stadium in place by 2024 or they lose the revenue sharing money they claim keeps their organization afloat. “Today is an incredibly difficult day for Oakland A’s fans,” Fisher said at a news conference Thursday that marked his first public comments in years of maneuvering for a new stadium. “It’s a great day for Las Vegas.” “We did everything we could to find a solution there,” he added. “It was only in the last couple years we turned our attention to another market.” His A’s have a deal for a stadium in Las Vegas that includes $380 million in public funding for what is estimated to be a $1.5 billion ballpark setup near the Strip. But approval for that public funding, signed into law by Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) in June, did not come easily and is not being allowed to stand without a fight: A Nevada teachers union is filing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of using public funding for the stadium amid gaps in the state’s education system, though it is unclear when that suit might be resolved. Either way, Manfred confirmed Thursday that MLB would not charge the A’s a relocation fee, given Fisher’s presumed financial commitment to the new ballpark. Even if everything goes to plan — and very little has during the A’s hunt for a new stadium — the ballpark would not be open until 2028. The A’s lease at the Coliseum expires after next season, meaning baseball would need to find a temporary home for the A’s for three seasons. MLB and team officials have said a variety of facilities would be under consideration for their temporary home, including San Francisco’s Oracle Park or the Vegas home of Oakland’s Class AAA team, the Aviators. “We’re exploring a variety of alternatives, including staying at the Coliseum for the remaining years in the interim,” Manfred told reporters Thursday. But what is not clear is how baseball will fare in Vegas, which is rated the nation’s 40th-largest media market  , when Fisher claimed it could not survive in Oakland, part of the 10th-largest market, along with San Francisco. Certainly, he is not the only one, and MLB is not the only league to target Las Vegas as a potential untapped market for professional sports. The NHL expanded there with the Golden Knights for the 2017-18 season. The NFL’s Raiders moved there from Oakland before the 2020 season. The NBA is reportedly targeting Vegas for expansion whenever it adds more teams. Much of Las Vegas’s appeal comes from the millions of tourists who funnel through each year, so there is some question how an everyday sport such as baseball, which relies so much on its teams’ connections to their cities, will fare there. The Golden Knights,  , finished last season 12th in the NHL in attendance. This season, the Raiders rate last in the NFL  . “The fans there are terrific,” Fisher said. “The success of the Raiders and the Golden Knights has shown, as well as our own Triple-A team, has shown just how successful professional sports can be in that market.” Still, Las Vegas is not without strong baseball ties. Greg and Mike Maddux are natives. Bryce Harper, Kris Bryant, Bryson Stott and others have headlined a recent crop of homegrown Vegas stars now soaring in the majors. “Are they really going to sell out for a Yankees game on a Friday night?”  . “Is it going to happen? I don’t know. I have no idea. I don’t think anybody knows. … Do you think people are going to drop the Cubs or the White Sox to be A’s fans? There’s no way. No chance. But that 5- or 6-year-old, in the next 10 years, they could grow up A’s fans. In 10 years, you could have a lot of fans.” Manfred has long said that finding resolution for two of the baseball’s more out-of-date facilities, the Rays’ home in St. Petersburg and the A’s in Oakland, would potentially clear the way for expansion. Now, the Rays  . The A’s appear headed to Las Vegas, though no shovels have dug a foundation in the Nevada desert just yet. Nashville has long been considered a front-runner to be the next baseball town, and a well-established group of investors has been lobbying for a team for years. As for other cities on the radar, MLB almost certainly would listen if an ownership hopeful wanted to test Fisher’s claim that baseball could not survive in Oakland. It did, after all, thrive there for quite some time. “We are disappointed by the outcome of this vote. But we do not see this as the end of the road. We all know there is a long way to go before shovels in the ground and that there are a number of unresolved issues surrounding this move,” Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao said in a statement. “I have also made clear to the Commissioner that the A’s branding and name should stay in Oakland and we will continue to work to pursue expansion opportunities. Baseball has a home in Oakland even if the A’s ownership relocates.” Fisher and his deputy, Dave Kaval, have said they plan to take the A’s name with them to Vegas. The A’s name moved with them from Philadelphia to Kansas City in 1954, then from Kansas City to Oakland in 1967, when cantankerous owner Charlie Finley said his team needed a more viable market. Thursday’s unanimous vote was not a declaration that Oakland is not and cannot be a viable market for MLB. It was, rather, a reflection of the sense among owners and executives that Oakland was not going to be a viable market for a John Fisher-owned team. Everyone in the sport agreed the Coliseum was too dilapidated to house an MLB franchise long term. Fisher insisted that whatever funding the city was trying to provide for a new stadium was not enough to make things work. To Oakland fans facing a future without baseball after several demoralizing seasons under Fisher’s lead, it probably will feel as if no amount of money could have convinced him to stay.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/16/oakland-as-relocation-las-vegas-mlb-owners/,Washington Post,2023-11-16 14:10:00,
"D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on Tuesday unveiled a revised version of her administration’s 2017 sexual harassment policy, which she had been under pressure to review after her chief of staff and closest adviser, John Falcicchio, resigned in March following accusations of sexual harassment. The mayor’s new order updates the definition of sexual harassment to  and makes other changes that District officials said aim to offer increased clarity for government employees. Among the biggest changes: The new order prohibits sexual or intimate relationships between supervisors and their employees, and now requires D.C. employees to undergo sexual harassment training annually, instead of every other year. D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) on Tuesday unveiled a revised version of her administration’s 2017 sexual harassment policy, which she had been under pressure to review after her chief of staff and closest adviser, John Falcicchio, resigned in March following accusations of sexual harassment. The mayor’s new order updates the definition of sexual harassment to  and makes other changes that District officials said aim to offer increased clarity for government employees. Among the biggest changes: The new order prohibits sexual or intimate relationships between supervisors and their employees, and now requires D.C. employees to undergo sexual harassment training annually, instead of every other year. “We are underscoring the message that D.C. government does not, will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment,” Bowser told D.C. Council members in a breakfast meeting Tuesday. “This has always been our value, and we have certainly seen over the last several months that we can have an even stronger policy in place. So this order, we believe, will set that clear expectation at every level.” Falcicchio, who also served as deputy mayor for planning and economic development, was accused of prolonged sexual harassment by two women who worked in the planning and economic development department, which he led. The scandal sent shock waves through D.C. government, provoking questions about how one of the most powerful men in Bowser’s orbit allegedly pursued women in his chain of command and made unwanted sexual advances without consequence. Beyond Falcicchio,   that about 300 D.C. employees — and in some cases students — had lodged complaints of sexual harassment since Bowser’s 2017 order went into effect, showing the breadth of the issue within District government for the first time and exposing gaps in the policy’s enforcement. Bowser’s new order appears intended to address those gaps, affecting employees on all levels and making changes that in some cases appear to be in response to Falcicchio’s alleged misconduct and abuses of power. Some of the changes are aimed at uneven power dynamics, namely the ban on romantic or sexual relationships within a chain of command or with interns and recruits. That policy could have been relevant in Falcicchio’s case: One of the women, a junior staffer,   that she feared Falcicchio would fire her or give her undesirable work assignments if she did not go along with his flirtatious overtures or pretend to be interested in him, though she ultimately rebuffed his attempts to have sex with her. The policy on workplace relationships also creates new reporting requirements for consensual relationships between employees and supervisors within a chain of command. Bowser had ordered the D.C. Human Resources Department to develop a policy for reporting such relationships under her   — but the department never did that, and her administration has not explained why. Individual city agencies will have the ability to define a chain of command as it pertains to the order, city officials said. Starting in November, agencies are instructed to begin asking employees in relationships that are prohibited under the new order to disclose them. While employees in this scenario may request a waiver, the order outlines several remedies to help these relationships comply with the new order — such as a shift in reporting structure or even helping an employee find a different role. Michelle Bercovici, a D.C.-based employment lawyer who has handled sexual harassment cases, described the changes as positive and long overdue, especially those relating to workplace relationships. “The biggest takeaway is the government is now taking a very strong stance against relationships between supervisors and subordinates, recognizing the power dynamic in the workplace,” Bercovici said. The new order also requires sexual harassment complaints lodged against top officials (including the mayor, her , her chief of staff and her administration’s deputy mayors, among others) to be referred to the Office of the Inspector General. The inspector general will then assess the credibility of the complaint and, if justified, refer it to an outside investigator. That change also appears to be in direct response to the Falcicchio case and mirrors legislation introduced by council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) over the summer after D.C. Council members expressed concern about the executive branch investigating its own top brass accused of misconduct. The Mayor’s Office of Legal Counsel investigated both complaints against Falcicchio and substantiated allegations of unwanted sexual advances and lewd messages in both of them, though it was unable to substantiate other allegations including retaliation and bullying. Nadeau said she was pleased to see the provision allowing the inspector general to launch third-party investigations in Bowser’s order. But she said she still plans to hold a hearing on her legislation, probably in December, to solicit feedback from experts and the public. “First and foremost, this is a positive development for the District government — I certainly commend the mayor for taking this step,” Nadeau said. “I think there continues to be a role for the council here in ensuring that changes like this can be made permanent and that they are exactly the right changes that need to be made.” Rank-and-file employees may see the most significant change in how their complaints of sexual harassment are investigated. The new standards for sexual harassment are intended to align with a 2022 law that broadened the definition of harassment and lowered the burden on victims to show they had been harassed. It’s unclear why it took the Bowser administration more than a year to revise District policy to reflect the law; Bowser said earlier in October that she could not explain why her administration did not move more quickly or make it a priority to do that, though city officials indicated Tuesday that some delays in updating the policy were related to working out various scenarios that might arise under the new order. In the meantime, more than two dozen cases may have been investigated under an outdated standard. Under the 2017 order, sexual harassment had to be “severe or pervasive” for agencies to find an accused employee in violation of the policy. But while that standard has been the norm nationwide, employment lawyers have said it’s notoriously difficult for victims to prove. The Post found in its review of nearly 300 complaints that agency leaders sometimes struggled to apply that standard, leading to uneven enforcement of the policy. For example, the Department of Health found that an employee probably slapped a woman’s behind, and in another case, the Department of Motor Vehicles found that an employee said he would spank a woman and often engaged in unwanted sexual conversations. But neither agency found the accused employees in violation of Bowser’s policy. Following the lead of several states, the D.C. Council changed the law last summer to eliminate the “severe or pervasive” standard. Instead it required that the “totality of circumstances” be considered, noting that no specific frequency of incidents or level of egregiousness is required to prove harassment. Bowser’s updated order also seeks to clarify the required training for each agency’s sexual harassment officer and the various avenues for employees to lodge complaints, and it establishes a task force to make recommendations related to trainings and policy changes. A report detailing the recommendations from the task force — which will be made up of representatives from the Office of Human Rights, the Mayor’s Office of Legal Counsel and the Department of Human Resources — is due by May 1. In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Debra S. Katz and Kayla Morin, attorneys representing the two D.C. government employees who accused Falcicchio of sexual harassment, applauded the changes in Bowser’s order — namely, the provisions that broaden the definition of harassment and make the mayor’s direct reports subject to an outside investigation. “While work remains to be done to build a workplace free from sexual harassment in the D.C. government, the new policy is a significant step forward in achieving that goal,” the attorneys wrote. For some who have been affected by sexual harassment on the job, the policy changes on paper are encouraging — but they matter only if D.C. supervisors and agency leaders carry them out in good faith. Emily Heller, an environmental protection specialist at the Department of Energy and the Environment (DOEE), said she felt let down last December after filing a sexual harassment complaint that she said was not taken seriously. She said she and a colleague were conducting an inspection at a D.C. police facility, standing outside with a sergeant, when another officer drove by and made crude comments at them, drawing a laugh from the sergeant. “It was really frustrating, because we really felt like obviously it wasn’t the most traumatizing experience — nothing physical happened. But if that’s how he’s interacting with us on the job, and that was clearly condoned by his colleague, how is he acting with the public?” Heller said. She and her colleague filed a complaint with DOEE, which took months to refer the matter to D.C. police — which ultimately found that there were “insufficient facts” to substantiate the women’s complaint, Heller said. On Tuesday, while she wondered if some of Bowser’s changes could make a positive impact, she said the responsibility lies more with management to take complaints seriously. “You want to feel safe, you want to feel supported by the organization, and I think taking these things seriously, having better response times, being more engaged” — those are the actions that would make a significant difference, she said. Spokespeople for D.C. police could not immediately be reached for comment late Tuesday afternoon. Two days after this story published online, DOEE Director Richard Jackson said in a statement that “the agency takes any allegation of sexual harassment very seriously,” but declined to comment on this specific case, saying the agency does not discuss personnel matters. While District officials apparently spent months drafting the new policy, it’s far from the end of the fallout of the Falcicchio scandal. For one, the D.C. Council voted in July to have the Office of Inspector General hire an outside firm to review the Mayor’s Office of Legal Counsel’s investigations into Falcicchio and probe any claims that fell outside the office’s jurisdiction, including retaliation. But in a council meeting in October, Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said the outside investigation had yet to get off the ground. In two separate requests for proposals, Mendelson said, the inspector general had trouble finding a local business subcontractor to partner on the contract, which District law requires for contracts over $250,000. The requirement was waived so the inspector general could move forward, and the council passed legislation extending the timeline for the investigation, which is now expected to go into 2024. D.C. Council members also pledged to use their oversight authority to probe the scope of sexual harassment among employees and review the District’s former sexual harassment policies for needed improvements. Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large) planned to hold a hearing Monday but postponed it to Nov. 14, and a spokesman said Bonds is looking forward to reviewing Bowser’s updated policy. Council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (I-At Large), whose committee has oversight of the Office of the Deputy Mayor of Planning and Economic Development, has not yet scheduled a hearing about that agency’s workplace culture. He said in a statement that ongoing active investigations — namely the outside probe expected to be launched by the inspector general — have complicated plans to conduct oversight. “We have significant overlap with the reviews that are underway by multiple entities on this matter,” McDuffie said, noting that he wants to move forward in a way that ensures “our scope does not impede the active investigations.” A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that former deputy mayor John Falcicchio resigned in May. He resigned in March. The article has been corrected.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/31/dc-bowser-sexual-harassment-policy-falcicchio/,Washington Post,2023-11-02 15:59:00,
"RIGA, Latvia — The loved ones of the drafted Russian soldiers forced to fight in Ukraine indefinitely have tried everything: They appealed to the Defense Ministry, wrote letters to President Vladimir Putin, met with many officials and even protested publicly. Their questions to Putin’s annual “direct line” call-in show for Russians last week were ignored. RIGA, Latvia — The loved ones of the drafted Russian soldiers forced to fight in Ukraine indefinitely have tried everything: They appealed to the Defense Ministry, wrote letters to President Vladimir Putin, met with many officials and even protested publicly. Their questions to Putin’s annual “direct line” call-in show for Russians last week were ignored. They mounted car sticker campaigns calling for the return of their husbands and sons, and crafted Christmas tree ornaments with the words, “Bring Papa home.” They posted impassioned video messages on social media. The Kremlin has rebuffed them. Yet they have emerged as the only wild card in Putin’s highly stage-managed election campaign that will allow him to rule until at least 2030. In this highly charged atmosphere, the Kremlin is determined to stifle any dissent, but there is no easy answer to women furious that their sons and husbands are being forced to fight on until the end of the war. Russian authorities have sent agents of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, to question soldiers whose wives are involved, according to an increasingly strident Telegram group, “The Way Home,” which is leading the campaign to bring men home. Military officers have threatened to send soldiers into front-line assault operations, unless they silence their wives, it reports. “Your methods are very dirty. You are trying to calm our anger by putting pressure on our relatives. Keep in mind that we can lose them at any moment. You are playing with their lives and ours,” according to a Dec. 19 post on the channel. “These are the obvious methods of cowards and rats.” A day earlier, the channel urged Putin to end the war “or go to the front yourself and die.” Putin took no questions from such women in his direct line show but dashed their hopes by ruling out a new round of mobilization that would allow exhausted contract and drafted soldiers — who have been fighting for a year or more — to go home. Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya, based in France, said that Putin’s decision was irreversible and seen as necessary to avoid the public furor that accompanied the 2022 call-up that mobilized at least 300,000 men for the war. “There will be no pity. And the Kremlin will try to keep them silent. And if there will be some more radicalized actions, they will resort to more repressive measures,” she said. A single mother of a soldier sent to fight in Ukraine more than a year ago against his will, said men were being sent “to slaughter” in suicidal battle missions, sometimes calling their wives beforehand to give their grim goodbyes. “I’m an ordinary village woman, and my son couldn’t even kill a chicken, and now all this has happened,” said the woman, whom The Washington Post is not identifying because she could be jailed for criticizing the military under Russia’s draconian censorship laws. “Every day you live in fear and worry. You live from one text message to another message,” she said. He and his unit “just can’t continue there; they don’t have any more strength.” He refused to follow an order to storm an enemy position and was kept in a squalid military prison for a week with others, she said. “I wrote letters to deputies and the president’s office. In response, we received only bureaucratic replies.” A soldier named Alexander, mobilized in the southern Russian city of Voronezh, posted a video on “The Way Home” this week while on a short military break, saying that all the mobilized soldiers wanted to go home. “Everyone’s very tired. So what? Nobody cares,” he said. “We don’t need anything. Just let us go home. Everyone wants to go home,” adding that military leaders could stretch out the war “for as long as you want.” As Putin exudes confidence, claiming that Ukraine and the West have failed to defeat Russia, he projects a victory just around the corner. Huge illuminated signs in Moscow read “Russia — country of victors.” Those who dissent are targets. “They pretend that we do not exist,” the mother said. “They call us traitors to the motherland. It makes you feel disappointment, resentment, annoyance and perhaps all the negative feelings. The question constantly arises ... How can we be treated like this?” U.S. intelligence estimates that 315,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded, but in Russia the numbers are secret and officials from Putin down are conveying the message that sending your son to Ukraine is patriotic and right. His recent orchestrated announcement that he would run for reelection involved several pro-war parents whose sons were killed in Ukraine, clamoring for him to run again. “It’s a signal that the Kremlin would like to send to the society that this is a behavior we would like to see from the society — that even these people who lost the most precious they have in their lives still stand by Putin,” Stanovaya said. At the ceremony for Putin’s campaign announcement, Maria Kostyuk, whose son died in the war, told the president that “our guys are on the front lines performing their duty, and we are in the rear, and our guys did not leave their front, so do not leave us.” She is employed by the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation, a state-backed body founded by Putin that promotes the war and is chaired by one of his relations. A 26-year-old woman from a small Russian city, with a young son, felt as though society was cracking apart when her husband was mobilized on Oct. 26, 2022. The woman, whom The Post is not identifying for security reasons, is a member of “The Way Home.” She said law-abiding people obeyed the mobilization order “and then the country betrayed them.” Meanwhile, she said, the sons of Russia’s elite were spared. “My husband’s mood is that, ‘We are here to the very end, and maybe we will never return.’ When he calls me, you can hear the explosions in the background, and it’s really frightening.” Clamping down on the women is delicate, Stanovaya said, with the Kremlin determined to maintain control but avoid a scandal and the impression that the federal government is cracking down. Regional governors were ordered to somehow make the women “disappear from informational space.” “If you try to send 100 policemen to arrest these women, it will make a lot of noise in the public space, so it’s not an option,” she said. Instead, a range of other methods have been deployed to undermine them. State television propagandists called them traitors and Nazi collaborators. Slick videos from rival groups of military women have condemned them. Olga Lesnova, a lawmaker in Ugra, in southern Russia, held classes for soldiers’ wives on “how to get rid of resentment toward the world.” Officials have infiltrated the Telegram channel, and FSB officials have questioned women about planned protests, according to “The Way Home.” But the 26-year-old member of the group said the efforts to stop them only made them more defiant. “Right now, nothing will stop us. Nothing can stop the women who have united because they have nothing to lose. Their men are facing such conditions that the women are not afraid of anything.” For the single mother whose son is at war, protest, once unthinkable, now seems a last desperate hope to save him. “I have not participated in rallies, street protests, but I think very soon I will agree to do so.” “I feel deceived,” she continued. “I realize that in any conflict all sides are to blame, but I have one question: When will those who are responsible for stopping this hell sit down at the negotiating table?”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/28/russia-military-wives-putin-reelection/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 01:30:00,

"The New York Jets are activating quarterback Aaron Rodgers from the injured reserve list, but he will not play in any games for the remainder of the season, Coach Robert Saleh said Wednesday. The procedural move allows Rodgers to continue practicing with the team. Rodgers’s 21-day practice window —   late last month — was expiring, so the team had to activate him from the IR list or officially end his season. If the Jets had not activated him, Rodgers would not have been permitted to continue practicing. The New York Jets are activating quarterback Aaron Rodgers from the injured reserve list, but he will not play in any games for the remainder of the season, Coach Robert Saleh said Wednesday. The procedural move allows Rodgers to continue practicing with the team. Rodgers’s 21-day practice window —   late last month — was expiring, so the team had to activate him from the IR list or officially end his season. If the Jets had not activated him, Rodgers would not have been permitted to continue practicing. “We’re still going to keep him on the active [roster],” Saleh said during a news conference Wednesday. “We’ve got the roster flexibility. … It’s all part of his rehab. And just having him out on the football [practice] field is a plus for everybody. It’s a plus for him. It’s a plus for his teammates.” Coach Saleh says that QB Aaron Rodgers will be added to the active roster to keep practicing as part of his rehab process.  Rodgers, who suffered a torn Achilles’ tendon in his left leg four offensive snaps   over the Buffalo Bills at MetLife Stadium, will take up a spot on the team’s 53-man roster and presumably will be on the game-day inactive list on a weekly basis. The Jets have been eliminated from playoff contention and face the Washington Commanders on Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J. Saleh made it clear Wednesday that there is no consideration of Rodgers playing in a game. “No,” Saleh said. “No, no, he’s not playing.” The Jets’ announcement came a day after Rodgers seemingly called off his attempt to play in a game again this season. He suggested during his regular appearance Tuesday on “The Pat McAfee Show” that he had turned his sights to returning to the Jets’ lineup next season and perhaps beyond. “I’m not going to slow my rehab down,” Rodgers said. “I’m going to keep attacking it every single day. But now, without a timetable to come back, obviously we can be as smart as we need to be.” ""I do feel like in the next three to four weeks it would be very possible to get to 100%.. If I was 100% today I'd definitely be pushing to play"" ~      Rodgers’s comments came two days after the Jets were eliminated  . He previously had said his bid to play again in the late stages of this season   on his health and on his team’s playoff chances. “I think the whole time it’s been hoping that we’re still in [the playoff race] because it was unrealistic to think that I would be 100 percent to be medically cleared at any point during the regular season,” Rodgers said. “I do feel like in the next three to four weeks, it would be very possible to get to 100 percent. But [I’m] obviously not there. … If I was 100 percent today, I’d be definitely pushing to play. But the fact is, I’m not.” Rodgers acknowledged Tuesday that he previously had targeted the Christmas Eve game against the Commanders for his return. He also said he has not practiced fully yet. He would have had to have done so, seen how his leg responded and then had a conversation with the Jets and surgeon Neal ElAttrache to decide whether he was going to play, Rodgers said. Rodgers, 40, said Tuesday that he does not expect next season to be his last in the NFL. The Jets acquired the four-time league MVP in an offseason trade  . “I wouldn’t have done anything differently,” he said. “I wanted to get back. Were we in a position where we were looking like a playoff team and the possibility of getting to the playoffs without me was going to happen, being ready for the first round of the playoffs to me would be an absolute no-brainer. I had kind of always circled the 24th in my head from the day I got hurt. … I feel good about where I’m at now to at least there would have been a conversation about it. But it was always going to be a difficult rehab and always going to be a difficult comeback.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/19/aaron-rodgers-not-returning/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 13:30:00,
"In 2013, his 15th year as the official hype man of the Maryland football team’s student section, Keith Moore, better known to Terrapins fans as “Special K,” talked about how he hoped to be remembered. “You build a bank account on what you get, but you will build a legacy on what you give,” Moore, who brought boundless enthusiasm to the sideline every Saturday while wearing his distinctive red cape and No. 99 jersey,  , Maryland’s student newspaper. “I hope and pray the spirit I’ve brought here will live forever.” In 2013, his 15th year as the official hype man of the Maryland football team’s student section, Keith Moore, better known to Terrapins fans as “Special K,” talked about how he hoped to be remembered. “You build a bank account on what you get, but you will build a legacy on what you give,” Moore, who brought boundless enthusiasm to the sideline every Saturday while wearing his distinctive red cape and No. 99 jersey,  , Maryland’s student newspaper. “I hope and pray the spirit I’ve brought here will live forever.” A decade later, the heartfelt remembrances of Moore from the Maryland community on social media after   this week suggest his spirit will live on in all who experienced his positive energy firsthand and jingled their keys to make some noise in response to his signature request whenever the Terps’ defense faced a third down: “Keys, please.” Moore died Saturday of a rare and aggressive form of skin cancer, Ashley Broadie, the oldest of his four children, told The Washington Post. He was 57. “It’s extremely overwhelming,” Broadie said of the response from Maryland fans and others who knew her father from his career in sales and as a motivational speaker or from his many years as a youth sports coach in Howard County. “My dad really did touch a lot of lives. … He was our soccer rec coach; he was our basketball coach; he was the hype man at our swim meets.” Moore, a Prince George’s County native and 1991 Maryland graduate, acquired his nickname before arriving on campus as a freshman in 1987. According to a  posted on the Maryland football website, it originated in high school, when Moore would announce games and hand out boxes of Kellogg’s Special K cereal for outstanding performances. At Maryland, Moore became involved with WMUC, the school’s student-run radio station. “You could tell early on that he was a talent,” said Ike Richman, a 1988 Maryland graduate who worked with Moore at WMUC, which he described as a family. “He was skilled, he was charismatic, he had an incredibly warm and friendly personality, he loved people, and he was just a fun guy to be around. He lit up the room.” Richman recalled the 25-hour WMUC “Jock-a-thon” Moore helped organize to raise money for Children’s National Hospital in Washington. The Diamondback reported that Moore, with a megaphone in hand, solicited donations from students waiting in line to get into popular Route 1 hangouts during the fundraiser by encouraging them to “give a buck.” “That’s who he was,” Richman said. “He decided, ‘I’m going to use my talent to help people.’” Moore worked as the microphone man for Maryland’s cheerleading squad during his undergraduate years and wore a tuxedo to every football game, according to a . He reprised his role as hype man once a season on homecoming after graduating in 1991. Then in 1999, the athletic department asked him to become a permanent fixture at games. With a red cape, a red hat, red shoes and a collection of signs with motivational phrases such as “We Believe!” Moore led the team onto the field and then led cheers throughout the game. He worked the sideline closest to the student section and was always upbeat, no matter the score or Maryland’s place in the standings. Moore’s cheers, including “Two times four is half of 16, all for Maryland, stand up and lean,” were legendary, as were his lighthearted jeers. “Go back, go back, go back into the woods” was about as mean-spirited as Moore got, and he did his best to temper the occasional vulgar chant that originated from the student section. “Special K was a riot because he was just kind of on his own,” said Jordan Baker, who was a sophomore when Moore returned to the Maryland sideline in 1999 and still pulls out his keys for third downs. “You had the band and all this other stuff going on, and he was just there on his little podium on the grass, all by himself, the hype man. It was like he just landed there. He’d lose his voice by the end of the game rallying the students. He was relentless, a highlight and just pure energy. … He was woven into the fabric of the game day experience.” The energy Moore brought to Maryland football Saturdays extended to his home life, his children said. “He made sure we knew what love was and to strive and put effort into everything and be positive,” Broadie said. “He made sure we knew that all the people around us have their own stories and everyone needs help in different ways.” Broadie, 33, and two of her younger siblings, Keegan Moore and Aubrey Moore, often joined their dad on the sideline as kids. “I helped make his signs, and he’d take me to the place where he got his cape embroidered,” Broadie said. “In high school and college, people would be like, ‘That’s your dad?!’” “I felt like his sidekick because I was with a superhero,” said Keegan Moore, who has vivid memories of his dad using his signs to protect him and his friends when students rushed the field after upsets of Florida State and Boston College. “That was my whole childhood. I would leave my football practice that he coached, and we would go to the Maryland game.” In 2001, Ralph Friedgen’s first year as Maryland coach, the Terps started 7-0 for the first time since 1978. The New York Times sent a reporter to College Park to document the excitement surrounding the team, which finished the season with 10 wins and an Orange Bowl berth. Naturally, Moore was quoted. “I was with this team through the dark ages, during the oppression,”  . “There were times when there was so much apathy and silence that people would give me funny looks. Now there are times when I don’t hear myself. And that’s a beautiful thing.” Maryland never repeated the success it enjoyed under Friedgen, who was fired after the 2010 season, but Moore continued to show up week after week, year after year. “Special K was a light!” former Terps wide receiver and two-time Super Bowl champion  . “No matter what was going on with the program he was always optimistic. The world lost a good man.” “His passion for Terps football was so genuine,” Maryland Coach Michael Locksley said in a statement. “Our players and our fans fed off his energy and he will be extremely missed.” Special K was a regular presence at Maryland football games until this season, when Moore’s declining health forced him to retire the role. “Saturdays at noon kept him going,” Keegan Moore said. “That was the time when he was able to be his 100 percent self in this world and electrify the crowd. As a kid, I always wanted him to get on ‘SportsCenter,’ but he’d say: ‘I don’t do this for me. I get those fans hype — that’s what gets me.’ ” Added Aubrey Moore, one of Keith’s three daughters: “He was everyone’s No. 1 fan. He didn’t forget anyone. He had a powerful spirit and a powerful way with words. He was brilliant, and he was wonderful.” Maryland will recognize Moore with a tribute video on the scoreboard during the second media timeout of the first quarter of Saturday’s game against Michigan. The Terps also will wear a helmet decal in his honor. “Keith lived his dream,” Richman said. “Nobody could do what he did. He made that position. He was something special — literally — and he will be remembered.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/17/keith-moore-special-k-maryland-football/,Washington Post,2023-11-17 08:30:00,
"CALGARY, Alberta — Making his first NHL start in nearly 20 months, Chris Driedger made 37 saves to backstop the Seattle Kraken to a 2-1 victory over the Calgary Flames on Wednesday night. “He was outstanding for us tonight, right from the first period through,” said Seattle coach Dave Hakstol. “A couple saves on the PK were difference-makers and he had to make one more for us right before the buzzer. Really happy for him. He’s worked hard to have that opportunity. He was a difference-maker for us tonight.” CALGARY, Alberta — Making his first NHL start in nearly 20 months, Chris Driedger made 37 saves to backstop the Seattle Kraken to a 2-1 victory over the Calgary Flames on Wednesday night. “He was outstanding for us tonight, right from the first period through,” said Seattle coach Dave Hakstol. “A couple saves on the PK were difference-makers and he had to make one more for us right before the buzzer. Really happy for him. He’s worked hard to have that opportunity. He was a difference-maker for us tonight.” Kailer Yamamoto and Alex Wennberg scored for Seattle (13-14-9). The Kraken extended their points streak to seven games (5-0-2) and moved ahead of Calgary in the Pacific Division standings. Nazem Kadri scored for Calgary (14-16-5). Making his fourth straight start for the Flames, Jacob Markstrom had 19 saves. After the conclusion of his first season with the Kraken, Driedger tore his ACL while playing for Canada in the gold medal game of the 2022 world championships. The resulting surgery sidelined him most of last season before he returned to action in late February with Seattle’s American Hockey League affiliate in Coachella, where he played for the rest of the season. “The most adversity I’ve ever faced in my career,” said Driedger, whose last NHL start was May 1, 2022. “It’s been a long road, lot of hours spent with the medical staff putting in hours when the guys are skating and doing my own thing and watching from the stands. To come out and finally get back in, it was pretty emotional.” His biggest stop, keeping the game tied, came on a Flames two-man advantage in the second period when he went from post to post to rob Elias Lindholm at the side of the net after he had been set up for a one-timer by a cross-crease pass from Connor Zary. “He did amazing,” said Wennberg. “He played games down there but it’s a different game up here and just making those big saves. He’s winning the game for us.” Tied at 1, the game-winner came off the stick of Wennberg six minutes into the third when he took a pass from Jared McCann and zipped a quick shot that beat Markstrom inside the post on the short side. Seattle opened the scoring 2:24 into the game on its first shot when Vince Dunn’s pass sprang Yamamoto on a breakaway. Kadri scored on the power play six minutes later. “You try to bear down in those situations, of course, we want to score and we want to capitalize on those opportunities,” said Kadri. “But at the same time, he made some great saves, timely saves to keep his team in it on the road.” It was Seattle’s 200th regular season game in franchise history. Defenseman Adam Larsson is the only player to have played in every one. At 304 consecutive games, Larsson has the league’s fifth-longest active Iron Man streak.

"LAS VEGAS — Jonquel Jones just wanted to show people who she really was — and that wasn’t happening. The 2021 MVP was part of the offseason reconstruction of the New York Liberty that also brought in Breanna Stewart and Courtney Vandersloot. With them on board, New York was expected to make the WNBA Finals — and did. LAS VEGAS — Jonquel Jones just wanted to show people who she really was — and that wasn’t happening. The 2021 MVP was part of the offseason reconstruction of the New York Liberty that also brought in Breanna Stewart and Courtney Vandersloot. With them on board, New York was expected to make the WNBA Finals — and did. But this season didn’t start so well for Jones. Her recovery from a foot injury suffered in the 2022 WNBA Finals slowed her transition. New York’s up-tempo scheme was different from what the 29-year-old forward experienced in six seasons with the Connecticut Sun. And off-the-court issues weighed heavily on Jones’s mind. All she wanted to do was prove to the organization and its fans that she was the elite player the Liberty had traded for in January. “This year has probably been the most adversity that I’ve faced on the court and off the court, too,” said Jones, who declined to get into the off-court specifics. “There were a lot of times when I would come home after games and stuff and just be really disappointed in just my level of play and just how I felt out there on the court. ... There were a lot of times where it just didn’t feel [right], but [I was] just sticking with it and not giving up.” The tough times didn’t last, and teammate Sabrina Ionescu got an up-close view of the progression. While in a front-row seat at the Las Vegas Aces’ brand-new practice facility last week, she paused while reflecting on Jones’s journey and noted the conversation was kind of awkward. A few feet away sat Jones, her 6-foot-6 frame sprawled out. “I’m not trying to talk about her when she’s right here,” Ionescu said with a smirk. But Ionescu didn’t have any issue speaking plainly with Jones during the first half of the season, when each day felt like a struggle. Jones wasn’t playing like her usual, dominant self. Not only did she seem a bit lost in the team’s system, but her numbers were down across the board in a way that went beyond simply having to share the stage in a stacked lineup. She failed to score in double figures in five of her first eight games. She didn’t reach double-digit rebounds until her 10th game. In 2022, she had been held to single-digit scoring six times in 33 regular season games. She had led the league in rebounds twice and last season ranked fourth. When this year’s all-star break arrived, she was averaging 10.3 points and 6.1 rebounds. “There’s beauty in the struggle, and she went through it,” Ionescu said. “And the only way she was going to get out of it is through it. So no one ever babied her. No one cut her any excuses. I was, obviously, understanding but have held her to a really high standard from the beginning because I knew what was going to unfold once she figured it out.” What unfolded was a post-all-star stretch in which Jones finally looked like herself. In her final 22 games, she averaged 12.2 points, 10.3 rebounds and 2.1 assists and shot 52.0 percent, posting nine double-doubles. In the playoffs, she has set a WNBA record with seven double-doubles, recording one in each of the Liberty’s games so far. Her aggressive rim protection has returned, too. Heading into the Finals, Jones may have been having the best postseason of anyone: In New York’s first six playoff games, she averaged 16.5 points, 12.8 rebounds and 2.2 blocks. She was back at it Sunday in  , when she had 12 points and nine rebounds before halftime. The Aces adjusted and held her to four points and one rebound in the second half to pull away for a 99-82 victory. Game 2 of the best-of-five series is Wednesday night. “At the end of the day, if she wants to shove people around and toss people around, she’s big enough, strong enough to do that,” Aces Coach Becky Hammon said. “So sometimes when we can send two bodies to help on her, yeah, we’re going to send two. But a lot of it is just doing early work when the shot comes up.” Added Aces center Kiah Stokes: “One of the keys to guarding her — if you could even guard her one-on-one — is just try not to let her touch the ball. … I was just trying to prevent her from getting those easy touches.” Little came easy for Jones during her first year in New York, but this sort of change was what she wanted. She was intrigued by the Liberty, its roster and its fans as she thought about her future. Jones spoke with Stewart and Vandersloot before the trade, envisioning what could be, and felt she would regret not jumping at the opportunity. That’s why Nesha Legania, Jones’s fiancée, didn’t want to influence her decision. Legania wanted Jones to make that choice on her own, before they got engaged in April. Both got what they wanted, but each had to deal with the adjustments that come with a major life change. At one point, Legania came home and could see in Jones’s eyes that something was wrong. She had seen Jones under pressure before, but this was different. Those hardships, Legania said, ended up being beneficial to them both. I can honestly say that that time was the best thing for our relationship,” Legania said. “We honestly were able to see each other in a different form. And to be able to be there with her and see that side of her and see the growth from there to now is just amazing. It’s a blessing to see us grow. Being able to be there [and] in it together is just a blessing in itself.” In some ways, the on-court challenges were offset by the positives of playing in a new, bigger city. Jones, a native of the Bahamas, has enjoyed exploring the restaurants — lots of Caribbean, Italian and Korean — as well as the galleries and other entertainment that New York offers. She has become close friends with teammates Jocelyn Willoughby, Kayla Thornton and Nyara Sabally, and having their support helped during those rough early days. Jones and Willoughby are avid readers and before practice Tuesday were discussing a book, “The Secret Lives of Church Ladies,” that the latter recommended. “Sometimes you need people to ... just say, ‘I see you; I recognize what you’re doing and the growth that you’re having,’ ” Willoughby said. “I tried to just give that positivity but also recognize and acknowledge [that], yes, it is hard. Individually, it’s really easy to focus on the negative. It’s like, ‘Oh, man, I’m not doing this, so I’m not here yet’ — especially when you have such high expectations of yourself as I know JJ does.” As the No. 6 pick of the 2016 draft out of George Washington, Jones knows she has been overlooked often. But by the time these Finals rolled around, many deemed her the determining factor for the Liberty. When she plays well and controls the glass, New York typically wins. “As we’re talking about the star power in this matchup … Jonquel often gets lost,” ESPN analyst LaChina Robinson said. “... How she shows up [is] huge for the Liberty.” Said Ionescu: “Without her, we’re not here.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/11/jonquel-jones-new-york-liberty-wnba-finals/,Washington Post,2023-10-11 05:30:00,

"Before the war, Plestia Alaqad didn’t think much about her Instagram feed. She posted a few photos of herself next to the Mediterranean, holding her friend’s son, petting her dog, Luki. She uploaded a photo of herself sitting in a cafe (“Happy and carefree era,” the caption read) and one from an early-morning bike ride (“Catch sunrises, not feelings”). Before the war, Plestia Alaqad didn’t think much about her Instagram feed. She posted a few photos of herself next to the Mediterranean, holding her friend’s son, petting her dog, Luki. She uploaded a photo of herself sitting in a cafe (“Happy and carefree era,” the caption read) and one from an early-morning bike ride (“Catch sunrises, not feelings”). When she imagined her future as a journalist, which was constantly, she thought about ways to bring the world’s attention to the Gaza she loved. But there was no rush. She was 21. There was time to figure out her career. Then she woke up on Oct. 7. On her phone, she scrolled through news stories and posts about Hamas’s attack in southern Israel. She considered how Israel might react, and what she should do next. She had graduated with a degree in new media and journalism in Cyprus a few months earlier. On Oct. 8, she was meant to start a job as a content creator for a Palestinian nongovernmental organization. Instead, Plestia began wandering the streets of Gaza and recording what she saw, posting videos and photos to Instagram and TikTok. She had about 3,700 followers on Instagram then, many of them friends and family members. On Oct. 9, she recorded a video as she walked through her building, showing how families were sheltering away from the windows. Then an enormous blast went off, sending a plume of dust and smoke into the air. “I was trying to explain things, but I think you can hear them now,” she says in the video. And then: “I’ll go check on my parents.” The world’s attention turned to Gaza during the early days of the war. But Israel’s blockade made it impossible for foreign journalists to enter. Palestinian reporters and photographers have been providing the only window into the carnage. All of a sudden, Plestia was one of the   documenting the biggest story in the world. On Oct. 9, she and her family fled their home in Gaza City and began sheltering in a hospital. The next day, she recorded a video as she went to check on what was left of their building. The street was covered in debris. She walked past ruined buildings before arriving at her own front door. Inside, she turned her camera to show the rubble. And then she tried to find a way to preserve some hope for her followers, and for herself. “It’s important to clarify that my house was not completely bombed,” she says in the video. “It can be fixed.” But not long after, she and her family fled Gaza City, heeding warnings from the Israel Defense Forces. Her uncle in the United Arab Emirates managed to get through to Plestia’s mother over the phone. He wanted to check on the family — but also to tell Plestia that her video had gone viral. She now had half a million Instagram followers. In her videos, Plestia was soon wearing a blue helmet and a protective vest that said “Press,” which she had borrowed from a local media organization. She was no longer only recording her own life, but documenting scenes of destruction and heroism from across Gaza. She began driving around with two other journalists  who filmed what they saw: 10-story buildings whose top floors had crumpled like newsprint; wounded children whose parents were missing (“If you know who they are or you are their parents, they are in the hospital,” she wrote). “Can you imagine that I lived my whole life here in Gaza and I can’t even recognize the streets right now?” she says in a video posted on Oct. 13. By then, she was getting hundreds of thousands of new followers a day. But there were also things she didn’t post. As more journalists were killed and as her profile rose, some of Plestia’s friends asked her to delete photos she had uploaded of them from before Oct. 7. She started to worry that if she was targeted, her family might be killed, too. “Should I go back to where my family is, or should I stay away from them? Am I being selfish?” she began to ask herself, she told The Washington Post in an interview. At the end of each day, her colleagues dropped her off at a cousin’s house where she and her family had sought shelter. She slept on a mattress on the floor. Her mother tried to cautiously talk her into staying inside. “How about you take a break?” she would say. When Plestia was growing up in Gaza, her mother, Rana, was constantly trying to shield her daughter from the horrors that sometimes descended on the Strip. When there was bombing, her mother would say, “It’s far away,” even if it wasn’t. Sometimes, when airstrikes began, her mom would insist that it was just a thunderstorm. Mostly, that strategy worked. Plestia loved growing up in Gaza. She modeled traditional Palestinian dresses and taught classes to other Palestinians at the Press House. She filled piles of notebooks with poems and diary entries. As the Israeli military campaign wore on, Plestia’s work continued. She filmed people baking bread on the floor of their homes after Gaza’s bakeries were bombed. She walked into an area where Palestinians were seeking refuge, and a group of children rushed to hug her. A few weeks into the war, she had more than 2 million followers, then 3 million. She considered the responsibility that came with that audience. But she was exhausted, barely sleeping, increasingly certain that she  . People began recognizing her in the streets  and asking her to tell their stories. One night, she walked into a hospital and saw a woman who had lost three of her limbs. Only one of her hands remained. Plestia introduced herself and explained that she wanted to document the woman’s injuries. “Oh, I follow you,” the woman said. Sometimes she would flick through her own Instagram feed and it felt as if she were looking into a stranger’s life. There was no sign of the Gaza she had known before the invasion. On Nov. 11, she wrote: “Most of my memories in Gaza are gone. My favorite restaurants, cafes, and stores all gone. Most of my friends’ houses all gone as well. For my house, I’m not sure if it’s partially demolished or if all of it is gone by now.” She tried to restore some balance to the version of Gaza she was documenting. She posted a video of a woman who had evacuated with three birds and two tiny turtles, one of whom she had named Plestia. Plestia’s aim was to share a more intimate glimpse into Gazan life. But the number of casualties soared. By early November, about 10,000 people had been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It was at around that time that Plestia learned her uncle had secured visas for the family in Australia. Once her name was placed on a list at the Rafah crossing, they would need to leave in 12 hours. Did she even have a choice? “I felt guilty. Why do I get to leave and others don’t?” she told The Post. “Why is it only people with passports or relatives abroad that can escape a war zone?” She thought about her mission to document Gaza, about leaving that mission behind. “But I decided I would feel more guilty if my family was killed because I decided to stay.” So she crossed into Egypt. A few days later, she was in southeastern Australia. For the first few days, it was difficult to look at the news. The chasm between the tranquility of her uncle’s house in Australia and the devastation in Gaza was too much to bear. But she needed to know what was happening. So she turned on her phone and began to scroll through the Instagram photos of those who had stayed behind.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/28/gaza-journalist-plestia-alaqad-instagram-palestine/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 03:00:00,
"Nearly half of the state lawmakers from Maryland’s largest county and about 1 in 4 statewide were not originally elected to their seats. Instead, they were appointed, sent to Annapolis by a handful of local party officials, according to a recent analysis from Common Cause Maryland, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for fair elections. Nearly half of the state lawmakers from Maryland’s largest county and about 1 in 4 statewide were not originally elected to their seats. Instead, they were appointed, sent to Annapolis by a handful of local party officials, according to a recent analysis from Common Cause Maryland, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for fair elections. And, with nine vacancies filled through appointments in the Maryland General Assembly this year and a 10th in the works, election advocates are renewing a push to change a process that they say concentrates power into the hands of people on elected but politically-connected local panels. That power should be in the hands of the voters, they say, and they are pushing for legislation that would send that question to voters in a referendum next November. Some lawmakers, including Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), support those efforts. Ferguson predicted there would be “real conversation” during the 2024 legislative session about changing the process, with an eye toward making it more democratic. “People are talking about it, a lot,” said Ferguson, who has supported past legislative efforts and expressed a desire in a recent interview to see the process changed. In Maryland, vacancies in the General Assembly are filled by locally elected party central committees, which forward a candidate’s name to the governor for final approval. Stand-ins, who must belong to the same party as the person they are replacing, then fill out the remainder of that person’s four-year term. “The General Assembly can’t continue to allow a handful of individuals to speak on behalf of thousands of voters,” Joanne Antoine, executive director of Common Cause Maryland, said of the process. About half of states across the country fill vacancies with special elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures — a process that is more costly and complex. Conversations about the appointment process also are underway  , where a committee makes a selection. While some detractors view the current process as antidemocratic, even they acknowledge that it has helped to increase diversity in the General Assembly. Among the Black lawmakers who were originally appointed to their current seats are House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County), House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s), and Senate Judicial Proceedings Chairman William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery). Smith was elected to the House of Delegates but appointed to fill a seat vacated by former senator Jamie Raskin. Still, Common Cause Maryland and Maryland PIRG say there should be special elections called to fill legislative vacancies, which is what happens in Maryland if there is an unexpected vacancy in the office of the comptroller, the attorney general or the U.S. Senate. “The current system is undemocratic; if anything, it is self-serving for political insiders,” Liza Smith, who serves on the 14th District Democratic Central Committee in Montgomery County, said in a statement. “When [such a large percentage] of the county legislative delegation has been appointed by a vote of 13 people on a party central committee, it is time to institute special elections to allow the people to vote to fill legislative vacancies.” But special elections are costly, one of the biggest arguments against revamping the process. They also can create unintended fundraising disadvantages for would-be candidates interested in filling seats. Under the current process, the party central committee in   on Monday recommended Del. Nick Charles (D-Prince George’s) to fill the seat vacated by former senator Melony Griffith. If approved by the governor, which is expected, then the committee will also have a say in who is appointed to fill Charles’s seat. If a special election were held to fill the Senate seat, anyone serving in the legislature who was interested in running would be at a financial disadvantage because they would be prohibited from fundraising during the 90-day session. “I think everybody sort of agrees that it’s not an ideal process as it exists today,” Ferguson said. “But the challenge is what do you do to fix it that doesn’t have a lot of unintended consequences and spinoff.” Sen. Clarence K. Lam (D-Howard) sponsored a bill that called for special elections in 2021. He said he anticipated that there could be newly reelected lawmakers who might resign to join the new governor’s administration. Five longtime lawmakers, including former senators Paul Pinksy, Susan Lee and former delegates Eric Luedtke, Kumar Barve and Kirill Reznik — resigned from their seats this year to join Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) administration. Their positions were filled through the appointment process. He said he thought of it as a “good government bill” because of the worry that voters would have a delegate or senator in office for almost four years whom they did not elect. “It just didn’t seem very fair to not reflect the will of the voters if fresh off of an election, they will be represented by someone that they did not elect for almost four years potentially,” Lam said. Last year Lam introduced a modified version of the bill, one that would have allowed for appointments but also created special elections which would have been held during presidential elections. The bill never made it out of the Maryland House Ways and Means Committee. House Ways and Means Committee Vice Chairwoman Jheanelle K. Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who chairs the committee’s election law subcommittee, said figuring out the best way to change the process is the most difficult challenge. “We are definitely going to take a look at any piece of legislation dealing with vacancies and work to address this issue,” said Wilkins, who was originally appointed to her seat. “What we’re seeing in the House is a deliberative process around how do we make this as fair as possible; how do we balance what we’re hearing from voters in terms of how we would like to see these vacancies filled? … We have to figure out the best way to move forward and address the concerns of the voters and ensure that we have a representative democracy.” Lam said he’ll try again in the upcoming session, which starts in January. Under the bill, depending on timing, an appointee could be in place for as long as two years but then he or she would have to run for election. “It’s not ideal, but I think that it’s at least a good start,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/26/appointments-maryland-general-assembly/,Washington Post,2023-11-26 16:36:00,

Ja Morant’s nearly eight-month exile from the NBA is on track to end Tuesday, when the Memphis Grizzlies star is expected to face the New Orleans Pelicans after completing the terms of a 25-game suspension for flashing a gun on an Instagram live stream. The last time the 24-year-old guard took the court, in April, a once-promising Grizzlies campaign combusted in the first round of the playoffs following a string of injuries and Morant’s previous gun-related suspension, which  . Now Morant returns to a reshaped Grizzlies team that has lost several key players and sits near the bottom of the Western Conference standings with a 6-17 record entering Friday night. With so much ground to make up, Morant faces the possibility his two suspensions will have ruined two seasons for Memphis. In his first public comments since  , Morant said Friday he “made a lot of mistakes,” did “a lot of learning” and participated in “eye-opening” therapy sessions during his extended hiatus, which he said was “definitely tough” to go through and included some “horrible days.” “Basketball is something I’ve been doing pretty much my whole life and something that’s therapeutic for me,” Morant said at a news conference in Memphis. “Taking that away makes it tougher. I had the right people around me, from my family to the organization to my other partners. My only message [to the fans] is that I’m just as excited to see them when that time comes.” Morant added that his focus has been “protecting my peace” and “doing whatever makes me happy and keeps me in a good mood.” To retake the court, Morant was required to complete a return-to-play process that included several checkpoints, among them a meeting this week with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who said Saturday he and the National Basketball Players Association had been “monitoring the situation closely.” “To the best of my knowledge, [Morant] has complied with everything he’s been asked to do,” Silver said. Morant kept a relatively low profile throughout his second suspension, which came on the heels of allegations Morant and his friends   and   This week, Morant appeared in court for a hearing related to the alleged fight with the teenager over a pickup basketball game in July 2022. In recent months, Morant was cleared to practice and travel with his Grizzlies teammates, and he appeared on social media in workout videos wearing T-shirts that read “Accountability” and “Gratitude.” After a March incident in which he   on social media and the June incident in which he  , Morant acknowledged he has a lot of trust to earn back. “I can’t make nobody believe me outside of my actions,” Morant said. “Me answering this question with just words probably won’t mean nothing to nobody. … I wouldn’t say I regret [the situation], but I’m not happy that it happened. But I’m also grateful that I had this opportunity to reflect and do things that I think were not only needed for me but for my family as well, to realize what all is at stake. … I can’t say I sit up here and regret it because in the end it made me better.” A two-time all-star and a budding face of the NBA before his suspensions, Morant led the Grizzlies to the playoffs in each of the past three seasons, and Memphis, despite a young core, was the West’s No. 2 seed last season. Yet Morant’s fall from grace coincided with major changes this summer: Marcus Smart and Derrick Rose replaced Dillon Brooks and Tyus Jones, who were two key rotation players on last year’s team. Memphis proceeded to start 1-8 without Morant, center Steven Adams (who underwent season-ending knee surgery in October) and backup big man Brandon Clarke (who is still sidelined with an Achilles’ injury). The Grizzlies, who featured in a marquee Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors last season, have retreated from the national radar without their franchise player. Memphis’s ugly start included   about the officiating following a Nov. 10 loss to the Utah Jazz, and Morant, who averaged 26.2 points, 8.1 assists and 5.9 rebounds last season, will need to kick-start an offense that ranks 29th this season after finishing 11th in 2022-23 and fourth in 2021-22. “There’s definitely some guilt in that,” Morant said when asked about the impact of his absence. “I’m not on the floor, and nobody likes losing. Our job is to go out there and get a win. I take full responsibility for that.” Memphis entered play Friday 6½ games out of the West’s play-in tournament and eight games out of a guaranteed playoff spot.   gives the Grizzlies a 0.3 percent chance of making the playoffs, while   the team to win just 25.7 games with no chance to make even the play-in tournament. “As far as where we stand, I’m not worried at all,” Morant said. “We’ve had guys out. We’ve been preaching over the years that ‘Next man up’ mentality. I don’t think it will be long before we find it. I feel like we’re taking strides in the right direction as of late. I feel like the only way for us to go is up.” The Grizzlies have had no choice but to remain patient during the first two months of the season, and   to the “lengthy” return-to-play process. The coach noted his floor general has been increasingly involved in practices and in five-on-five scrimmages in preparation for his season debut, which will be a showdown between New Orleans’s Zion Williamson and Morant, the top two picks in the 2019 draft. Though Morant said he has been “counting down the days” until his suspension is lifted, he cautioned he wasn’t going to “force a historic game my first game back” or attempt to project a different image following the controversies. “I honestly feel like I can’t go away from being Ja,” he said. “That’s the most important thing. Not trying to lose myself or be somebody that I’m not or act totally different. The change will be my decision-making and how I go about my daily life of being an NBA player, a father, a role model, a brother and a son.

"Given his unparalleled ability to accumulate value as a hitter and a pitcher, it probably will be more surprising when Shohei Ohtani is not deemed the most valuable player in his league than when he is. After it took a record-breaking season for Aaron Judge to best him last season, Ohtani was again named the unanimous American League MVP in 2023 after hitting 44 homers and striking out 167 batters for the Los Angeles Angels. Given his unparalleled ability to accumulate value as a hitter and a pitcher, it probably will be more surprising when Shohei Ohtani is not deemed the most valuable player in his league than when he is. After it took a record-breaking season for Aaron Judge to best him last season, Ohtani was again named the unanimous American League MVP in 2023 after hitting 44 homers and striking out 167 batters for the Los Angeles Angels. The only real threat to his candidacy was the fact that he did not pitch during August and September because of injury and did not hit for the last few weeks of the season, either. But like he did in 2021 and with the rookie of the year award in 2018, Ohtani ran away with the award anyway. He became the first player to win more than one MVP award unanimously. “Obviously I wanted to win it last year, but Judge had a spectacular season, and deservedly so, he won it,” Ohtani said on MLB Network through Angels interpreter Ippei Mizuhara. “. . . My goal was to come out on top, and I guess it kind of pays off, all my hard work.” The man who won the National League rookie of the year in 2018, Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr., again shared an award with Ohtani as he was named NL MVP — also unanimously, the first time in a voting process that began in 1931 that both MVP winners were so convincing. Ohtani’s magical season began in March at the World Baseball Classic, where the two-way star closed out a championship  . He was compiling a Cy Young caliber pitching season with a 3.14 ERA in 23 starts before an elbow injury ended his pitching season. As a hitter, he batted .304 with 44 homers and a 1.066 OPS. By late July, he and the Angels were still in the race for a postseason berth, enough that they bought at the trade deadline for the first time in Ohtani’s tenure. Within a month, they had placed almost everyone they acquired on waivers, ending their last chance to make the postseason before he became a free agent. Ohtani’s season as a hitter ended a few days later, and he  . The 29-year-old is the most coveted free agent of this offseason — and perhaps in history — though he will not pitch in 2024. Ohtani, who had not otherwise spoken publicly to American reporters since early August, was supposed to address reporters after the ceremony Thursday night. A half-hour after his call was scheduled, an MLB official said the call would be canceled because of circumstances beyond Ohtani’s control, emphasizing it was “not Shohei’s fault in the least.” Acuña also missed his scheduled call with baseball media but for a wholly different reason:  He was taking the field for a game with Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Winter League. He joins Miguel Cabrera and Jose Altuve as the only Venezuelan-born players to win the award. The Braves outfielder  that seemed likely to become his norm before a knee injury derailed his trajectory two years ago. He became the fifth player in MLB history to hit 40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same season and led the majors with 73 stolen bases, 19 more than the next closest player. He hit .337 with 41 homers and a 1.012 OPS.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/16/shohei-ohtani-ronald-acuna-jr-mlb-mvps/,Washington Post,2023-11-16 18:57:00,
"COLUMBUS, Ohio — For much of the rainy MLS Cup at the Columbus Crew’s gold-splashed palace, there was a greater sense of coronation than tension. The hungry hosts scored twice in the first half Saturday, and with Los Angeles FC flashing few of the elements that had positioned it for a possible repeat championship, the Crew seemed certain to raise the trophy for a third time. COLUMBUS, Ohio — For much of the rainy MLS Cup at the Columbus Crew’s gold-splashed palace, there was a greater sense of coronation than tension. The hungry hosts scored twice in the first half Saturday, and with Los Angeles FC flashing few of the elements that had positioned it for a possible repeat championship, the Crew seemed certain to raise the trophy for a third time. But finals are almost never this easy, and when the final whistle broke a tension-cooked stretch run unfurling in heavy rain, the Crew and its record crowd at Lower.com Field celebrated a 2-1 thriller. “I cried like a baby,” said Cucho Hernández, the game MVP. Columbus, an MLS founding member, won the title for the second time in four seasons while denying LAFC’s attempt to become the first repeat champion since the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2011-12. Hernández and Yaw Yeboah scored four minutes apart, and Columbus survived a whirlwind finish, including Dénis Bouanga’s 74th-minute goal and seven minutes of stoppage time, before a raucous audience of 20,802. “I want to see my team face and embrace adversity, and they did it,” said Wilfried Nancy, Columbus’s first-year coach. Implementing its possession game, the Crew put its stamp on the match right away. Captain Darlington Nagbe was the guiding light, orchestrating from central midfield and calming his team in anxious moments. He became a four-time champion — his second with the Crew after one apiece in Portland and Atlanta. Nagbe, 33, set the tone in the pregame locker room by giving an emotional speech about the team’s journey. “Everybody was crying because he is genuine,” Nancy said. “It was mostly about telling each other how proud I am of them and how I need them,” Nagbe said. “We all need each other.” Aidan Morris, Nagbe’s partner in central midfield, said of Nagbe, “Everything that comes out of this guy’s mouth, it’s just special to me.” Nancy did his part as well. He had collected photos of all the players when they were young and held them up before the match. “We had a good laugh,” Nancy said. “Just to see where you’re coming from and where you want to get to, it was motivating,” Yeboah said. “It put a smile on your face; we were laughing at each other. Seeing my picture, it was emotional.” Nagbe added: “That kind of broke the ice. That’s what Wilfried does, not only on the technical side but making sure he’s managing the guys right and then putting guys in the right mind frame.” Nancy became the first Black coach to win an MLS title in the league’s 28 seasons. “I’m so proud, but I’m not happy at the same time because this is not normal,” he said. “Simple as that. It’s something that has to change. I know MLS is trying to do that. This is not only in MLS. This is everywhere.” Emotions surfaced hours before the match as Columbus supporters began gathering at the breweries and restaurants within walking distance of the stadium. A river of black and gold flowed down the boulevard and emptied at the gates. Several hundred LAFC fans, led by actor Will Ferrell, a team investor, made the trip — and made their presence known in several upper-level sections. The energy radiated by dueling supporters’ groups at either end created a fun house for the senses and forged a world-class atmosphere. Buoyed by the crowd, the Crew was on its front foot from the start. Its possession game kept LAFC locked in its own end. LAFC is most dangerous on the counterattack, but with limited possession, serious threats were scant. Columbus’s breakthrough came from the penalty spot in the 33rd minute after Diego Palacios’s handball. Hernández converted into the low left corner for his fifth goal of the playoffs. Moments later, amid a sudden deluge of rain, Malte Amundsen delivered a wonderful pass from the center circle to Yeboah making a run behind Ryan Hollingshead. As goalkeeper Maxime Crépeau came off his line, Yeboah slid it past him for his first goal in more than five months. Crew goalkeeper Patrick Schulte described the pass as “picture perfect.” LAFC Coach Steve Cherundolo lamented his team’s mistakes. “We didn’t perform well enough to recover from those errors, which we don’t normally make,” he said. Columbus dodged an own-goal scare in the final seconds of the half. When the second half began, the Crew was on the prowl for the knockout punch. With LAFC committing more players forward, Columbus salivated at the counterattacking opportunities. Palacios headed Yeboah’s threat off the goal line. LAFC was teetering. The Crew’s defensive work on Bouanga was close to immaculate. The runner-up for MLS regular season MVP — FC Cincinnati’s   — was largely a non-factor on the left flank. Midway through the second half, though, Columbus began to show cracks. LAFC’s Jesús Murillo disrupted a Columbus possession and crossed to Bouanga. Schulte made a sensational save — with his hands and jaw — but Bouanga banged in the rebound. The pressure did not let up. Columbus did have chances to restore the two-goal lead, but LAFC survived. The Crew’s collective stress grew. The final whistle brought comfort and joy. Columbus players fell to their knees and teammates rushed from the sideline, oblivious to the unruly weather.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/09/mls-cup-columbus-crew-lafc/,Washington Post,2023-12-09 21:17:00,
"BERLIN, N.H. —   had talked about a litany of issues America is confronting today — including fentanyl, inflation and wars abroad — before an audience member at a town hall here Wednesday raised his hand to question the Republican presidential candidate about a 162-year-old event. “What was the cause of the United States Civil War?” the man asked Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor who is campaigning this week in this key early primary state. BERLIN, N.H. —   had talked about a litany of issues America is confronting today — including fentanyl, inflation and wars abroad — before an audience member at a town hall here Wednesday raised his hand to question the Republican presidential candidate about a 162-year-old event. “What was the cause of the United States Civil War?” the man asked Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor who is campaigning this week in this key early primary state. Haley’s answer did not include any mention of slavery, which scholars agree was the main driver of the conflict. It prompted surprise from her questioner and swift criticism and rebuttals from Democrats and Republicans beyond New Hampshire,  . It also resurfaced Haley’s previous comments that the war was the result of disagreements over “tradition versus change.” (On Thursday morning, hours after the exchange,  ) At first, when she heard the question, Haley appeared caught off guard. The recreation room in this northernmost city in New Hampshire, a place that has leaned red in recent elections, grew quiet, and Haley looked at the man dressed in a plaid shirt who stood behind his sons seated in the back row. She paused and responded, “Well, don’t come with an easy question.” Then she proceeded to answer. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do,” Haley said. She then turned the question to the man who asked it: “What do you think the cause of the Civil War was?” The man responded that he is not   and wanted to hear her thoughts. “I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,” Haley continued. “And I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn’t need to tell you how to live your life. They don’t need to tell you what you can and can’t do. They don’t need to be a part of your life.” The man then responded, “In the year 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you answer that question without mentioning the word slavery.” Haley quickly replied with a question: “What do you want me to say about slavery?” The man said, “You’ve answered my question, thank you.” Haley replied, “Next question.” Haley on Thursday acknowledged the Civil War was “about slavery,” after facing a backlash for not mentioning it on the previous day. “Of course the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That’s the easy part of it,” the Republican presidential candidate said on “The Pulse of NH,” a local radio show. ""I want to nip it in the bud. Yes, we know the Civil War was about slavery. But more than that, what’s the lesson in all this?” she added. “That freedom matters. And individual rights and liberties matter for all people. That’s the blessing of America. That was a stain on America when we had slavery. But what we want is never relive it. Never let anyone take those freedoms away again.” The voter who asked the question declined to share his name when asked by The Washington Post. He later told reporters that he had asked the question because he saw her answer such a question when she was running for governor of South Carolina and he was curious if she would provide the same response in New Hampshire. When Haley ran for governor of South Carolina in 2010, she addressed the Civil War during a private meeting with two leaders of Confederate heritage groups. She called it a fight between “tradition” and “change.” “You see passions on different sides,” she said at the time. during comments that were captured on video and  . “I don’t think anyone does anything out of hate.” The man who asked the question said he thought her reply reflected her previous comments and he wasn’t surprised by it. He declined to share his party affiliation or any information about his  political beliefs. He added that he thought she was an accomplished and smart woman and her staff was respectful. Scholars agree that a dispute over slavery was central to causing the Civil War, said James Grossman, the executive director of the American Historical Association. He added that while Haley’s answer reflects the seceding Southern states’ argument that their rights were infringed, she leaves out that the states wanted to protect the institution of slavery. He also said it was inaccurate to say the government was infringing on everyone’s rights rather than some enslavers’ so-called freedom. “The problem is that the quote-unquote rights to which she’s referring are the rights of some people to own other humans,” he said. Biden took to social media Wednesday night to call attention to Haley’s exchange. “It was about slavery,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. After the event, some attendees told The Post that they thought Haley answered the question to the best of her ability and they accused the man who asked the question of intending to cause trouble. One audience member heckled the man when he said he wasn’t running for president, saying that was a good thing. Trump dominated here in this northern county in the last contested Republican primary in 2016 and holds a wide lead in polls of the GOP race in New Hampshire, with Haley gaining ground on him in a distant second. Several attendees said they were considering Trump or Haley in next month’s primary. Vickie Plourde, who said she was undecided  before the event, said she had been  persuaded to vote for Haley after the town hall. She said the question was a setup. “We have to move past that,” she said of slavery. “If we continue to look in the past and say ‘Look, look, look, look,’ and we’re not moving forward, we’re going to stay back there.” Race has historically been a delicate issue for Haley. After a white supremacist killed nine people attending Bible study at a historically Black church in Charleston in 2015,   from the State House grounds. In 2010, she suggested that she would not make such a move and was well-equipped to challenge an NAACP-boycott of the state over the flag  because of her status as a woman of color. “I don’t have any intentions of bringing it back up or making it an issue,” she told the leaders of the Confederate heritage groups. “I’m the perfect person to deal with the boycott because as a minority female, I’m going to talk to them and I’m going to go and let them know that every state has different conditions and every state has certain things that they hold as part of their heritage.” Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison referenced some of those comments as he criticized Haley’s remarks Wednesday night. “Same person who said the confederate flag was about tradition & heritage and as a minority woman she was the right person to defend keeping it on state house grounds,” he wrote on  X. “Some may have forgotten but I haven’t. Time to take off the rose colored Nikki Haley glasses folks.” The presidential campaign of Florida Gov.  , which has been trading attacks with Haley, amplified her comments on Wednesday evening, sharing video on X and  her omission of slavery inexplicable. DeSantis and his allies have been attacking Haley mostly from the right, charging that she is insufficiently conservative. But they have also criticized her as inconsistent, and some allies of the governor have predicted that growing scrutiny of Haley would hurt her with moderate voters as well as the party’s base. DeSantis has also faced blowback to his approach to race and the history of slavery and discrimination in the United States. His administration barred an Advanced Placement African American studies course, objecting to some of its content, and was widely criticized for slavery education standards that called for instruction on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” DeSantis defended the moves and said they were misconstrued.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/27/nikki-haley-slavery-civil-war/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 11:11:00,

Melinda Bolling, who Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) tapped earlier this year to lead the District’s Department of For-Hire Vehicles, withdrew from consideration Wednesday after the D.C. Council signaled it would vote to reject her nomination. Bolling was a familiar face among the D.C. government’s leadership ranks even before Bowser named her as the DFHV’s acting director in  : She led the agency once known as the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (which  into two agencies last year) between 2015 and 2018 before taking the top job at a similar agency in Prince George’s County. But at the time of her departure, Bolling was the subject of a whistleblower lawsuit, and her leadership at DCRA had been   by city lawmakers who cited complaints about a lack of transparency as well as the agency’s failure to crack down on vacant properties and illegal construction. Those same concerns were raised this week by Council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), who chairs the committee tasked with giving initial consideration of Bolling’s permanent appointment to the DFHV. The agency, tasked with regulating vehicles for hire, including taxis, is a Cabinet-level agency that until   was known as the D.C. Taxicab Commission. It experienced some  a decade ago as companies like Uber and Lyft entered the marketplace. It is uncommon for a mayoral nominee to be rejected by the D.C. Council. In December, Bowser’s choice to lead the much-criticized Office of Unified Communications, Karima Holmes, similarly pulled out consideration for the permanent job one day before a vote from the full council, noting that it appeared members had enough votes to oust her. In a draft report circulated to the entire council Tuesday, Nadeau said her committee planned to recommend rejecting Bolling’s nomination ahead of a vote before the full council next week. “The Committee believes that past performance need not mar one’s record in perpetuity. However, a rebuilding a record of performance and trust should not start by being newly confirmed as an agency director,” the report says. “The Committee is not arguing that Melinda Bolling does not deserve a place within D.C. government. However, at this time we cannot recommend that place be in the Mayor’s cabinet.” The report dinged Bolling for several incidents during her time at DCRA, from concerns related to her responsiveness to the council to her handling of public complaints. In one example, the committee cited a 2017 oversight hearing where council members noted Bolling had neglected for months to respond to certain information requests from the council. The committee also pointed to a report from the D.C. auditor on DCRA’s handling of vacant and blighted properties, which identified “significant” weaknesses from fiscal 2015 including instances where vacancy notices were never sent after an inspection. The committee also noted issues with records management detailed   by D.C.'s Office of Open Government, which found DCRA was improperly requiring residents to pay for records that should have been publicly disclosed on DCRA’s website. Bolling responded that no one on her staff was aware of the mandatory disclosure requirement. Bolling also was the subject of a whistleblower lawsuit in 2018 brought by a Freedom of Information Act officer at the DCRA, who said Bolling provided little training to officers and flouted deadlines, and unjustly terminated them after they voiced concerns. The   and  reported earlier this year that the case was settled for $200,000. When Bowser named Bolling as acting director, Bolling told reporters that she was happy with her performance at DCRA and referred questions about the lawsuit to the Office of the Attorney General. Several people testified in support of Bolling’s nomination Wednesday at a D.C. Council roundtable, speaking positively about her leadership skills and knowledge of the city’s government. In her own testimony, Bolling spoke to steps she has taken since joining the DFHV in March and a plan to galvanize the taxi industry and bring back more drivers. But toward the end, Bolling said she was aware of the disapproval resolution and had asked Bowser to withdraw her nomination. The mayor did that Wednesday in a formal request to D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson (D). “The for-hire industry has many challenges, and I am honored that Mayor Bowser saw in my experience someone who could lead this agency and its very capable staff toward innovative solutions to these complex problems. I regret that you do not,” Bolling said to Nadeau. “I’d looked forward to working with Mayor Bowser, her administration and you to serve this city, but I’ve asked the mayor to withdraw my nomination.” In a statement, Bowser said Bolling is “an extraordinary public servant with a track record of success in DC Government. She continues to be a passionate and innovative leader who we are proud to have on the team.” A mayoral spokesperson did not clarify whether Bolling would remain in D.C. government. Bolling referred to Bowser’s statement when asked for comment. Nadeau in a statement said she appreciated that Bolling made a case for herself, adding that oversight is a “critical role the council plays in protecting the interests of D.C. residents and taxpayers.” “Committee members agree that we need to be able to trust that agency heads will be responsive to the Council [to] share requested information. That trust is essential to our oversight role,” Nadeau said. “I shared my concerns and our plans to disapprove the nomination with Ms. Bolling and members of the mayor’s team and I think they ultimately came to understand our concerns.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/02/dc-bowser-bolling-taxis-consumer-regulatory-affairs/,Washington Post,2023-11-02 19:59:00,

"LAS VEGAS — A’ja Wilson has a pregame routine. After the Las Vegas Aces center finishes her warmups, she strides out to half court, then sprints off the floor and up the tunnel to the locker room. On Wednesday night, Wilson — and the Aces — continued that sprint through the first quarter of Game 2 of the WNBA Finals against the New York Liberty. LAS VEGAS — A’ja Wilson has a pregame routine. After the Las Vegas Aces center finishes her warmups, she strides out to half court, then sprints off the floor and up the tunnel to the locker room. On Wednesday night, Wilson — and the Aces — continued that sprint through the first quarter of Game 2 of the WNBA Finals against the New York Liberty. Wilson powered her team to a 17-point first-quarter lead and the Aces survived a second-quarter push from the Liberty before reestablishing control and rolling to a 104-76 win and a 2-0 series lead. Wilson finished with 26 points and 15 rebounds. The series shifts to New York for Game 3 on Sunday as the Aces, 7-0 this postseason, look to become the first team to win back-to-back titles since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001-02. The Game 2 defeat marked the first time the Liberty lost consecutive games all season. “They don’t leave me speechless very often,” Aces Coach Becky Hammon said. “They’re the real deal. They’re the real deal. … Those girls hooped today. Just hooped.” Wilson became the first player in Finals history to post multiple games of 25-plus points and 10-plus rebounds — she had 26 and 10 in Game 1. Kelsey Plum scored 23 for the Aces, and Jackie Young added 24 points, eight rebounds and four assists. Point guard Chelsea Gray contributed 14 points and 11 assists, putting her No. 2 on the all-time WNBA Finals assists list.  was the lone consistent threat for the Liberty with 22 points and 10 rebounds. Breanna Stewart finished with 14 points and 13 rebounds. The Aces came out of the gate with the greatest offensive first quarter in WNBA Finals history. It started quickly with a three-pointer from Plum, but that certainly wasn’t out of the ordinary. But when Kiah Stokes, who was 5 for 27 from behind the arc during the regular season, followed with one from the corner and another to give the Aces a 19-2 lead, it felt like the game would be decided before halftime. We didn’t really execute anything we wanted to,” Liberty Coach Sandy Brondello said. “Everything was too easy. We wanted physicality. We wanted to be disruptive. ... We didn’t have any toughness. Their movement, obviously they move extremely well. That was tough for us. They passed the ball extremely well. They’ve got playmakers everywhere, but we had no resistance. And that’s what I’m disappointed about, is that we didn’t compete.” All five Aces starters hit a three-pointer in that first quarter, just the second time in Finals history that every starter made a three-pointer. The Aces needed just 10 minutes to do so as they led 38-19 at the end of the first. That total marked the most points Las Vegas scored in a single quarter all season. The Aces shot 70 percent from the field and 60 percent from behind the arc while New York shot just 30 percent. As the Aces were putting on an offensive clinic, New York looked lost and started just 2 for 13 from the field. The Liberty was in danger of losing control of the series before halftime, but Jones steadied things with a dominant second quarter. Jones scored nine points during a 12-0 run that cut the lead to six and helped New York trail just 52-44 at halftime. She scored 16 points and grabbed eight rebounds in the second quarter alone and had 19 points and 10 rebounds at halftime, recording her WNBA-record eighth double-double in a single postgame. New York was not able to maintain that momentum, however. The Aces opened the third with a 17-3 run led by Wilson and Young and never looked back. They led 80-57 at the end of the third and now are closing in on another title. It’s disappointing,” Stewart said. “Obviously, we still have a lot of basketball that’s left to be played, but this is the Finals and there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be ready to go from the start of the game to the start of the third quarter. We keep putting ourselves in these positions where we have to fight back and you need to do better and we need to take a look from within and figure it out.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/11/aces-liberty-wnba-finals/,Washington Post,2023-10-12 00:01:00,
"Play too much with rage, and rage will char you. Rage also will char everyone in your vicinity — enemy, ally or bystander — because it cannot be controlled.

Play too much with rage, and rage will char you. Rage also will char everyone in your vicinity — enemy, ally or bystander — because it cannot be controlled. Draymond Green used to play with edge, with nastiness and purpose. Now he just rages. Basketball IQ, charred. Situational awareness, charred. Dependability, charred. What remains of the Golden State Warriors’ dynasty felt this burn, too. There may not be anything distinguishable left. If so, it’s a sad and troubling way for its greatness to conclude. Fourteen months ago, the Warriors were still aglow after winning  . Then Green   during a preseason practice, triggering a series of violent, impulsive acts the Warriors enabled with their feckless attempts at discipline. Now the Draymond problem has escalated into a crisis at a time when the Warriors have never needed him more. The NBA stepped in late Wednesday night and handed Green   after he swung wildly and struck the head of Phoenix Suns center Jusuf Nurkic. “Personally, I feel like that brother needs help,”  . Just a month ago, the NBA   for putting Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert in a chokehold. In the first round of the playoffs last season, the league   for stomping on the chest of Sacramento Kings center Domantas Sabonis. And there are a dozen outbursts and near skirmishes over the past year that qualify as typical for Green and tend to get overlooked. He is allowed more leeway than any player, yet he still lives in the principal’s office. After every punishment, the NBA tried to warn Green, articulating that he was being punished for repeated inappropriate behavior. After every punishment, Green showed fleeting remorse and then scoffed when asked whether he would change. Just like those nights when he keeps badgering referees even after he has received one technical foul, Green refused to stop until someone dared to stop him. In theory, he won’t be able to play basketball again until he works on himself and gets the proper assistance to resolve some of his aggressive impulsivity and anger management issues. We all know, however, that such a process takes more time than Golden State, 10-14 and reeling entering Saturday, has to salvage this season. He should be gone at least two weeks, but after his absence reaches eight games or so, the benchmark probably will be downgraded to an evaluation of whether he has done just enough to stem the bad optics that rankle the league. Yet if there is any lesson from  , it’s the ineffectiveness of superficial discipline. Morant went away last season to work on his issues, supposedly, and he returned eight games later, right on time for the playoffs, only to engage in   as soon as his postseason ended. He made the league regret trusting that he had learned from his mistakes. So NBA Commissioner Adam Silver responded with   to start this season, one that has left a playoff Memphis Grizzlies team with one of the league’s worst records. While the cases of Morant and Green are vastly different, the difficulty juggling justice, rehabilitation and a franchise’s hopes presents a similar conundrum. This time, the NBA should be motivated to make Green do extra to convince them he can play basketball without morphing into a pro wrestling villain. Green should have to sit for a painfully long time and complete thorough reentry criteria because everyone will look like indifferent — or, worse, weak — fools if Green makes a swift return and immediately reverts to uncivil behavior. For inspiration to stay the course, the league needs only to look at the Warriors’ mollification of nearly every Green controversy. Again and again, Golden State has tiptoed around managing him, hopeful to lower his temperature but careful not to chide the intensity out of him. The Warriors needed to rebuke his rage. Instead, their softer methods merely placated Green and failed to address most of what seethed inside him. For competitive reasons, the Warriors thought they were being rational. Penalize him too harshly, and they penalize themselves, both during his absence and afterward if he returned a more docile athlete. As a 6-foot-6 post player in a sport being overtaken by taller, skinnier and more skilled big men, Green thrives with his mind and physicality. He is a long-armed power forward who often runs the Warriors’ complex read-and-react offense and defends just about every position. He is a winner who doesn’t need to score to make an impact, an invaluable and unselfish four-time all-star. Green, who was a second-round pick, still competes with an underdog’s indignation, which transforms the Warriors from a Stephen Curry-led offensive spectacle to a steely, ornery group of cutthroats. The Warriors were once so talented, deep and full of veterans that they could absorb some of Green’s misconduct. Over the years, time has diminished them. In 2019, their most dominant phase ended when Kevin Durant left after three seasons. Salary cap restrictions and the luxury tax made it difficult to acquire high-quality role players. Stabilizing influences such as Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston retired. Equipped with three lottery picks across the 2020 and 2021 drafts, the Warriors were unable to find a star. The highest of those picks, 2020 No. 2 overall selection James Wiseman, played just 60 games for Golden State before the organization traded him. The inability to meet a championship standard in replenishing the roster has left the Warriors overly dependent on Curry, Green and Klay Thompson, who are deep into their 30s. Curry remains a superstar, but Thompson has been an inconsistent Splash Brother who also struggles defensively. And Green can’t stay on the court because he would rather deliver cheap shots than grab rebounds. When Green sucker-punched Poole in October 2022, the Warriors needed to hammer him. It seemed like a critical moment for him and for a franchise attempting the tricky task of chasing championships and developing the young core of Poole, Wiseman, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody. But the team reinstated Green in time for him to avoid missing any regular season action. The Warriors tolerated his wayward sin and hoped to smooth things over because they were desperate for toughness. Their failings in maintaining the roster have created an exaggerated need for Green and center Kevon Looney to anchor them in the post. They’re now paying a greater price for acting desperate than they may have if they had forced Green to deal with his problems 14 months ago. Maybe the NBA’s decision will make Green change. Maybe it won’t. Since Green punched Poole, the Warriors have gone 54-52 in the regular season. Poole   during the offseason, and that young core is down to Kuminga and Moody, both of whom seem like candidates to be attached to a big trade soon if the Warriors can’t turn around their season. Green’s future is in the hands of the NBA now, and the stakes are higher than ever. Golden State needs him to rebound. If he can’t, it will be hard to move on from an undersized power forward who turns 34 in March, has three seasons remaining on a $100 million contract and plays under heavy scrutiny from the league office. “The tone has obviously changed from any other suspension,” Curry told reporters. “Times have passed where we’re just here because we’re playing basketball. … You’ve got to take a step back and make sure everybody is right.” Green is not all right. He has been wrong for too long. The Warriors thought they were handling him well enough to preserve their dynasty. They didn’t realize they were stoking his rage. It was a disastrous miscalculation.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/16/draymond-green-warriors-suspension/,Washington Post,2023-12-16 09:00:00,

Assuming Raiola — who committed to Ohio State last year before switching to Georgia in May — follows through on his pledge to join the Cornhuskers, his arrival could provide a massive jolt to a program that has fallen on hard times over the past decade. A powerhouse from the 1960s through former coach Tom Osborne’s glory days in the 1990s, Nebraska hasn’t posted a winning record since 2016. This year, its first under Coach Matt Rhule, the Cornhuskers went 5-7 while finishing   in scoring offense out of 130 Football Bowl Subdivision schools. Nebraska was   in scoring defense, however, suggesting that a little help with putting points on the board could go a long way toward improving its fortunes. As a senior this year at a Georgia high school, Raiola threw for 2,666 yards, 34 touchdowns and just one interception in 13 games (via  ). He is the No. 2 recruit in the   rankings for the Class of 2024 and   in ESPN’s rankings. In the video Raiola shared Monday, prominent mention is given to his father’s career at Nebraska. Playing there from 1998 to 2000 before a long career with the Detroit Lions, Dominic Raiola won the first Rimington Trophy as the best center in college football. In addition, the 18-year-old quarterback’s uncle,  , is Nebraska’s offensive line coach. “With all the noise, I tried to find what was right for me and my family … to build off the foundation laid before me,” Dylan Raiola said in the video, which shows him donning a Cornhuskers uniform and heading toward the field at Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium. “But the past is the past, and we look to build a new future.” The video also showed clips of Raiola’s high school highlights and of Rhule giving a fiery locker room speech, interspersed with the quarterback saying: “The leadership here, the fan base here, the culture here — the future is here. I’m here to stay.” “I firmly believe that Nebraska is in my blood,” Raiola said Monday to  . “It’s a great opportunity to be part of something bigger than myself. Nebraska is a special place.” Raiola’s change of heart came on the same day that Georgia’s starting quarterback, Carson Beck,   he was returning for his senior season. In his first year after taking over from Stetson Bennett, Beck was unable to lead Georgia to a third straight national championship but helped the team to a 12-1 record and a No. 6 national ranking. Along the way, Beck completed 72.4 percent of his passes for 3,738 yards, 22 touchdowns and six interceptions. He added 127 yards and four scores on the ground.

"A   issued Monday by FIFA and FIFPRO, the global union for soccer players, found that 1 in 5 players at this year’s World Cup were subjected to online abuse, with the U.S. national team the most targeted squad at the tournament. Two players, understood to be the United States’ Megan Rapinoe and Argentina’s Yamila Rodríguez, were targeted more than any others. A   issued Monday by FIFA and FIFPRO, the global union for soccer players, found that 1 in 5 players at this year’s World Cup were subjected to online abuse, with the U.S. national team the most targeted squad at the tournament. Two players, understood to be the United States’ Megan Rapinoe and Argentina’s Yamila Rodríguez, were targeted more than any others. More than 20 percent of the abuse was homophobic and more than 15 percent was sexual in nature, the report found. The female players were 28.5 percent more likely to be subjected to abuse than male players at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. “The hatred and abuse that exists online is a social crisis that touches individuals all over the world and cannot be simply ignored or easily shrugged off,” the report reads. “In professional football, this toxic online environment is a difficult and risky place to be in for players. … “The risks and mental health challenges associated with being victim of online abuse are real and have a direct and immediate effect on players. Hatred and discrimination in the online environment can be damaging at both a personal and professional level, negatively impacting the players’ ability to be and perform at their best.” The report was created by the Social Media Protection Service (SMPS), which was   in 2022 as a joint effort by FIFA and FIFPRO. World Cup players who opt in to the service have their social media accounts on X/Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube monitored, and abusive comments on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube are hidden by the service. According to the report, SMPS monitored more than 2,000 accounts and flagged and hid 116,000 abusive posts out of 1.3 million total comments (X/Twitter and TikTok do not allow this feature). Rapinoe is outspoken about social issues and has knelt during the national anthem before matches. Rodríguez has a tattoo of Cristiano Ronaldo on her leg, which made some in Argentina think she preferred the Portuguese star to countryman Lionel Messi. In July, Rodríguez responded to her critics on Instagram. “Please stop, I’m not having a good time. At what point did I say that I’m anti-Messi?”  . “I’m not having a bad time because of you (fans) but for the atrocities that are said, without mercy. Can’t you have an idol or a player you like? Messi is our great captain in the national team but the fact that I say that my inspiration and my idol is CR7 does not mean that I hate Messi. What is the problem? We are not all obliged to only love the players of our country.” The report also found that politicians’ messages of support or commiseration cause spikes of abuse, particularly in the United States. The report recommends “briefing campaign / US authorities and political operatives of the knock-on effects from senior politicians sending support,” particularly with the United States set to co-host the next World Cup in 2026.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/11/fifa-world-cup-online-abuse/,Washington Post,2023-12-11 13:58:00,
"The 11-member Montgomery County Council on Tuesday expressed unanimous support for a zoning change that would allow developers to forgo parking spaces when building new housing near public transportation. Council members on Tuesday said the move is intended to encourage residents to go car-free and reduce the cost of new housing to tackle two of the county’s most pressing concerns: the climate crisis and the affordable housing shortage. The 11-member Montgomery County Council on Tuesday expressed unanimous support for a zoning change that would allow developers to forgo parking spaces when building new housing near public transportation. Council members on Tuesday said the move is intended to encourage residents to go car-free and reduce the cost of new housing to tackle two of the county’s most pressing concerns: the climate crisis and the affordable housing shortage. The council’s president, Evan Glass (D-At-Large), and council members Andrew Friedson (D-District 1) and Kristin Mink (D-District 5) sponsored the proposal, known as Zoning Text Amendment 23-10, which would eliminate parking requirements for new residential housing projects located near public transportation hubs. After introducing the amendment Tuesday morning, the remaining eight council members signed on as co-sponsors, indicating that the measure will probably pass early next year. A public hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Jan. 16. “We know that housing is extremely expensive in our region,” Glass said at a Tuesday news conference. “One of the reasons it’s expensive is because, when new buildings are built, they are required to build parking spaces whether they need them or not.” The amendment would allow developers to build new housing without providing parking spaces if the project is located within a half-mile of a Metro station or a Purple Line station, or within a quarter-mile of a bus rapid transit stop or a bus stop that has already been funded to be built in the near future. Existing parking spaces would not be impacted by the measure, Mink said. According to the measure’s sponsors, residential parking infrastructure costs developers between $70,000 and $100,000 per space. Glass, Friedson and Mink said the change would encourage developers to build more affordable housing by reducing the cost of new construction, which they expect would ultimately lower housing costs for renters. The amendment’s sponsors also extolled anticipated benefits to the county’s climate goals. By drawing in more residents who do not need or want to own a car, the council members said they hope to reduce the number of vehicles on county roads and thereby reduce carbon emissions. “This is a way we can achieve our climate and housing goals without hurting people,” Friedson said at Tuesday’s news conference. The council members said residents in downtown areas along public transit corridors already have an excess of unused parking in garages and on the street. Instead of requiring developers to build even more parking spaces that may go unused, the council members said the county needs to evaluate how to more efficiently use the spaces that already exist. The county also plans to review how residential parking permits are granted, the amendment’s sponsors added. “We have a parking management problem we need to address,” Mink said. “The answer is not to build a bunch of new parking that is going to drive up the cost [of housing].” The amendment sponsors were joined Tuesday by residents who already live in parking-free buildings like the Bonifant in downtown Silver Spring, and affordable housing advocates and developers, among others. They echoed the council members’ support for the change, which would align with goals to build more affordable housing units. “Parking can be a shockingly large expense, and that expense gets passed on to residents in higher rents,” said Carrie Kisicki, the Montgomery advocacy manager for the Coalition for Smarter Growth, an advocacy group that pushes for affordable housing, better public transit and safe streets in the greater Washington region. Those advocates said progress on the county’s environmental and housing goals have been hampered by old laws put on the books in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Those regulations, including the residential parking requirements, have not evolved to account for modern policy priorities, they said. “We are in a housing crisis,” said Dan Reed, regional policy director at Greater Greater Washington, “we are in a climate crisis, and we are bound by laws from decades ago that no longer reflect how people in Montgomery County live or how they get around.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/28/montgomery-county-parking-requirements/,Washington Post,2023-11-28 16:19:00,
"The holidays have ushered in a rash of ‘swatting’ incidents targeting politicians across the country, with phony calls for help leading heavily armed law enforcement personnel to show up at the homes of unsuspecting members of Congress and other elected officials. The most   came on Christmas Day, when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.)   on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, “I was just swatted. This is like the 8th time. On Christmas with my family here.” The holidays have ushered in a rash of ‘swatting’ incidents targeting politicians across the country, with phony calls for help leading heavily armed law enforcement personnel to show up at the homes of unsuspecting members of Congress and other elected officials. The most   came on Christmas Day, when Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.)   on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, “I was just swatted. This is like the 8th time. On Christmas with my family here.” Other similar episodes have followed this week in locations as varied as  ,  .,  , and  . On Thursday, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) posted on social media that his home in Naples, Fla., had been swatted by “cowards” while he was at dinner with his wife. “These criminals wasted the time & resources of our law enforcement in a sick attempt to terrorize my family,” Scott wrote. Most recent incidents have targeted Republicans, but Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, was among those who had law enforcement investigate a matter near her home after a report of a shooting that police determined was a hoax. These episodes are the latest in a dangerous trend of people trying to send law enforcement personnel to homes, businesses or schools by falsely claiming a violent crime is underway or just took place. Lauren R. Shapiro, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said lawmakers may be targeted over specific legislation, or because of their more broadly held beliefs and positions. When “someone disagrees with a person’s beliefs/statements/etc., the person may lash out by launching a harassment campaign, stalking, swatting, etc., to try to intimidate the target into silence,” Shapiro said in an email. Another expert said high-profile episodes targeting lawmakers could spur copycats. “People learn of those threats, and it spreads,” said Gregory H. Winger, an assistant professor focusing on cybersecurity at the University of Cincinnati’s School of International and Public Affairs. In Greene’s case, a man in New York called a Georgia suicide hotline and falsely claimed that he had shot his girlfriend at Greene’s address. On Thursday, Greene   on social media that the homes where her two daughters live were also swatted. “Whoever is doing this, you are going to get caught and it won’t be funny to you anymore,” she wrote. Following the episode on Christmas Day, several other lawmakers in Georgia and around the country were similarly targeted. About an hour after Greene’s social media post, former Nebraska state senator Adam Morfeld   on X, “Merry Christmas to all, except for the jerk who called 911 pretending to be me claiming I was going to kill myself.” Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.) also announced that day on social media that “our home was swatted this afternoon.” The day after Christmas, “numerous” sheriff’s deputies responded to the home of Ohio state Rep. Kevin D. Miller (R) “on a false report of a shooting,” he   on X. The event “put several lives at risk and was a huge waste of resources.” Several state senators in Georgia — as well as the state’s lieutenant governor — have also been targeted this week, prompting calls for state legislation to strengthen laws against swatting. Among those targeted was state Sen. Clint Dixon (R). He was watching football with his wife on Christmas night at his Buford home when police arrived in response to a caller who said he had killed his wife and was holding someone else hostage,   the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. When a member of Congress is targeted by a swatting call, the U.S. Capitol Police seeks to “work closely with our local and federal law enforcement partners,” the agency said in a statement. “To protect ongoing investigations and to minimize the risk of copy-cats, we cannot provide more details at this time.” Swatting has been employed as an intimidation tactic for more than 15 years. In early 2008, the FBI’s website warned of the   calling it a “much more serious twist” on the old crime of hacking into phone companies to make long-distance calls. Since then, the problem has grown in frequency and severity. In 2017, police in Wichita   a 28-year-old man who opened the front door of the home they had been summoned to by a phony call about a hostage situation. In 2020, a 60-year-old man in Tennessee   after armed police surrounded his home while responding to a false report that someone had been shot at that address. In April, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)   to investigate dozens of swatting episodes aimed at schools. In October, The Washington Post   that over the past year, more than 500 schools in the United States had been subjected to a coordinated swatting effort, based on a review of media reports and dozens of public records requests. One widely cited figure comes from Kevin Kolbye, a former FBI swatting expert, who   that he estimated the number of swatting episodes went from about 400 in 2011 to more than 1,000 in 2019. In the past two decades, there have probably been 20,000 swatting episodes, according Shapiro, the professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of the book “Cyberpredators and Their Prey.” It “has been a problem for a while.” The problem has grown as law enforcement personnel have been responding to an   and  , according to Winger, who said swatters found a way to “weaponize police responses.” The increased public safety challenges posed by active shooters and other assailants, plus fake calls for emergency responses, “are two sides of the same coin,” Winger said. “How do you know whether that is a real situation or somebody being swatted, because the phone call you get is often quite similar.” Shapiro said legislation to combat swatting and train personnel how to monitor and identify it has been hindered in Congress for years. One reason for the delay is that lawmakers who support such legislation can become victims of it, Shapiro said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/28/marjorie-taylor-greene-others-swatted-christmas/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 15:34:00,
"While Major League Baseball’s owners stole the headlines this week when  , the cogs behind another potentially transformative development for the sport churned away in a Houston courtroom. Judge Christopher Lopez of the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Texas approved a deal between Diamond Sports and the NBA teams whose games it is under contract to broadcast on its Bally Sports networks. The deal indicates that the broadcasts would continue until the end of the 2024 season and then terminate. While Major League Baseball’s owners stole the headlines this week when  , the cogs behind another potentially transformative development for the sport churned away in a Houston courtroom. Judge Christopher Lopez of the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of Texas approved a deal between Diamond Sports and the NBA teams whose games it is under contract to broadcast on its Bally Sports networks. The deal indicates that the broadcasts would continue until the end of the 2024 season and then terminate. In the process of petitioning the judge to approve that pact, a lawyer for bankrupt Diamond Sports suggested the company hopes to come to a similar agreement with the 12 MLB teams whose games it is still contractually obligated to broadcast. But lawyers for both Diamond Sports’s parent company, Sinclair, and MLB raised concerns with the NBA deal, centered around its effect on the company’s ability to pay for its baseball obligations, even through next season. Lopez, the judge, said he planned to schedule a hearing to assess those objections, and lawyers for MLB indicated Wednesday that they would be discussing proposals that would solidify Diamond Sports’s plans for its remaining MLB markets next year. As with the NBA, and an expected deal with the NHL, any agreement reached would likely be geared toward ending Diamond Sports’s broadcasting obligations after 2024. “This is a very, very complicated situation,” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday. “Our primary goal at this point is certainty.” MLB has not had certainty when it comes to Diamond Sports’s plans since the Sinclair subsidiary  , though some people familiar with the process would argue that the league did not have the certainty it should have about Diamond Sports’s solvency when it took on debt to  . When Diamond missed its contractually obligated payment to the San Diego Padres last year, MLB was prepared to take over broadcasts and did so, marketing a streaming package to viewers in that market. MLB also had to take over broadcasts of Arizona Diamondbacks games in July when Diamond Sports rejected its rights agreement. Despite mere hours of notice before the San Diego takeover, MLB seemingly handled the production of both teams’ games without an issue. But Manfred said he is unwilling to go through another season of reacting rather than preparing. “It kind of came off without a hitch in the sense that San Diego was terminated, Arizona was rejected, we were able to step in and broadcast those games, fans were not disadvantaged in any way. In fact, our reach was better because we had a digital product available,” Manfred said. “To undertake another summer where we have 12 teams at risk given that the financial situation of the Diamond RSNs has further deteriorated is not an appealing prospect. It’s one thing to pick up one or two. Picking up 12 with no notice is a herculean feat. We need to know so our fans are not disrupted.” The certainty Manfred wants is both logistical and financial. For much of the last three decades, behemoth cable rights contracts sparked exponential growth in player salaries and team revenue, providing steady, predictable streams of revenue that were sturdier than ticket sales or merchandise. Even as his office was prepared to take over production and marketing of their broadcasts, Manfred was clear that the end of the Padres and Diamondbacks agreements with Diamond Sports would cost both franchises money, and that the league could not backstop the full difference between what they would have made under the original deal and what they would make from new agreements beyond 2023. The remaining 12 teams to which Diamond Sports has rights enter this winter in similar situations, unable to predict how long their broadcast partner will be able to make its payments to them. A lawyer for Diamond Sports said Wednesday that the company’s intention “is to broadcast almost all of [our] Major League Baseball teams next year,” but added that “there are a few, a very few, for which we do not have agreements in place.” “And that, frankly, at this point, are too expensive for us to broadcast without concessions,” he added. “I am told that those discussions are taking place, there have been reach-outs to both of the teams involved.” The World Series Champion Texas Rangers and Cleveland Guardians, two Diamond Sports teams, have been open about the glaring financial uncertainty created by the fragile state of their rights agreements. “There’s no deal with MLB, there’s no deal with the Rangers,” a lawyer for the Rangers said in court Wednesday as he raised concerns about how the NBA deal might affect Diamond’s ability to pay for its agreement with the team. “We don’t know what [Diamond’s] intention is with respect to the Rangers.” Earlier this week, Guardians President of Baseball Operations, Chris Antonetti, indicated   that the team would not be able to offer a contract to effective homegrown starter Cal Quantrill because the more than $6 million he was projected to make in arbitration seemed unlikely to fit in a crunched payroll. On Friday, the Guardians traded Quantrill to the Colorado Rockies for a minor league catcher. “We don’t yet have clarity on that other than there’s financial uncertainty, so that makes things a bit harder to plan,” Antonetti  . “It’s difficult to plan in a normal year at this point in the offseason as we’re still trying to wrap our arms around what our revenue might be. The Bally’s component adds more uncertainty and that certainly makes it harder.” The other teams still under contract with Diamond — the Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Cincinnati Reds, Minnesota Twins and Tampa Bay Rays — are in a similar boat. Even if Diamond and MLB work out a deal to broadcast their games through the 2024 season, it is unclear what kind of value the league will get for their broadcast rights on a fresh open market that reflects a dip in cable subscriptions because of streaming. Still, there is a silver lining to the process to which Manfred has long been willing to point publicly, even as he acknowledges his teams will likely lose revenue to Diamond’s bankruptcy. Most of the league’s current cable rights deals, including the one with Diamond, preclude MLB from selling streaming packages to fans in local markets, resulting in blackouts for local fans who do not have access to the right cable providers. In the D.C. area, for example, fans without a cable subscription that gives them access to the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network cannot watch Nationals games even if they purchase the   package because the preexisting deals with cable providers include regional exclusivity. But if those deals are terminated or not renewed, the league can produce its own broadcasts, then market them to as many cable companies as it wants. Perhaps more importantly, MLB might be able to market the streaming rights on its own, selling local subscription packages like it did last year for the Padres and Diamondbacks. If Diamond’s contracts all dissolve by the end of next year, MLB could suddenly find itself with streaming rights for 14 of its 30 teams, perhaps tapping into another form of broadcast revenue. Manfred has acknowledged a larger streaming presence would not necessarily make up all the cable money immediately, but that it would make access to baseball’s product much easier and more direct. Under the current system, the league funnels the money made from those local streaming subscribers back to the Padres and Diamondbacks, respectively.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/18/diamond-sports-mlb-broadcasts-whats-next/,Washington Post,2023-11-18 08:16:00,
"KYIV — A modest U.S. weapons package for Ukraine — what is likely be the last one until Congress approves new funding — was met with tepid gratitude in Kyiv on Thursday. The $250 million package, which includes artillery shells, air defense equipment, antiaircraft and antitank missiles, and small arms ammunition for the fight against Russia, will address some battlefield shortfalls, but it still leaves Ukraine facing an uncertain future and without critical financial support entering the new year. KYIV — A modest U.S. weapons package for Ukraine — what is likely be the last one until Congress approves new funding — was met with tepid gratitude in Kyiv on Thursday. The $250 million package, which includes artillery shells, air defense equipment, antiaircraft and antitank missiles, and small arms ammunition for the fight against Russia, will address some battlefield shortfalls, but it still leaves Ukraine facing an uncertain future and without critical financial support entering the new year. President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked   in a post on X, formerly Twitter, for the weapons that “will cover Ukraine’s most pressing needs.” “U.S. leadership in the coalition of over 50 countries providing Ukraine with military aid is critical to countering terror and aggression not only in Ukraine but around the world,” he added. Yehor Cherniev, a lawmaker in Ukraine’s parliament, said the package “is only intended to keep us going for a little while longer, but it is not able to change the situation on the battlefield in our favor or even enable us to resist effectively.” And it’s unclear if or when Ukraine will receive more aid from its biggest backer. “If a full package of aid to Ukraine is not voted through in the near future,” Cherniev said, “it will be difficult to restrain [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.” Ukrainian officials have warned that without an influx of new funds, some salaries and social payments could be affected starting in January. Financial assistance from Washington alone accounts for roughly a third of Ukraine’s budget. That money can’t be used to directly pay soldiers their salary, but with so much money already going to the military, the Western aid is critical for civilian enterprises to continue running. In addition to the uncertainty around U.S. aid, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is  . Adding to the budget constraints, Zelensky said last week that Ukraine’s military leadership submitted a plan to mobilize up to 500,000 more troops for the fight against Russia — what Zelensky estimated would cost the country some $13 billion. “I would like to know where the money will come from,” Zelensky said during a news conference in Kyiv. Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko   that Ukraine has “exhausted our internal potential to finance military needs.” “We do not rule out that we will have to look for additional internal funding sources,” Marchenko added. While Ukraine waits for the passage of additional aid by Congress, this latest package will be welcome news to soldiers at the front line, who have complained that already scarce ammunition supplies have declined in recent months. Some are firing up to five times less artillery. After Ukraine’s counteroffensive stalled with the start of winter, Russia has seized the battlefield initiative, claiming some gains near Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine. White House officials have suggested in recent weeks that this weapons package, known as a “drawdown” from Pentagon inventories, was the last one they could make with existing funds, seeking to leverage what they have described as a dire funding situation to push Congress to approve Biden’s request for an additional $60 billion related to the war in Ukraine. Since Putin’s February 2022 invasion, the United States has committed $44 billion in security aid. “This small package of aid is evidence for us that there are problems with the support of Ukraine from the U.S.,” Cherniev said. “We still believe that these problems are temporary and will be resolved very soon. … In the coming year, the Russians are most definitely counting on the fact that U.S. support for Ukraine will decrease and they will be able to achieve their goal.” With future funds uncertain, Ukrainian officials have placed more emphasis on domestic arms production. Zelensky has vowed that Ukraine will produce 1 million drones next year, and Kyiv has started producing artillery ammunition, though in small quantities. Cherniev warned that continued U.S. support “is the only factor on which it depends how long the war will last and how it will end.” Despite the relative smaller size of the latest package, Mykola Davydiuk, a Kyiv-based political expert, said, “I think that this is good news.” “The fact that our partners don’t leave us to fend for ourselves, even when bureaucratic moments don’t allow them to transfer the sum of money that they want to and that we would want to, they still don’t abandon us and support us either way,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/28/ukraine-us-funding-reaction/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 09:20:00,

"Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Wizards, Capitals and Mystics, has asked D.C. for $600 million of public funding for a major renovation of Capital One Arena, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The funding would make up the bulk of an $800 million renovation plan Monumental has outlined to the city, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The remaining $200 million would be covered by Monumental, which is owned by founder and chief executive Ted Leonsis. Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Wizards, Capitals and Mystics, has asked D.C. for $600 million of public funding for a major renovation of Capital One Arena, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The funding would make up the bulk of an $800 million renovation plan Monumental has outlined to the city, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The remaining $200 million would be covered by Monumental, which is owned by founder and chief executive Ted Leonsis. One of the people outlined the ask: Monumental would receive the $600 million over four years and use it mostly on construction. The major priorities are to transform the seating bowl — fewer nosebleed seats, more seats close to the court and ice — as well as add a food court that would be open during nongame hours and a new, glassy entrance at Seventh and F streets. Monumental wants to do incremental construction over four consecutive summers, starting in 2024, to avoid disrupting the playing seasons of the Capitals or Wizards, this person said. A spokesperson for D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) issued a lengthy statement that she said was jointly attributable to Monumental. “The District and Monumental Sports are proud to have had a longstanding and positive relationship that has contributed greatly the vibrancy of this city,” the spokesperson wrote. “ … The District recognizes that Capital One Arena serves as an important economic anchor as we continue to reimagine and reinvigorate our Downtown.” Monumental’s request comes after the Nationals, in September, sent local leaders a letter asking the city to repurpose parts of the existing “Ballpark Revenue Fund,” which is dedicated to paying off the municipal bonds floated to fund the construction of Nationals Park, into a “Ballpark Modernization & Sustainability Fund.” The proposal would put taxes on tickets, food and merchandise, taxes on parking and the lease payment into a new fund to maintain and modernize the city-owned ballpark, but it wouldn’t create a new tax or pull from other budgets. Bowser (D) must juggle requests from the wealthy sports owners with a host of other issues, including  , a   and the looming competition with Maryland and Virginia over the next Commanders stadium. Bowser, a vocal champion for the Commanders to return to the site of RFK Stadium, recently   as she waits for a bill that would give the city control of the federal RFK site to advance through Congress. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) has already said he’d support giving the football team public funds for the construction of a stadium in his state. Last month, Bowser’s administration selected two contractors for a $394,000 “sports study” to consider ways to fund a Commanders stadium, as well as address the financial requests of the other sports franchises, which are owned by Leonsis, the Lerners and private equity billionaire Josh Harris (Commanders). The owners’ asks of the city come as franchise values across pro sports continue to skyrocket. Pro teams routinely sell for multiples of the revenue they generate, in part due to ownership real estate holdings and TV contracts. According to Sportico, a sports business website, the Wizards are   at $2.7 billion, and the Capitals are   at $1.22 billion. The city is not obligated to pay for upgrades at Capital One Arena, which was built in 1997 and is one of the older facilities in the NHL and NBA. But D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) has said he supports giving Monumental public funds because the arena is an economic anchor in a fragile downtown. In a recent interview, Mendelson said he did not have firsthand knowledge of Monumental’s request for $600 million and did not know any details about how it would be structured or over how many years, making it difficult to say what he would or wouldn’t support. “The impact is different depending on the structure,” he said. In  in The Washington Post over the summer, Council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6) argued Monumental deserves public funds more than the Commanders because the multipurpose arena downtown hosts more events and brings in more money than a football stadium would. Meanwhile, Monumental remains in negotiations with Virginia officials about relocating to a site in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood, according to a person familiar with that effort, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share confidential information. One potential site could be near the   in the area and a   serviced by the Blue and Yellow lines. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) and members of his office have taken the lead in those negotiations, with the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) playing a supportive role, that person said. There is a sense among at least some members of the commonwealth’s team that Monumental would prefer to remain in D.C. and is using the prospect of a move to Virginia as a bargaining chip with the District, that person said. Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter declined to comment, referring questions to VEDP, which did not respond to requests for comment. Alexandria Mayor Justin M. Wilson (D) declined to comment but said that the city is “bullish” about economic development in the Potomac Yard area. A spokeswoman for the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership declined to comment. Even if Virginia offered Monumental a lot of money to lure it away from D.C., the company’s continued investment around Capital One would seemingly make it more difficult to actually leave. Over the years, Virginia has been willing to offer large financial packages for sports facilities but lost out to D.C. on venues like Nationals Park, Entertainment and Sports Arena in Congress Heights and DC United’s Audi Field. Over the summer, Leonsis strengthened his empire by striking a prospective deal with Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund and rebranding NBC Sports Washington, the regional sports network he acquired last year, as Monumental Sports Network. But, according to a person with knowledge of the company’s internal workings, the business staff has “outgrown” the arena and significantly expanded into neighboring Gallery Place, the mixed-use development attached to the arena. Gallery Place is for sale because an affiliate of Oxford Properties, the real estate company that owns it, defaulted on a loan secured against the development,  . Meanwhile, Monumental has snapped up vacancies for office space, employee parking and an esports center, which opened in March. The company is also building a new MSN studio that’s scheduled to open early next year. Leonsis, who acquired full control of the arena from the late Abe Pollin in 2010, has for years complained about having to pay a mortgage with unfavorable terms. In 2016,   he was paying $14 million per year in interest, $9 million in principal and maintenance costs that the year before totaled $13 million. By comparison, he said, most teams pay rent of $3 million to $4 million to play in municipally owned arenas. At the time, Leonsis said he had “the worst building deal in professional sports” and suggested that he could leave the city when he paid off the mortgage. It’s unclear how much Leonsis is now paying annually on the mortgage, as well as how much remains on the principal. There’s a ground lease on the arena, which means Monumental owns the building and the city owns the land below it. In 2007, the city invested $50 million of public funding into capital improvements to the arena, and in exchange, Pollin exercised two 10-year options to extend the lease from its original end date, 2027, to 2047. But Monumental could get out of the lease earlier. If it pays off the bond on the lease — and it’s allowed to pay the remaining $35 million in principal in a lump sum at any time — then the lease extension would be nullified, reverting the end date back to 2027. In 2019, Monumental finished a $70 million, privately funded renovation project at the arena. The company installed a new scoreboard and upgraded suites and seats. But, according to a team official, the building still needs additional structural improvements, such as to the HVAC systems and upgrades to the ceiling that would allow Capital One to host bigger concerts and events. Around the same time, Leonsis started to grow frustrated with the area around the arena. He was particularly bothered by buskers, who played loud music outside his office. In the last few years, the pandemic and remote work have hurt downtowns across the country, and Leonsis has complained about the neighborhood and the city’s lack of investment in the building. In May, Mendelson said he met with Bowser to discuss Monumental. Mendelson said Bowser was “quite clear” she wanted to work with Leonsis even though, according to two people, the relationship between Leonsis and Bowser is strained. In June, Mendelson met with Leonsis and Monica Dixon, Monumental’s president of external affairs and chief administrative officer. The meeting focused on “how they could stay at the arena and deal with the deferred maintenance,” Mendelson said. In the arena’s neighborhood, residents and business owners have voiced concerns about criminal activity on the busy sidewalks near Gallery Place, including suspected drug-dealing that they believe can lead to violence. In the past, D.C. has provided 27 police officers to patrol the perimeter of Capital One during games. But in recent years, D.C. police has struggled with staffing, and the number of officers has fallen to three, according to one Monumental official. The company has made up the difference by paying off-duty officers.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/03/monumental-capital-one-arena-improvements-dc/,Washington Post,2023-11-03 19:31:00,

So much so that the Kansas City Chiefs tight end made it clear Wednesday he would be much happier if the division rival Los Angeles Chargers hired someone else to be their next coach. “I don’t want to see it,” Kelce said on his “ ” podcast. “I hope they get some trash-[expletive] coach who nobody knows.” For it to even be a possibility, Belichick would first have to part ways with the New England Patriots, whom he has coached for the past 24 years. This season, though, has seen the formerly dynastic club bottom out with a 3-11 record after also posting losing seasons in two of the previous three years. The   has led a number of observers to wonder if Belichick is entering the final few games of his Patriots tenure. That, in turn, has led to plenty of speculation   to various current and expected vacancies around the NFL, including  , who   and general manager Tom Telesco last week. Kelce’s older brother and podcast co-host, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, had no reservations about endorsing Belichick for the Chargers and all other coach-needy teams. “People are saying Bill Belichick might be the front-runner for the head coaching role,” Jason said of the Chargers’ situation. “Yeah, no [expletive]. Bill Belichick is going to be the front-runner for   head-coaching role. If he is available, I think everybody is going to want this guy.” At another point in the podcast, Jason said to Travis: “The Chargers have some great pieces. Who do you think they should go after as the next coach?” “Go get like a young, never-heard-of college coach. I don’t want a [expletive] good coach to come into [expletive] my division, dude,” the 11th-year tight end replied. “I hope they [expletive] hire some jabroni, man. I hope they hire two [expletive] jabronis who don’t know what they’re doing and we’re talking about this [again] in three years or two years. Just doing the same thing, rinse and repeat.” Travis got an up-close look at Belichick’s coaching acumen Sunday, when the Chiefs beat the Patriots in Foxborough, Mass. Immediately following the 27-17 win, Kelce made a point of sharing a moment with the 72-year-old, six-time Super Bowl-winning coach. “I just mentioned how much I respect him and how much it’s always the biggest challenge I go up against in the National Football League, going up against one of his defenses,” Kelce said Wednesday of the encounter. “I just wanted to make sure he heard that from my mouth because it’s been a pleasure going up against him all these years.” Belichick and Kelce show respect postgame 🤝    Although Kelce has won five of his six regular season games against the Patriots since Coach Andy Reid joined the Chiefs, Belichick has gotten the win in two playoff meetings, including a heartbreaking defeat for Kansas City in the AFC championship game in January 2019. That was when New England still had Tom Brady, and Belichick’s 28-36 record following the legendary quarterback’s departure has led some to question whether the coach deserves to be quite so revered. To Jason Kelce, however, Belichick still has a remarkable ability to get “the best out of everybody that plays for him.” “He’s such a phenomenal coach, it’s weird hearing things that are being said,” the 36-year-old center, who has been named first-team all-pro five times, said on the podcast. “It’s hard to imagine a guy of that stature not being coveted by anybody in the NFL.” There already have been reports out of Boston, though, that Patriots owner Robert Kraft has decided to   from Belichick. Travis Kelce said on the podcast that when asked Sunday if he thought that was the last time he would play against the coach, he replied, “It might not be here [in New England] — whatever the situation is going on here, it might not be it — but I think that guy’s got some football left in him.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/20/travis-kelce-bill-belichick/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 22:29:00,

The Cowboys enjoyed a 9 (well, 8.6) to 5 advantage in yards per play, which offset Washington’s 14-minute advantage in time of possession. Dallas averaged 10.5 yards play on its four first-half drives, three of which resulted in touchdowns. Six different Cowboys finished with plays of 20-plus yards. For the second consecutive Thanksgiving, the NFL paid tribute to legendary broadcaster John Madden, who  . The coin used for the pregame coin toss before all three Thanksgiving games featured a silhouette of the Super Bowl-winning coach on one side and a   on the reverse side. The Commanders-Cowboys broadcast highlighted a classic  of Madden, who worked for all four major networks over three decades as an analyst, using his telestrator to discuss “mother” and “father” Gatorade buckets during Super Bowl XXI. If only he were still around to narrate Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott picking at a turkey leg on sideline with 6 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. In a planned touchdown celebration, Prescott and a few teammates pulled   out of the Salvation Army’s Red Kettle beyond the end zone after KaVontae Turpin’s 34-yard scoring grab gave Dallas a 35-10 lead. Dak enjoying his turkey leg early 😂 (via  ) The Commanders’ offense wasn’t half bad. Washington rushed for 108 yards on 27 carries, quarterback Sam Howell completed 28 of 44 passes for 300 yards and Washington possessed the ball for nearly 37 minutes. After becoming the first team in four years to commit six turnovers in a game last Sunday, Washington had only one turnover against Dallas. Before Thursday, according to @OptaSTATS, NFL teams were a combined 57-0 over the last 25 regular seasons when eclipsing 100 yards rushing, 250 yards passing and 35 minutes of possession while also committing no more than one turnover and being penalized for no more than 25 yards. According to , the last four teams to hit all those benchmarks won by an average of 26 points. The Commanders managed to lose by 35 in falling to 2-9 all-time against Dallas on Thanksgiving. Entering today, NFL teams were a combined 57-0 over the last 25 regular seasons when having a game with: 100+ rushing yards 250+ passing yards 35:00+ TOP no more than 25 penalty yards no more than 1 turnover The Commanders did all that today and lost by 35. After catching three passes for 11 yards over his last two games, Samuel made a season-high nine grabs for 100 yards to lead all receivers. It was Samuel’s first 100-yard receiving day since his final game with the Carolina Panthers in Week 17 of the 2020 season. His 30-yard catch on the final play of the first quarter set up Joey Slye’s field goal that got Washington on the board, and his 13-yard catch on the Commanders’ next possession set up Howell’s one-yard touchdown run. Dallas limited Terry McLaurin to four catches for 50 yards. Washington advanced into Cowboys territory on its first two possessions, only to punt the ball away both times. After Coach Ron Rivera’s head-scratching decision to punt on fourth and two from the Dallas 42 on Washington’s second drive, the Cowboys marched 90 yards on 11 plays for a touchdown that set the tone for the remainder of the game. The Commanders went for it on fourth down on three of their first four possessions in the second half and failed each time. On the first attempt, running back Brian Robinson Jr. collided with motioning wide receiver Jahan Dotson in the backfield before being dropped for a loss. Granted, it wasn’t the kind of history Washington wanted to be a part of, but with less than 5 minutes remaining and Dallas leading 38-10, Howell threw a pass toward the sideline that was intercepted by Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland. “There it is, this is history if Bland can take it the distance!” Nantz shouted as the second-year pro from Fresno State raced toward the end zone, dodging would-be tacklers in his path. Bland’s score, expertly described by Nantz, was his fifth interception return for a touchdown this season, breaking a tie with Philadelphia’s Eric Allen (1993), Kansas City’s Jim Kearney (1972) and Houston’s Ken Houston (1971) for the most in a single season. Allen had an interception return for a touchdown   in 1993. Houston was traded from the Oilers to Washington in 1973. BLAND DID IT AGAIN!!!

"TEMPE, Ariz. — Jack McBain scored with 20 seconds left in overtime and the Arizona Coyotes overcame a four-goal deficit to beat the Colorado Avalanche 5-4 on Wednesday night. McBain scored on a scramble in front of the net to give Arizona its fifth victory in six games, with the only loss at Colorado on Saturday night. TEMPE, Ariz. — Jack McBain scored with 20 seconds left in overtime and the Arizona Coyotes overcame a four-goal deficit to beat the Colorado Avalanche 5-4 on Wednesday night. McBain scored on a scramble in front of the net to give Arizona its fifth victory in six games, with the only loss at Colorado on Saturday night. “I just went to the net hard and got a piece of it on my stick,” McBain said. “It was a greasy one but I’ll take it. Obviously, it was an amazing comeback. With goalie Karel Vejmelka off for an extra attacker, Sean Durzi tied it at 4 with a wrist shot from between the circles with 2:07 remaining in regulation. Durzi also had three assists. “We played a really urgent game,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. “When you play a world-class opponent like that, a Stanley Cup champion. We have a ton of respect for them, but we showed we could compete.” The Coyotes, who trailed 4-1 after two periods, are 12-5 at 4,400-seat Mullett Arena. It was the fifth four-goal comeback in franchise history. “I know guys keep saying it, but the atmosphere is good,” McBain said. “The fans hung with us even when we were down. It’s been fun to play in here.” Lawson Crouse, Michael Kesselring and Jason Zucker also scored for Arizona, and Vejmelka made 20 saves. The Coyotes overcame a three-goal deficit in a 4-3 victory over Ottawa on Dec. 19. “The game against Ottawa was the first really good comeback we had,” Tourigny said. “It gives you the hope. Now you know it can happen. It doesn’t mean it will happen, but if you stay with it and keep working, it can happen. That’s a good feeling.” Nathan MacKinnon had a goal and an assist for Colorado to extend his points streak to 19 games, one short of the franchise record set by Paul Stastny in 2006-07. MacKinnon also has an NHL-high 27 points in December, a career high for a month, and is a point short of Stastny’s team record for points in a month. Mikko Rantanen had a goal and an assist for Colorado, Jonathan Drouin and Logan O’Connor also scored and Alexandar Georgiev made 22 saves. The Avalanche are 0-3-3 in their last six road games. “I love the way we played the first forty minutes,” Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. “Third, we got lost in ‘D’ zone coverage a few times. They have a lot of movement and a lot of guys active in there. It’s not the volume, but when we had a breakdown in ‘D’ zone coverage it was in the back of the net.” MacKinnon gave Colorado a 4-0 lead on a two-man advantage with 6:34 left in the second period. Crouse scored with 3:29 left in the second on a wrist shot from the right circle. Kesselring cut it to two goals at 3:48 of the third, and Zucker made it 4-3 on a wraparound at 7:04. “Obviously, at 4-nothing, it was frustrating because I felt we played well,” Tourigny said. “Then Crouser broke the ice, and from there I won’t say I thought we would win, but I thought it will be a game. It’s not over. When Kess scored, it’s 4-2. The worst lead in hockey is two goals.” “There’s no quit in our group. They compete every day. That’s their DNA. That’s the way they play.” UP NEXT Avalanche: At St. Louis on Friday night.

"Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa opted out of playing in the Music City Bowl on Dec. 30 against Auburn, Coach Michael Locksley announced Tuesday afternoon, leaving the Terrapins without their record-setting four-year starter, who is turning his attention to the NFL draft. Tagovailoa is the Big Ten leader with 11,256 career passing yards, also the most in Maryland history. He holds a slew of other program records, including passing touchdowns (76), touchdowns responsible for (89), completion percentage (67.1) and passing efficiency (145.9). Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa opted out of playing in the Music City Bowl on Dec. 30 against Auburn, Coach Michael Locksley announced Tuesday afternoon, leaving the Terrapins without their record-setting four-year starter, who is turning his attention to the NFL draft. Tagovailoa is the Big Ten leader with 11,256 career passing yards, also the most in Maryland history. He holds a slew of other program records, including passing touchdowns (76), touchdowns responsible for (89), completion percentage (67.1) and passing efficiency (145.9). The two-time second-team all-Big Ten selection’s decision comes a week before the Terrapins (7-5) are scheduled to depart for Nashville for final preparations in their quest to win a bowl game in the third consecutive season for the first time in school history. “I had to remove the attachment, man, because I love hard, and I’ve got a big heart for the guys that I have a chance to coach and recruit,” Locksley said. “They’re not easy conversations. I’m sure it wasn’t easy for him to say, ‘Coach, I’m not going to play in the game,’ and he still has other decisions to make.” Locksley indicated he plans to start redshirt sophomore Billy Edwards Jr., the primary backup to Tagovailoa this season, in Maryland’s first bowl game against an SEC opponent since it beat Tennessee in the 2002 Peach Bowl. Cameron Edge, a redshirt freshman, is also expected to play. Tagovailoa started all 12 games during the regular season, completing 290 of 437 passes (66.4 percent) for 3,377 yards — the most among Big Ten quarterbacks — and 25 touchdowns with 11 interceptions, matching a career high. The fifth-year senior added five rushing scores, his most in a season. Tagovailoa is one of two Football Bowl Subdivision quarterbacks with at least 2,500 passing yards in each of the past three seasons, along with Seth Henigan of Memphis. “Taulia’s my guy,” Terrapins senior linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II said. “Great brother, great teammate, great friend, not only to me but the whole team, and he’s meant a lot to this program, and he’s giving up a lot. He’s doing what’s best for him. He’s transitioning to that next level, and he’s moving on, so we’re pulling for him. We’re excited for him.” Tagovailoa played his final game for the Terrapins on Nov. 25,   in Piscataway, N.J. He completed 24 of 31 passes for 361 yards, his most this year, to become the Big Ten’s all-time passing leader. He also threw for three touchdowns and ran for another to assure Maryland finished with a third straight winning record for the first time since 2001 to 2003. The transfer from Alabama — where Locksley served as an assistant and coached Tagovailoa’s older brother, Tua, the current starter for the Miami Dolphins — had been voted a captain for the Music City Bowl, joining Hyppolite, graduate wide receiver Jeshaun Jones and senior safety Beau Brade. “Definitely surprising, but I’m happy for him, and I’m thankful for him and everything he’s done for me and for this program,” Jones said. “He’s played a huge role for me and my career here and a huge role in our team’s success. We’re all thankful for him and grateful for his time here.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/19/taulia-tagovailoa-music-city-bowl/,Washington Post,2023-12-19 16:23:00,
"NEW YORK — The annoyance radiated off Chelsea Gray on Friday afternoon. She stood on the New York Liberty’s practice court in the belly of Barclays Center, rolled her eyes and shook her head, more than ready to join her Las Vegas Aces teammates. The WNBA’s “Point Gawd” didn’t even want to entertain the thought of the Aces being on the precipice of history. NEW YORK — The annoyance radiated off Chelsea Gray on Friday afternoon. She stood on the New York Liberty’s practice court in the belly of Barclays Center, rolled her eyes and shook her head, more than ready to join her Las Vegas Aces teammates. The WNBA’s “Point Gawd” didn’t even want to entertain the thought of the Aces being on the precipice of history. “After the trophy, I’ll be able to do that,” she said. The business is unfinished for the Aces, but they have a chance to make history Sunday afternoon when they face the Liberty in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals. A victory would give the Aces a three-game sweep and make them the first team to win back-to-back WNBA championships since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002 — and that’s just the start. A win also would make them the seventh team to go undefeated in the postseason and the first to go 8-0 in the playoffs. Only two teams have won consecutive titles in the 27-year history of the league. The Houston Comets won the first four WNBA titles from 1997 to 2000 with Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson, and three-time MVP Lisa Leslie helped the Sparks go back-to-back after that. Even the Minnesota Lynx teams that won four titles and made six Finals appearances between 2011 and 2017 were unable to secure two in a row. Eight-time all-star Seimone Augustus, who won four rings with Minnesota, noted that every year is different and that winning a second straight title is often more difficult. “People’s roles change, mind-sets, personalities,” Augustus said. “Success brings some things out of people, and some ... could be good or bad. The very first year that you win, it’s like they see you, but they don’t see you.  The second year, you’re not a surprise. And so that expectation, the bull’s-eye that’s on your back, every arena that you step into, everybody is just shooting and gunning after you. And that’s a different feel than the feel that you had the year before. Can you endure that?” Most of the Aces’ roster is the same as their 2022 championship team. Las Vegas was labeled a super team after the addition of two-time MVP Candace Parker and sixth player of the year Alysha Clark, but Parker played just 18 games before being having surgery to repair a fracture in her left foot. Still, Gray, who won a championship with the Sparks in 2016, said these Aces don’t remind her of any other team. “Nah, man, this group is so different, even from last year,” Gray said. “Our chemistry is really good, and it’s just improving. I wouldn’t say it reminds me of another team. It’s different from last year. The vibe is different. A lot of personnel is the same, but the vibe is just different.” The organization had single-digit wins in its last three years as the San Antonio Stars before it moved to Las Vegas before the 2018 season. From 2017 to 2019, it drafted Kelsey Plum, A’ja Wilson and Jackie Young No. 1 overall. Then the Aces were fortunate enough to lure Coach Becky Hammon from the NBA last season. The elite WNBA teams of the past had deep benches, but the Aces essentially use six players. “That is the most unique situation that I’ve ever seen,” Augustus said. “They have one of the fastest paces in the league and only have six people. And that’s because they figured out who they are. They know where their spots are, who’s doing well, how they’re doing it. And on any given night, any player can step up. And that’s what makes this team so great.” The Aces have won eight consecutive playoff games dating from Game 4 of the 2022 Finals, and a ninth would tie the WNBA record set by the 2001-02 Sparks and 2013-14 Lynx. They have won 11 straight games overall, and a 12th would match a franchise record set in 2012. Las Vegas has won by an average of 22.5 points during the Finals and handed the Liberty its first two consecutive losses of the season. The 38 points the Aces scored in the first quarter of Game 2 was the highest-scoring first quarter in Finals history, and their 31 total assists were the third most in a Finals game. During the regular season, Wilson, Plum, Young and Gray became the first four teammates in league history to average 15 points or more, and the team’s offensive efficiency rating of 113.0 set a record. Hammon skipped over all other WNBA teams to find a comparison for her squad and went to the 2014 NBA champion San Antonio Spurs, who featured Hall of Famers Tim Duncan, Manu Ginóbili and Tony Parker. She actually had her team watch tape of those Spurs. “At this point of the season, every play we try to run is scouted,” Hammon said. “If we try to run plays, their defense is pretty good. Our best offense has been no offense. Run, play out of the defense, play with pace, play with each other, cut, move the basketball. There’s no defense for it because you don’t know what we’re going to do, because we don’t know what you’re going to do. You do this; we do that. You do that; we do this. It’s just reading and playing a constant little game of chess of what are they doing and what’s available.” Wilson, Plum, Gray, Young and Clark are under contract for 2024 as the Aces attempt to build a dynasty. Clark is the oldest of the group at 36, and Gray is 31. The three No. 1 picks are under 30, and Wilson is firmly in her prime at 27 after averaging career highs in points (22.8), rebounds (9.5) and blocks (2.2). She became the first player in WNBA history to post three consecutive 30-plus-point postseason games this year. With her at the helm, the Aces are set to be contenders for the foreseeable future, and Hammon is still upset that Wilson wasn’t named this year’s regular season MVP. “This lady’s been ridiculous, and she’s heard it all,” Hammon said. “Third in MVP voting [behind New York’s Breanna Stewart and Connecticut’s Alyssa Thomas]. Okay. Rest on that. A joke. She’s been off the charts efficient. And I love [Stewart]. ... But her efficiency on both ends, it’s been ridiculous.” The Liberty isn’t trying to go out like this. New York was barely competitive in Game 2, but it also came into the series with championship aspirations as a super team after adding MVPs in Stewart and   and five-time all-star Courtney Vandersloot. During her meeting with the media, Stewart looked dazed after the Game 2 loss. And anger could be felt at Friday’s practice with the Liberty on the verge of elimination. “We know what’s at stake,” Coach Sandy Brondello said. “We’re all disappointed, angry, embarrassed with how we played. I think we had all those emotions, but it’s about action now, not emotion. It’s about what you can do, not how you feel. No f---ing feelings anymore. For me, it’s just compete. Compete and do it together The Aces have been adamant about keeping the focus small and not looking ahead despite being on the cusp of rare accomplishments. But a victory Sunday would put them among the greatest in WNBA history.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/14/wnba-back-to-back-champions/,Washington Post,2023-10-14 17:32:00,

That followed a missing-person report filed Dec. 7 concerning a woman identified as Marayna Rodgers, after which police began to suspect that Comanche and Harnden had a role in her disappearance. Based on information obtained after the arrests, police said, authorities recovered human remains in a “desert area” in Henderson, Nev. The remains were identified to be those of Rodgers by the Clark County (Nev.) coroner’s office. Accusing Comanche and Harnden of being responsible for Rodgers’s murder, police said they were coordinating with the Clark County district attorney’s office to amend the duo’s charges to open murder. According to online records from the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office, Comanche was booked there Friday under a section of California penal code related to the arrest of people wanted on charges originating outside the state. He was being held without bail. Two individuals have been arrested in connection with the disappearance and killing of a 23-year-old female after executing murder plan. Click below for additional information.  On the same day as his arrest, Comanche was released by the Stockton Kings, the G League affiliate of the Sacramento Kings. In a terse statement, the team did not specify a reason for the move. Las Vegas TV station   cited a warrant for first-degree kidnapping issued Friday in Las Vegas Justice Court in reporting Saturday that Rodgers was a 23-year-old resident of Washington state visiting Las Vegas. The LVMPD said Sunday that Harnden, described as a friend of Rodgers, invited the latter on Dec. 5 to “a pre-arranged meeting” to which Harnden brought Comanche. Rodgers had not been seen nor heard from since then, police said. Comanche was with the Stockton Kings when they played a game Dec. 5 in Henderson. The team then had a day off before a game in Portland, Ore. In what would become his final appearance with the Kings, Comanche scored 20 points Tuesday on 9-of-11 shooting, with 10 rebounds and three blocked shots, in a loss to the Salt Lake City Stars. Per online records from the Clark County Detention Center, Harnden was booked Wednesday on a charge of first-degree kidnapping and is being held on $500,000 bail. She has a preliminary hearing scheduled for Dec. 28. In addition, Harnden was booked on a charge of possession of stolen property, for which she has a hearing Tuesday. Comanche, a center listed in court records as 6-foot-11 and 235 pounds, has a court hearing set for Tuesday. He was in his second season with Stockton and appeared in one game last season for the Portland Trail Blazers.

United also sent $500,000 in general allocation money in the trade. “We are excited to welcome Aaron to D.C. United and we are thrilled to be securing an elite and proven defender in this league,” Mackay said in a news release. “Aaron has been one of the top fullbacks in MLS over the last couple of seasons and we think his style of play aligns with our philosophy and will significantly bolster our roster in that position. He has the defensive intuition combined with a desire to go forward and create goal-scoring opportunities.” Ruan, a 28-year-old Brazilian whose full name is Ruan Gregório Teixeira, recorded six assists in 24 appearances in his only season with United. The club acquired him from Orlando City in exchange for the No. 2 pick in last year’s MLS draft and exercised his contract option earlier this month. Herrera is expected to be United’s starter at right back after the club  , the veteran who split time at the position with Ruan last season.

"The administration of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is proposing to tackle a multibillion-dollar, long-term budget shortfall by imposing drastic cuts on transportation spending that would slow highway construction, reduce transit service and increase the cost of airport parking, according to a summary of the plans. The six-year plan, expected to be announced next week, calls for an 8 percent cut in the annual budgets of the state’s highway, transit, ports and airports agencies, along with the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). Construction budgets at most of the agencies would face even deeper cuts, according to the summary, parts of which were obtained by The Washington Post. The administration of Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is proposing to tackle a multibillion-dollar, long-term budget shortfall by imposing drastic cuts on transportation spending that would slow highway construction, reduce transit service and increase the cost of airport parking, according to a summary of the plans. The six-year plan, expected to be announced next week, calls for an 8 percent cut in the annual budgets of the state’s highway, transit, ports and airports agencies, along with the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). Construction budgets at most of the agencies would face even deeper cuts, according to the summary, parts of which were obtained by The Washington Post. Maryland faces an across-the-board budget crunch caused by lackluster economic conditions and the expense of key policy goals. But the outlook is worse for transportation projects scheduled to begin in several years, partly because of rising construction costs and declining revenue streams dedicated to paying for them. The biggest proposed cut is a $1.6 billion hit over six years to highway construction that would “defund all major expansion construction projects” not advertised by Jan. 1 and cut by 30 percent the budget for maintenance projects designed to keep roads and bridges in good condition. Transit construction faces a $652 million cut that similarly targets expansion projects. Projects underway or set to begin next year did not appear to be affected, according to the documents reviewed by The Post. The administration has proposed saving money in the short term by reducing transportation-related services, such as having less litter pickup and mowing along state highways. The Maryland Department of Transportation said the proposal reflects the need for the state to both tighten its belt and invest in the future at a time of inflation. “The Moore-[Aruna] Miller Administration has been clear about the challenging budget shortfalls facing Maryland that have long been forecasted to take place,” MDOT said in a statement. “The depths of those structural problems only became clearer over time.” The General Assembly could revise the proposal when it meets in the new year. The plan follows MDOT’s announcement in September of a $2.1 billion shortfall in its six-year construction budget, with revenue forecast to lag spending despite federal funds from the $1 trillion infrastructure law. A   by legislative analysts put the shortfall at $2.8 billion. The gap is a reflection of a troubled budget picture that has threatened to imperil the ambitious agenda of Moore, a Democrat finishing his first year in office. The state’s economy hasn’t kept pace with that of several other states. Maryland boasts the country’s lowest unemployment rate, but economists say that figure is fueled partly by jobseekers moving to other states. Moore   in August that budget cuts might be on the way because “our economic engine does not support our ambition.” A landmark education program designed to equalize and boost achievement, for example, is projected to cost roughly $4 billion annually when fully implemented. By fiscal 2028, however, the state will be at least $1.8 billion short each year, according to recent legislative estimates. Moore promised systemic change that would “leave no one behind,” pledging to end child poverty, expand economic opportunity and rebuild what he described as a hollowed-out state government. Next month, he’ll present a budget he says attempts to do that. Maryland budgets transportation spending separately from the rest of state government and on a six-year horizon, which is why the proposed transportation cuts are being announced separately. Aside from transportation, legislative analysts estimate that Moore also will have a roughly $400 million annual budget hole to close, amounting to about 1.3 percent of other scheduled state spending. Transportation construction has been especially hard-hit by inflation across the country, a factor that Maryland officials have said is partly responsible for the budget hole. At the same time, states are grappling with how to raise money from a growing number of electric vehicle drivers, who don’t pay the gas taxes that fund investments in new infrastructure. The shortfall also complicates Maryland’s ability to take advantage of the federal infrastructure law, which provides the state billions in new money that must be partially matched. Officials said in September that the budget gap could mean tough decisions about how to use federal money. In its statement Friday, MDOT said the plan protects $7 billion in federal investments in transportation. The state’s proposed transportation plan calls for service cuts and increases in fees that would be directly felt across the state, and potentially affect high-profile projects. Its summary says only the planning funds for the Red Line transit system in Baltimore would be maintained. It does not mention the American Legion Bridge connecting Maryland and Virginia but says planning funds for key projects would be protected. The implications of the proposals for the Washington region’s Metro system aren’t clear. The plan’s summary notes the transit system is facing a $750 million deficit as ridership lags in the wake of the pandemic. Officials in Maryland, Virginia and the District, which share responsibility for funding the system, are in discussions about providing more money to help close the gap. The summary of Maryland’s plans includes increasing MVA fees by $40 million a year, while closing two branch offices in Montgomery and Baltimore counties, as well as imposing a hiring freeze. Officials would seek to raise $30 million a year by increasing parking fees at Baltimore-Washington Marshall International Airport and its rail station, while increasing airport drop-off and pickup fees for ride-sharing services. The proposal also calls for eliminating commuter bus service and abandoning a planned expansion of service on MARC’s Brunswick Line. It calls for eliminating or reducing “inefficient” service on other transit lines without affecting core operations in Baltimore. The cuts would delay a transition to electric buses, according to the summary. The summary says a dozen major highway projects would be defunded, affecting a stretch of U.S. 15 in Frederick, a stretch of Interstate 81 in Washington County, the widening of Interstate 97 in Anne Arundel County and a Capital Beltway interchange in Prince George’s County. Spending on airport construction would largely be spared because of restrictions imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the summary. The plans were laid out privately to lawmakers this week, according to people familiar with the briefings, and are expected to be publicly unveiled in the coming days. The General Assembly approves final spending plans before they take effect and will have some discretion to make changes. Maryland has established a commission to address long-term transportation funding issues. It is scheduled to meet Dec. 13 and lay out preliminary recommendations to raise money.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/12/01/maryland-transportation-cuts-moore/,Washington Post,2023-12-01 19:19:00,
"A federal judge in Georgia signed off Thursday on congressional districts redrawn this month by the state’s Republican-led legislature, ruling that the new map did not continue to illegally dilute the power of Black voters as Democrats and civil rights groups have argued. “The Court finds that the General Assembly fully complied with this Court’s order requiring the creation of Black-majority districts in the regions of the State where vote dilution was found,” wrote U.S. District Judge Steve C.

A federal judge in Georgia signed off Thursday on congressional districts redrawn this month by the state’s Republican-led legislature, ruling that the new map did not continue to illegally dilute the power of Black voters as Democrats and civil rights groups have argued. “The Court finds that the General Assembly fully complied with this Court’s order requiring the creation of Black-majority districts in the regions of the State where vote dilution was found,” wrote U.S. District Judge Steve C.

The ruling by Jones, an appointee of President Barack Obama, is likely to maintain the 9-5 majority that Republicans hold in Georgia’s delegation to the U.S. House. Georgia is among several states where   could affect the makeup of the U.S. House next year. In October, Jones found that Georgia’s congressional map, which was previously redrawn by Republican lawmakers in 2021,  , writing that Black voters in Georgia have “suffered significant harm.” In response to that ruling, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) ordered the General Assembly to convene a special session starting Nov. 29 to redraw the maps. On Dec. 8, Kemp signed into law a new congressional map. The map added a new majority-Black district on Atlanta’s west side. But it significantly altered a majority non-White district represented by Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) in a way that Democrats say is designed to be favorable to Rep. Richard McCormick (R-Ga.). Georgia lawmakers rejected a plan drawn by Democrats that would have protected McBath’s district and combined McCormick’s with one already represented by a Republican. At a hearing last week before Jones, Democrats argued that the Republican-passed map did not comply with the judge’s original order and did not give Black voters sufficient power. In a statement Thursday, the Democratic Party of Georgia said it was “disappointed” in the judge’s ruling. “Georgia Democrats fought hard for maps that would ensure Black voters had a fair chance to make their voices heard, but Republicans once again played partisan games with redistricting,” Kevin Olasanoye, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “While we respect the court’s ruling, we are more committed than ever to ending Republicans’ days of diluting minority voting power via gerrymandering.” McBath, who was reelected in 2022 with 61 percent of the vote, has vowed to try to stay in Congress regardless of the reconfigured map.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/28/georgia-congressional-maps-approved-judge-redistricting/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 16:21:00,
"The Orix Buffaloes officially posted the most coveted Japanese free agent since Shohei Ohtani on Monday when they made 25-year-old ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto available to Major League Baseball teams after a decorated career in Nippon Professional Baseball. Beginning Tuesday, Yamamoto has 45 days to negotiate a deal with a major league team. The Orix Buffaloes officially posted the most coveted Japanese free agent since Shohei Ohtani on Monday when they made 25-year-old ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto available to Major League Baseball teams after a decorated career in Nippon Professional Baseball. Beginning Tuesday, Yamamoto has 45 days to negotiate a deal with a major league team. Yamamoto, a right-hander, is one of the premier starters in recent Japanese league history with two Pacific League MVP awards, three Pacific League ERA titles and the past three Sawamura Awards (the equivalent of the Cy Young) to his name. Since he debuted for the Buffaloes in 2017, Yamamoto has compiled a record of 70-29 and a 1.82 ERA with 922 strikeouts in 897 innings. His last outing of the 2023 season came just weeks ago in Game 6 of the Japan Series and was the stuff of legend: He threw 138 pitches and struck out 14 to help the Buffaloes reach Game 7. That résumé will propel him to the top of a highly competitive market for elite starting pitching, one that grew even more competitive when the Philadelphia Phillies agreed to re-sign ace Aaron Nola to a seven-year contract Sunday. Nola and Yamamoto projected to be the best right-handers available and therefore seemed likely to be pursued by all of the most aggressive spenders, including the New York Yankees, New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. With Nola off the market, Yamamoto’s bidding process will become even more frenzied, though in reality it began months ago when executives including Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman and Dodgers President Andrew Friedman traveled to Japan to see him in person. To the extent that there are concerns about Yamamoto, they are related to his size. At 5-foot-10, Yamamoto throws a high-90s fastball. That combination of size and velocity raises questions about durability, but he has avoided major injury. Still, with almost every major-market team hunting top-tier starting pitching and only a few options available, executives expect it will require a nine-figure deal to sign him — maybe even one that begins with a two. That market should also reward another Japanese starter, lefty Shota Imanaga, who is expected to be posted by the Yokohama DeNA Baystars soon. Imanaga started the final game of the World Baseball Classic against the United States and had a 2.66 ERA in 24 Nippon league starts this year. That Japanese pitchers will play a larger-than-normal role in this year’s free agent market is only fitting given that the undisputed king of this year’s free agent class is Ohtani,  who would have been the best starting pitcher available had he not  . And agents are already jockeying to represent the next big Japanese star, young ace Roki Sasaki, who is not expected to be posted for a few more seasons. Given the importance of Japanese stars to this year’s free agent proceedings, the growing ease of scouting players from afar in an age when more games are streamed online and more advanced stats are available, and the symbolic importance of   in this year’s star-studded World Baseball Classic, more MLB teams are turning to Japan for polished, big-league-ready performers than ever. Often what evaluators are looking for is how those players succeed against the strengths of Japanese competition and how that might translate against the strengths emphasized in the American game. For example, will Yamamoto’s fastball play the same against big league hitters who see 98 mph every night as it did against Japanese hitters who do not see that velocity as regularly? “I think what you’re really looking for is players whose swings will translate, pitchers whose pitches will translate, and a lot of times experienced scouts who have seen a lot of major leaguers can get a sense of what that adaptation might look like,” said Farhan Zaidi, president of baseball operations for the San Francisco Giants. “For us, I think it’s as much about getting experienced eyes on these players, and that’s where things like the World Baseball Classic, where they face big league players from other countries, that provides that.” Teams pursuing top-end Japanese free agents must also account for the uncertainty provided by the human element. Moving across the world to a foreign country to be surrounded by teammates who speak different languages and arrived there via very different routes can be isolating personally as well as difficult professionally. But many of the teams expected to pursue Yamamoto this offseason — including the  , the Mets with Kodai Senga, the Toronto Blue Jays with Yusei Kikuchi, the Boston Red Sox with Masataka Yoshida and the Chicago Cubs with Seiya Suzuki — have players on their roster who could ease the transition. Other teams, such as the Yankees and Seattle Mariners, have long histories with Japanese stars and histories of creating comfortable environments for them. “I don’t want to say it’s getting easier because I’ve never been through that transition and I can’t understand what goes into it. I can’t imagine having to go to another country and having to assimilate the way those players do,” Texas Rangers General Manager Chris Young said. “But what I do believe to be true is that there have been a number of players who have come over and really paved the way, who are great resources for players coming over today. When you have somebody who has done it before you, it helps immensely.” Even as more Japanese players establish themselves in American markets, the extent to which major league teams focus their energy on recruiting in Japan still varies dramatically. For some teams, such as the Washington Nationals, their reticence to bid on big-name Japanese free agents in recent years has largely been financial. “We cover it. We’ve got a good feel for all the Asian players coming over, and if we were to play in that market — meaning that price point — we would,” said Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo, whose team is not expected to bid on any high-priced free agents this offseason, according to multiple people familiar with its plans. Some teams have seemed like less credible players for Japanese stars purely because of geography. The Baltimore Orioles, for example, could use starting pitching. “There’s not enough pitching to go around, so the more that can come from all corners of the world, we’ll welcome them here in the major leagues,” said Orioles General Manager Mike Elias, whose team acquired Japanese reliever Shintaro Fujinami at last season’s trade deadline and has been in contact with his representatives since. “There’s just a long track record of success of Japanese pitchers making the transition to the major leagues. . . . I don’t know that we’re as active scouting as a California team or like Seattle, but we keep our eye on it.” In many cases, including Yamamoto’s, the talent coming from Japan does not exactly need to be unearthed because it is almost impossible to miss. Star after star — and more specifically proven starter after proven starter — has transitioned to the majors and built a résumé defined by the same kind of consistency and durability that propelled him in the Nippon league. The bidding war about to begin for Yamamoto suggests most of baseball believes he will be the latest, with more and more to come.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/20/yoshinobu-yamamoto-mlb-free-agent/,Washington Post,2023-11-20 14:49:00,
"It was 1989. D.C. had recently been dubbed the murder capital of the United States, and the crack wars were raging. Then-D.C. Mayor Marion Barry (D) and council members were called before Congress to testify about what was going on in the  nation’s capital, and they came bearing news. The city had just passed an anti-loitering law that allowed police to establish “illegal drug zones,” had set a curfew for juveniles and beefed up pretrial detention. It was 1989. D.C. had recently been dubbed the murder capital of the United States, and the crack wars were raging. Then-D.C. Mayor Marion Barry (D) and council members were called before Congress to testify about what was going on in the  nation’s capital, and they came bearing news. The city had just passed an anti-loitering law that allowed police to establish “illegal drug zones,” had set a curfew for juveniles and beefed up pretrial detention. If that feels a little like déjà vu, it’s because Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) is recycling the same ideas more than 30 years later, as the District confronts   that has drawn comparisons to the city’s bloodiest era, even though today’s underlying causes bear less similarity. Most recently, the mayor   a proposal to revive those “anti-loitering” and “drug-free zones,” which would allow police to cordon off temporary zones for five days where anyone congregating to use, buy or sell drugs can be arrested if they don’t leave. The proposal is a throwback to a ’90s-era approach to cracking down on then-prolific open-air drug markets, a problem that has not been front-and-center in D.C. for years. Now, however, at a time when the major drivers of violent crime are not tied to drugs as they once were, Bowser may encounter some resistance to resurrecting the policy — primarily because of its history of drawing legal challenges and racial profiling concerns. The 1989 iteration of the law was struck down in court as unconstitutional. The 1996 version that replaced it — and which Bowser’s proposal would revive — was never challenged in court but was repealed by the D.C. Council in 2014 when the attorney general’s office raised concerns that it ran afoul of the Constitution. Bowser herself, then a council member, voted for the repeal. In rolling out the policy, Bowser and top officials expressed confidence it was legally sound and said it addressed what she described as a troubling “emerging trend”: plain-view drug dealing and use, visible in some of the District’s busiest corridors such as Chinatown and H Street. Bowser has acknowledged the problem is nowhere near what it once was, saying officials believe there are fewer than 10 such “open-air drug markets” today, compared with an estimated 60 in 2002. Still, Bowser’s top public safety officials, including acting Police Chief Pamela A. Smith, believe those problems can spill into violence or create other dangers. They declined to identify suspected locations. “We want to blunt a trend we see in open-air drug dealing that we have pretty much squelched in this city” in all but a few areas, Bowser said, “and we don’t want that activity to proliferate.” Council member Brooke Pinto (D-Ward 2), who chairs the public safety committee, welcomed Bowser’s proposal, noting that she has heard concerns across the city about hot spots for drug dealing or criminal activity, fearing police don’t have adequate tools to disrupt them. “This trend cannot continue without intervention,” she said. But skepticism is already simmering. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) threw cold water on the idea in an interview last week, doubting its relevance to D.C.’s  violent-crime spike, driven by carjackings and homicides. He said he supported the idea of drug-free zones — and prostitution-free zones — more than a decade ago, but, citing the 2014 concerns from the attorney general’s office and the American Civil Liberties Union, he questioned whether Bowser’s proposal would hold up to legal scrutiny. “I don’t oppose [anti-loitering statutes]. They’re just unconstitutional,” he said — an unsettled question that could drive debate within the council. Pinto said she would hold a hearing on the legislation on Nov. 29. Bowser’s proposal to revive the anti-loitering drug zones is a key facet of her Addressing Crime Trends Now Act, which would also target “organized retail theft” and roll back various provisions of D.C.’s major police reform legislation, passed after George Floyd’s murder. Bowser has also called on the council to pass her May  , which would permanently expand pretrial detention for juveniles and adults charged with violent crimes and enhance gun penalties, among other things. In recent years, cracking down on drug-dealing or drug-related loitering had not made up a significant part of city leaders’ crime strategy — but they’ve pointed to  growing concerns about these issues among residents, raised in community meetings and in online neighborhood forums. Chinatown offers one example. In its   on the Gallery Place-Chinatown corridor, the DowntownDC Business Improvement District cited “visible drug sales” as a “complex challenge,” along with a growing number of homeless people and panhandlers, and called for “stronger police presence to disrupt drug sales activities.” (The DowntownDC BID did not respond to a request for comment.) During   a representative for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Wizards and Capitals, decried the “open-air drug transactions” outside of Capital One Arena, and residents   due to both petty crime and serious violence. Howard Marks, vice president of the condo board for the Residences at Gallery Place, right next to the Metro station, said he and his neighbors were “totally thrilled” after Bowser unveiled the plan to revive anti-loitering drug free zones. Marks had moved into his condo building in 2014, back when “there was a certain rhythm” to the neighborhood, he said, a sense of safety and ease on vibrant streets. The offices were filled. Since-shuttered Bed Bath & Beyond was busy with shoppers right downstairs. “Then covid hit, and everything changed,” Marks said. “Once the office workers left to work from home, the streets were virtually empty, and — if I can use the word without offending anyone — miscreants suddenly became larger than life,” he said. Drug deals seemed  commonplace right beneath the historic Chinatown arch, and sometimes he smelled marijuana as he walked to and from home. Fare evaders hopped the gates and loitered at the top of the Metro station escalators. Reckless e-scooter riders whizzed past, contributing to a “sense of chaos” that took over, he said. But there’s little police can do about loitering unless they’re catching a drug dealer red-handed, and by the mid-2010s, D.C. moved away from plainclothes street officers going after small-time dealers on the corner  In a statement, Paris Lewbel, a police spokesman, said drug-related investigations “are difficult cases to make, and too often don’t provide immediate or lasting relief to our communities because only a few people are arrested and may be quickly back on the street.” Bringing back drug-free zones, he said, would “help disperse and interrupt this activity and help neighborhoods and businesses reclaim and clean up public space.” In its many variations, the anti-loitering approach has a long history of trial and error. Go back far enough and, even in the middle of a world war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the time to veto a 1941 D.C. “vagrancy” statute — a Jim Crow-era specialty often targeting Black people and poor people — over fears police couldn’t be trusted not to misuse it. A more tailored D.C. “narcotics vagrancy” law was struck down in federal court in 1968. And year after year,  as drug-related crime became a more urgent problem, the D.C. Council kept trying to bring it back. D.C. Housing Authority Police Chief Joel Maupin remembers when Barry and the council enacted a in 1989. Then a street officer for D.C. police patrolling Southeast’s 7th district, Maupin made one of the first arrests under the law. “That was during the time when PCP was frequent in the streets, and crack cocaine was very prevalent,” Maupin said. “So drug-free zones, during that time frame, it was very much needed. … There was a lot of violence associated with crack cocaine. Now violence is most associated with anything or everything, it appears.” According to a  that studied the underlying causes of homicides in D.C., about 15 percent of the 274 killings where circumstances were known were tied to drug disputes or drug robberies — a different picture from the  , and 41 percent in 1990. Still, even then, Maupin said he did not recall the law being frequently used, in part because “it didn’t last very long,” he said. Days before Barry’s   on crack cocaine possession charges, in January 1990, a D.C. judge struck down the “Illegal Drug Zone” emergency act as unconstitutional. The problem, the court found, was that even though the intent was to squash suspected drug users or dealers, the law was so broad that it could apply to innocent people doing anything — even merely existing — in the targeted zone. The council apparently learned from that case, and sought to draft a narrower law in 1996 — the version Bowser is seeking to revive in nearly identical fashion. Its champion, former council member Bill Lightfoot (I-At Large), says his legislation was also spurred by concerns from the community, like citizen patrol groups who had expressed unease about the proliferation of prostitution and open-air drug markets. “Public safety has to be the priority. The rights of criminals have some bearing, but the role of government is to protect citizens,” said Lightfoot, who remains a close adviser to Bowser. “We were dealing with a crack cocaine epidemic, we had been named the murder capital ... and [the council] took an attitude toward violent crime that it was not going to be tolerated.” Under both the 1996 law and Bowser’s proposal, police would issue notices to residents in and around an established zone, stating that for up to five days, it would be unlawful to congregate “for the purposes of participating in the use, purchase, or sale of illegal drugs.” Police could only arrest people they “reasonably believe” are involved in drug activity if they ignore orders to disperse. But in 2014, as the council debated whether to repeal the measure, the attorney general’s office cited due process concerns with the law. Andrew Fois, then the deputy attorney general, wrote in a letter that the law failed to sufficiently consider a person’s intent to engage in illegal activity among the elements of the crime. On Oct. 27, D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb (D) said on the Politics Hour with Kojo Nnamdi that he was reviewing those due process concerns now. A day after this article published, a spokesman for the attorney general’s office said the office completed its review and pointed to a memo stating Bowser’s legislation was “legally sufficient”; the reasoning was not given in the memo. Arthur Spitzer, senior legal counsel at the ACLU, said that in his view, the primary concern is about how police would make arrests. “Reasonable belief” that someone is engaged in drug activity is up for interpretation, he said, even if Bowser’s bill lists various criteria like “operating as a lookout” or exchanging “small packages.” It could allow police to make arrests under a lower standard than probable cause, which Spitzer said raises a red flag and spells legal trouble. But, legal concerns aside, Spitzer questioned whether the approach will really make the impact leaders are hoping for. “Designating a zone is just going to drive the market a couple streets over, and what good does that do, really?” he said. “It makes the people on this block happier for a while, but makes people on the next block suffer the same problems.” While officials won’t say exactly where the open-air drug markets are today, recently, the U.S. attorney’s office   from six men tied to one operating around a Shell gas station on South Capitol Street SE. While naming drugs of concern, Smith said that   and fentanyl topped the list. And while the use and possession of marijuana is legal in the District — though not to smoke in public or to buy or sell — Bowser said that the city’s inability to tax and regulate the drug has also contributed to violence, a problem prosecutors described as happening at the gas station. Bowser and Lindsey Appiah, deputy mayor of public safety and justice, have brushed aside legal concerns, noting that the former law never was actually challenged in the 18 years it was on the books. A similar anti-loitering drug-free zone law was  in 2001 — but Bowser said this week that this did not concern her, and Appiah said she was not familiar with the case. Appiah cited a   as part of the research she reviewed that led her to believe the District’s policy is sound. The brief was about school-related drug-free zones, however — and according to the Sentencing Project, it has nothing to do with Bowser’s proposal. “Not even relevant,” acting director Kara Gotsch said. Gotsch said it was puzzling to hear Appiah cite her organization, which does not endorse Bowser’s proposal and  to not cite them again. (Appiah insisted the briefing was relevant when asked about Gotsch’s objection.) It was more puzzling, Gotsch said, to see the Bowser administration seeking to revive the law so many years after it was repealed. “Arresting more people for loitering because they might be involved in drug use or possess drugs is not how we solve our drug problem,” Gotsch said, noting concerns about racially disproportionate enforcement as well. While it’s not yet clear where drug-free zones would be set up if Bowser’s proposal were to pass, some lawmakers have started to poke around. Council member Zachary Parker (D-Ward 5) asked Maupin at a D.C. Housing Authority hearing whether public housing complexes might be targeted, as they were back when the law first came into use in ’89. Maupin said there had not yet been discussions. “Unfortunately,” Parker said, “we’re coming full circle having to think about implementing that again.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/05/dc-mayor-drug-markets-bill/,Washington Post,2023-11-06 17:34:00,
"JERUSALEM — Israel’s spreading ground war across the   is sending new waves of displaced people into the enclave’s overcrowded south, where locals are already underfed and desperate under continuing bombardment. Efforts to deliver medical supplies and fuel to the hospitals still functioning in and around the southern city of Rafah have been increasingly disrupted by hungry people  , the World Health Organization said this week. JERUSALEM — Israel’s spreading ground war across the   is sending new waves of displaced people into the enclave’s overcrowded south, where locals are already underfed and desperate under continuing bombardment. Efforts to deliver medical supplies and fuel to the hospitals still functioning in and around the southern city of Rafah have been increasingly disrupted by hungry people  , the World Health Organization said this week. Twelve weeks into Israel’s campaign to root out  , more than 21,000 people in Gaza have been killed and there’s little relief in sight. Talks in Cairo, and an Egyptian cease-fire proposal, appear to be in early stages, and Hamas says it will not return Israeli hostages until the fighting stops. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting Gaza this week, said the war “ .” Hamas and allied fighters attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking 240 more hostage, triggering current hostilities. Before that surprise attack, the U.N. agency for Palestinian affairs says, Israel allowed about 500 trucks carrying food, fuel and commercial supplies into the blockaded enclave each day. The wartime average of 80 to 100 trucks “is not anything close to enough,” said Juliette Touma, Director of Communications for the agency, known as UNRWA. “We are forced to make decisions that no humanitarian should make on who do we give to, when and how much,” she said. “In many cases we are forced to deliver a can of tuna or a bottle of water to a family of six or seven people.” The Israeli prime minister’s office said this week that delays in delivering aid to Gaza were not Israel’s fault. U.N. agencies are “struggling to distribute aid at the pace that Israel is inspecting it,” spokesman Eylon Levy said Wednesday. “Unfortunately, to date, the U.N. aid mechanism has been woefully unsuccessful because it goes through UNRWA. Aid isn’t reaching the people who need it because Hamas hijacks it and UNRWA covers up for it.” Touma said the problem was a “combination” of Israeli restrictions on the number of trucks and intensive checks on the goods going in. About 1.8 million of Gaza’s 2.2 million residents depend on UNRWA for humanitarian aid, Touma said. Of those, about 1.4 million are sheltering in U.N. facilities. The other 400,000 have set up informal camps nearby. “With the ongoing bombardments, you cannot deliver aid in a place with a sky full of airstrikes,” she said. “The restrictions imposed on movement across the Gaza Strip ... means we are missing people in the north on a regular basis.” Incidents of desperate Gazans breaking into storage areas or stopping trucks to take food items that they eat on the spot appear to be rising. Breakdowns in civil order are no surprise to Shawqi Salman. The 39-year-old father of four on Thursday spent his third day in a row at a crowded UNRWA distribution center in Rafah hoping to receive two bags of flour. He went away empty-handed, again. UNRWA initially gave flour, one of its main aid items, to bakeries. When fuel shortages caused bakeries to close, the agency began distributing it directly to families. “Unfortunately, goods are scarce in the market, and purchasing anything is nearly impossible,” Salman told The Washington Post. Food, including black-market flour, sells for five or 10 times the prewar price. “What is available comes with exorbitant prices, and we can’t afford much.” Yasmine Rafiq, 22, has not yet made the trek to Rafah. She’s staying with her family of seven in a tent at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir el-Balah, the only functioning hospital in central Gaza, in an area that the Israel Defense Forces has not yet ordered people to evacuate. Three times one of her brothers has pushed through the crowd at a distribution center to get a coveted food box with biscuits, sugar, salt, canned beans and mortadella. The family quickly finished it. “We mostly buy items from the market, but the prices are very high,” Rafiq told The Post. “After waiting four days, we received three bags of flour from UNRWA.” Gazans with extra food or fuel have tried to fill some of the gaps. A local charity worker said the Emirates Red Crescent was providing his group with twice-weekly donations. “The small quantities sent to Gaza are not due to a lack of support but rather due to the capacity of the crossings in the Gaza Strip,” the worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being inundated with requests for help, told The Post by phone. His group has focused on assisting Gazans who aren’t in UNRWA facilities. The group uses cars rather then trucks to avoid being stopped on the road while distributing food, medicine, clothing, mattresses and blankets. The charity relies on a database for distribution, “but the movement of the population every day or every moment increases the burden on us,” he said. “Most of the residents here, whether residents or displaced people, lost everything and left their homes without any clothes or supplies.” Gazans have crowded into Rafah, but no place in the enclave is safe. A missile strike on two houses near the Kuwaiti Hospital killed at least 18 people and wounded dozens, hospital director Suhaib al-Hams said. The victims included women and children. “We received some bodies cut into pieces,” Hams told The Post. “Some of them were identified as internally displaced people who came from the northern regions and Gaza City.” Ahmed Qanan and his family fled Khan Younis for Rafah this week. On Thursday evening, the 38-year-old prayed and then gathered with his children to chat. “We were talking about our wishes for a cease-fire so that we could return to our home, but we were surprised by a big explosion in the house next to our house,” he said. Shrapnel hit Qanan in the head and neck, he said. The IDF did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Biden administration is pressing Israel to transition from high-intensity strikes to targeted assaults, but there’s no indication that Israel has changed its approach. “We are expanding the fight in the coming days,” Netanyahu said this week. “This will be a long battle.” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to travel to the Middle East next week to discuss the  , Israeli media has reported. He is expected to push for a humanitarian pause in the fighting. Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi, meeting in Cairo on Wednesday, stressed the need for more aid and said they opposed any Israeli attempt to expel Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt’s Sinai region. They said in a statement that the international community should pressure Israel to agree to an immediate cease-fire and allow more aid into Gaza. Diaa Rashwan, the chairman of Egypt’s State Information Service, told The Post that the government was proposing to end the conflict in three stages leading to a cease-fire. The Biden administration has been pushing for the Palestinian Authority, which administers a portion of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to return to run Gaza after the war ends. Netanyahu has called that idea “ ” but has not said who he believes should run Gaza after the war. He has said Israel will maintain control of security around Gaza, at least temporarily, and talked about establishing a half-mile-wide buffer zone inside Gaza. Netanyahu and members of his emergency war cabinet were scheduled Thursday night to take up, for the first time, the topic of Gaza’s postwar governance, but the meeting was postponed. Reports circulated that Israel had proposed a new hostage exchange, but a senior Hamas official waved the suggestion away. “Every once in a while they [the Israelis] try to send a new thing, but the stance of the movement until now has not changed,” Basem Naim told The Post from Doha, Qatar. “No negotiations before cessation of hostilities.” .",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/28/israel-gaza-rafah-humanitarian-strikes/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 14:47:00,

"Twenty-six teams remained in contention for a playoff berth to one degree or another as Week 16 opened, but Christmas brings with it two of the biggest matchups of the season: the Dallas Cowboys facing the Miami Dolphins on the road and the San Francisco 49ers hosting the Baltimore Ravens. The Cowboys-Dolphins game is the first in NFL history between teams with 20 or more combined wins and one (or zero) against teams with a better-than-.500 record. Dallas is 9-1 against teams with a .500-or-worse record and 1-3 against teams above .500. Miami is 10-1 against .500-or-worse teams and 0-3 against teams above .500. Twenty-six teams remained in contention for a playoff berth to one degree or another as Week 16 opened, but Christmas brings with it two of the biggest matchups of the season: the Dallas Cowboys facing the Miami Dolphins on the road and the San Francisco 49ers hosting the Baltimore Ravens. The Cowboys-Dolphins game is the first in NFL history between teams with 20 or more combined wins and one (or zero) against teams with a better-than-.500 record. Dallas is 9-1 against teams with a .500-or-worse record and 1-3 against teams above .500. Miami is 10-1 against .500-or-worse teams and 0-3 against teams above .500. The Ravens-49ers game features a Baltimore team that is 6-1 on the road against a San Francisco team that is 5-1 at home. Here’s a look at some other interesting facts about Week 16.  Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua caught five passes for 50 yards last week to become just the fifth rookie since the NFL started tracking the stat in 1932 to have nine or more games of five or more receptions and 50 or more receiving yards in a season.  In “the year of the backup quarterback,” every first-place team has started the same quarterback all season. Pittsburgh is giving Mason Rudolph (5-4-1 in starts) his first start since Nov. 14, 2021.  With James Cook running for 179 yards on 25 carries, Buffalo negated Dallas’s high-powered offense with methodical drives that lessened the pressure on Josh Allen and provided a major problem for any team Buffalo plays in the postseason, provided it gets there, to solve. Indianapolis is averaging 24.6 points — nearly two points better than the Chiefs, for instance — and is 5-1 since Halloween. Atlanta has switched from Desmond Ridder to Taylor Heinicke after a loss to Carolina in which Ridder committed his sixth red-zone turnover. Only three players have had more.  Green Bay got to 6-6 after a 2-5 start but has lost two in a row, its first December defeats since 2018.  Beware of Joe Flacco, Cleveland’s fourth starting quarterback. The 38-year-old has led   game-winning drives, which may make him the ideal quarterback for a team that is 5-0 in games decided by three or fewer points.  With a quarterback carousel that seems to have stopped at Nick Mullens, Minnesota remains in the playoff picture. Mullens completed 26 of 33 passes for 303 yards and two touchdowns in the overtime loss to Cincinnati last week.  The Jets have used 11 combinations on the offensive line. Their most recent iteration allowed six sacks and 14 quarterback hits in a loss to Miami that ensured they would miss the playoffs for the 13th straight season. Doctors: Sorry,  . We can’t clear you.  Rodgers: Based on your medical opinion? Doctors: No, based on your offensive line.  Seattle’s 92-yard game-winning touchdown drive against Philadelphia on Monday night was only the Seahawks’ second game-winning touchdown drive of 90 or more yards in the last two minutes of a game in the Pete Carroll era (since 2010).  Baker Mayfield passed for 381 yards and four touchdowns (to four different receivers) with a perfect 158.3 passer rating in a win over Green Bay last week, made more significant by the fact that he is only the third player in NFL history with at least 375 passing yards, four touchdown passes and a 158.3 rating in a road game. Through 14 games: 2022 Tom Brady 6-8 W-L 20-7 TD-INT 6.3 Yds/att 89.1 Pass rtg 2023 Baker Mayfield 7-7 W-L 24-8 TD-INT 7.1 Yds/att 94.7 Pass rtg  The last thing Bears fans want to see is a Panthers victory; Chicago has Carolina’s first-round pick in the 2024 draft. The next-to-last thing they want to see is a victory by their team. Chicago currently has the No. 1 pick from Carolina and its own No. 5 pick.  Miami has a two-game division lead over Buffalo, but the Dolphins’ next two opponents (Dallas and Baltimore) are 20-7; Buffalo’s next two (Chargers and New England) are 8-20. The Dolphins host the Bills in Week 18.  As Denver won six of eight games before Week 15, its defense allowed only 16 points per game, but it allowed five straight touchdown drives that took 4:07 or less (even though each went for 60 or more yards) in a loss to Detroit. The Broncos gave up 42 points, the most they had surrendered since Week 3.  The Chiefs may have beaten the Patriots by what in 2023 was a fairly comfortable margin (i.e., 10 points), but the offense still sputtered, failing for the fifth straight game to generate more than 400 yards (326). That’s tied for the longest such streak in the Patrick Mahomes era.  Philadelphia is playing poorly at the exact wrong time and has a three-game losing streak — its first since Weeks 2 to 4 of the 2021 season — to show for it. In each of their four losses, the Eagles have been held under 20 points. Jalen Hurts is tied for the NFL lead with a career-high 17 turnovers; he had eight last season.  San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy has had a passer rating of 130 or better in six games, tying Aaron Rodgers (2011 and 2020), Tony Romo (2014) and Ryan Tannehill and Russell Wilson (both in 2019) for the most in NFL history.

"On Nov. 26, 1993, the Georgetown and Maryland men’s basketball teams met for the first time in 13 years in a nationally televised season-opening game at USAir Arena.

On Nov. 26, 1993, the Georgetown and Maryland men’s basketball teams met for the first time in 13 years in a nationally televised season-opening game at USAir Arena. With 13 seconds remaining in overtime and Maryland trailing the 15th-ranked Hoyas by one, Terrapins sophomore guard Duane Simpkins penetrated into the lane and lofted a floater over the outstretched hand of Georgetown forward Don Reid. Thirty years later, Simpkins’s game-winning shot still resonates. It marked the turning point for a Maryland program that had been surpassed and then shunned by Georgetown over the previous decade, and it helped tilt the college basketball balance of power in the D.C. area back to College Park. “That game gave us and our fans the idea that we could be good again,” Hall of Fame Maryland Coach Gary Williams, who was in his fifth season with the Terrapins, said in a recent phone interview. “It certainly has a place among the most significant games in the history of Maryland basketball.” The first recorded meeting between Georgetown and Maryland after Maryland began fielding a varsity team took place Feb. 15, 1911, at the Arcade Rink in Columbia Heights. The quality of play left something to be desired. “Both teams showed a lack of everything that goes to make up the game but aggressiveness, but despite all the faulty playing this feature and the closeness of the score kept the attention of the spectators,” The Washington Post reported after Georgetown’s win. With the exception of three years during World War II, Georgetown and Maryland   from 1934-35 to 1975-76. From 1951 to 1964, the schools played a home-and-home series, with one game in D.C. and one game in College Park, every year. The rivalry intensified when Coach Lefty Driesell arrived at Maryland in 1969 and Georgetown hired John Thompson three years later. Everything changed Dec. 5, 1979, when   in the second game of a local doubleheader at the D.C. Armory. Incidentally, American, which was coached by Williams at the time, lost to Navy in the event’s first contest. With less than five minutes remaining in the first half and the Hoyas holding a slim lead, Georgetown center Ed Spriggs was called for a technical foul for hanging on the rim. As Thompson protested the call, Maryland forward Ernest Graham walked over and patted him on the head. “I was just telling him that he was too big to get that mad,” Graham said afterward. Thompson, who was angry that Driesell had lobbied for the call, gestured toward the Maryland bench. A heated verbal altercation between the coaches ensued, and they didn’t shake hands after the Hoyas’ 83-71 win. “I’m upset about it,” Driesell, who was without injured center Buck Williams, told reporters after the game. “Yeah, in fact I’m real upset at [Thompson]. But no, I ain’t going to comment any further. I got nothing else to say about it. … If we’d had the best center in the country in the game, I think we would’ve whipped their tails.” Georgetown and Maryland met again three months later, in the regional semifinals of the 1980 NCAA tournament in Philadelphia. Thompson and Driesell shook hands after the Hoyas’  , which would be the schools’ last showdown for more than a decade. Factors beyond the frosty relationship between Thompson and Driesell contributed to the series going dormant. Georgia Tech had recently joined the ACC, adding two more conference games to Maryland’s schedule. The Big East, which was founded in 1979, added Villanova as its eighth member in 1980 and moved to a schedule in which teams played each other twice every season. Nonconference schedules were de-emphasized. Georgetown enjoyed a decade of dominance under Thompson,   and making two other trips to the championship game. Maryland fell on hard times after Len Bias’s  . Gary Williams   as coach in 1989, tasked with rebuilding a program put on probation by the NCAA for  , Bob Wade. Williams was immediately interested in reviving the rivalry with Georgetown, but Thompson, whose team was the preeminent college basketball program in the area, decided he had nothing to gain by playing Maryland. When the Big East added two December conference games in 1993, Thompson, looking for an early-season tuneup, finally relented. “We were just so happy to be able to play him,” Williams said. “We would’ve played that game on campus at McDonough [Arena] if that’s what it took.” Former Virginia state senator Russ Potts, who formed a sports marketing firm after working in the Maryland athletic department from 1970 to 1977, was instrumental in organizing the game. “Ten years it took me to pull this off,” Potts, who guaranteed Georgetown and Maryland $125,000 to play, told The Post in 1993. “One year I had the whole thing put together, and John [Thompson] and Lefty [Driesell] couldn’t agree on what officials to use, and the whole thing fell apart. Every year it was something else.” Despite a 2 p.m. tip-off on the day after Thanksgiving and the hefty $29.50 ticket price necessitated by Potts’s financial guarantee, 13,761 fans showed up at USAir Arena in Landover for the renewal of the rivalry. “That was probably the only game on ESPN, so we had the whole nation watching that game,” Williams said. Coming off a 12-16 season, Maryland started a pair of freshmen in highly touted Keith Booth and relative unknown Joe Smith alongside three sophomores. Georgetown, led by the reigning Big East freshman of the year, center Othella Harrington, had failed to qualify for the NCAA tournament for the first time in 15 years despite winning 20 games. The Hoyas were heavy favorites, and while the contest was a home game for Georgetown, the crowd was decidedly pro-Maryland. “I remember looking in the stand during layup lines and just seeing so much red,” Simpkins said in a recent phone interview. Maryland started fast. Smith, who starred at Maury High in Norfolk, announced his presence on a first-half possession after receiving a pass in front of the Georgetown bench, where the 6-foot-10 Thompson stood, as always, with a towel draped over his shoulder. “Joe put the ball on the floor with his left hand and took one dribble and  ,” Williams recalled 30 years later. “John slowly turned and looked down the bench like, ‘Who the hell was that?’ Nobody knew who Joe was. They knew after that game, though.” Smith finished with 26 points, a record for a Maryland player in his debut, to go along with nine rebounds and three steals. Still, Georgetown led 38-28 at halftime and 51-37 with less than 13 minutes remaining. Thanks to its pressing defense, Maryland rallied and led by four late, but Georgetown guard George Butler, a junior-college transfer who scored 20 of his 21 points after halftime, sent the game into overtime with a three-pointer with 4.6 seconds to play. It was the Hoyas’ only field goal over the final eight minutes of regulation. Georgetown senior guard Joey Brown banked in an NBA-range three-pointer as the shot clock expired to give the Hoyas an 83-80 lead with a minute remaining in overtime. After Booth made two free throws to cut the deficit to one with 39 seconds left, Williams called a timeout and inserted seldom-used junior forward Kurtis Shultz. The only upperclassman in uniform for the Terps was put in the game to foul, but he came away with a steal of an errant pass by Kevin Millen. Out of a Maryland timeout with 13.7 seconds remaining, Simpkins dribbled slowly into the frontcourt before accelerating past Brown and into the lane. The former DeMatha Catholic star had been instructed to pass the ball if a Georgetown defender collapsed on him, but he instead flipped a shot over Reid, who had left Smith open beneath the basket. The ball fell straight through the net to give the Terps the lead, and when Georgetown failed to get a shot off at the other end, the Maryland bench erupted. “The Terps are back!” ESPN play-by-play man Dave Woloshin said as Maryland celebrated a rare win over a ranked team. “When I watch the replay now, as a coach, I look at myself driving, and I’m like, ‘The dude is wide open — just drop it off to him,’ ” Simpkins, who is in his  , said this week. “As a player, I didn’t predetermine I was going to shoot the ball. That offseason, I had worked a ton on my floaters because my freshman year I really struggled at the rim. I think it was almost muscle memory once I drove the ball that hard.” The Post reported that Maryland’s players “reacted almost as if they’d won a national championship.” Simpkins slapped hands with Maryland radio announcer Johnny Holliday before jumping onto the press table with his fists in the air as his teammates danced at midcourt. “I would have been very upset if we had lost that game,” Williams told reporters afterward. “But even if we had lost, I would have felt two days from now this was a great college basketball game. … This was one of those you remember for the rest of your life.” “If this is the highlight of our season,” Williams said after the win, “we won’t have a very good season.” Williams also gave the Terps’ fan base license to celebrate. “I want everyone associated with Maryland basketball to enjoy this day,” he said. “Don’t worry about anything else — yet.” Simpkins didn’t understand just how meaningful beating Georgetown was to people in the area until he arrived back at his dorm room to find the red light on his answering machine and 45 to 50 voice-mail messages waiting for him. Maryland had a home game against Cornell the next day, and Williams was understandably wary of a letdown. His team   en route to a 92-41 win. The Terps started the season 12-3, and in January they were ranked in the Associated Press top 25 for the first time since the second week of the 1985-86 campaign. They qualified for the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1988 and upset second-seeded Massachusetts in the second round before falling to Michigan in the Sweet 16. It was the first of 11 consecutive trips to the NCAA tournament under Williams, including the program’s first and only national title in 2002. The win over Georgetown made it all possible. “When you beat a ranked team, no matter who you had to play, at least you could go on the court and know you could compete if you played well, so that game helped us that year,” Williams, who still teases Simpkins about his decision to shoot the ball, said this week. “Duane’s shot was one of the biggest shots during my coaching career. That changed the world. We went from winning two regular season ACC games [in 1992-93] to the Sweet 16. … We were able to get the crowd back in Cole Field House. That game and that year meant a lot to Maryland basketball.” Simpkins grew up in Prince George’s County as a fan of both Georgetown and Maryland. He was enamored by the Hoyas’ physical style of play, but he wasn’t recruited by Georgetown because of the long-standing . During his four years in College Park, Simpkins took great pride in helping put Maryland back on the map. “As a coach, I know how hard it is to turn a program around,” said Simpkins, whose American squad   last Sunday. “… When you have a big win against a really big opponent, that can kind of be the jump-start to things to come. I love the fact that Juan Dixon, Steve Blake, Lonny Baxter and those guys won a national championship — they did a tremendous job. But I can honestly look back and say that I was a part of a team that helped make that happen.” After their 1993 classic, Maryland and Georgetown wouldn’t play again in the regular season until 2008. The Terps and Hoyas played a home-and-home series in 2015 and 2016, and the schools’ current coaches, Kevin Willard and Ed Cooley, have discussed resuming the rivalry as soon as next year.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/26/maryland-georgetown-basketball-rivalry-1993/,Washington Post,2023-11-26 05:00:00,
" is back in the NHL following shoulder surgery after signing a two-year contract with the Washington Capitals. General manager Brian MacLellan announced the long-expected deal with the defenseman Thursday, just over a week since Bear joined the Capitals for practice and they confirmed their intent to sign him.

General manager Brian MacLellan announced the long-expected deal with the defenseman Thursday, just over a week since Bear joined the Capitals for practice and they confirmed their intent to sign him. The contract is worth a pro-rated $4.125 million and carries a salary cap hit of $2.0625 million for the rest of this season and the 2024-25 season. “Being fully healthy now and putting the injury behind him, (he) could be a good fit for the organization,” coach Spencer Carbery said recently. “(He is) someone, I think, that can potentially, if all goes well, bring an added punch to our back end, especially offensively.” Bear, who was injured representing Canada at the world championships last spring, said he feels good and chose Washington in part because the team was not rushing him back into game action. It’s unclear when he might make his season debut. “Honestly felt like they really cared a lot and they want me here instead of needing me,” Bear said after joining the Capitals for their morning skate on Dec. 20. “I can kind of get my legs under me, get thinking quick again to learn the system and kind of get to learn everyone’s tendencies instead of just kind of getting tossed into the fire, so I really appreciate that.” The 26-year-old is joining his fourth NHL organization after starting with Edmonton and playing one-season stints with   and  . The Canucks did not tender Bear a restricted free agent offer last summer following the injury, relinquishing his rights and freeing him to sign with any team. He chose the Capitals, one of the league’s oldest teams, over several interested suitors. Washington is in the playoff mix in the Eastern Conference more than a third of the way through the season. “It’s a good group of guys,” Bear said. “(They) have a really good culture here where it’s a good mix. Everyone feels like they’re pulling their weight; everyone’s doing their job.” Bear gives the Capitals extra depth on the blue line with a right-handed shot who has averaged nearly 19 minutes a game throughout his career. Bear has 63 points in 259 regular-season and playoff games. “It just gives us, I feel like, a young player that’s still just scratching the surface,” Carbery said. The Capitals are also expected to soon get a boost up front with the season debut of winger Max Pacioretty, who is coming off   in January. They next play at the New York Islanders on Friday. ___ AP NHL: ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2023/12/28/capitals-ethan-bear/a047aef0-a5c4-11ee-aacb-6f873a65763e_story.html,Washington Post,2023-12-28 16:04:00,
"She asked her coach twice, she says, just to be sure. “You’re trading me because I’m pregnant?” It was January. Dearica Hamby had just come off a championship-winning and all-star 2022 season with the Las Vegas Aces, her first as a regular starter. She had a good relationship with her team and with her coach, former WNBA star Becky Hammon. She asked her coach twice, she says, just to be sure. “You’re trading me because I’m pregnant?” It was January. Dearica Hamby had just come off a championship-winning and all-star 2022 season with the Las Vegas Aces, her first as a regular starter. She had a good relationship with her team and with her coach, former WNBA star Becky Hammon. But that summer, Hamby had told Hammon she was pregnant. That’s when everything changed, Hamby said in an interview last week with The Washington Post and in a federal discrimination complaint she recently filed. The storied coach grilled her player about whether she had planned the pregnancy, Hamby said, and even remarked about Hamby’s use of birth control. According to Hamby, Hammon told her she wasn’t “holding up her end of the bargain” after signing a two-year contract extension that summer: “We didn’t expect you to get pregnant in the next two years,” Hamby says Hammon told her. So when the coach called Hamby early this year to tell her she was being traded away from Las Vegas, where she had twice won the league’s sixth player of the year award, Hamby says she asked Hammon explicitly if it was happening because of her pregnancy. Hammon’s response, Hamby says, made the situation clear: “What do you want me to do?” Earlier this month, Hamby took the extraordinary step of   with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Hammon, the Aces and the WNBA, taking aim at a league that has promoted itself as an engine of gender diversity, particularly when it comes to maternity benefits for its athletes. “I felt like the league didn’t do a good job of protecting me and protecting other players,” Hamby said. The EEOC has become a vehicle in recent years for athletes to attempt to force change from their employers and teams. The U.S. women’s national soccer team   in 2016 to allege its employer, the U.S. Soccer Federation, was paying female players less because of their gender; the commission later backed the team in a lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, filing a brief in support of the women. And last year,   a complaint that colleges were discriminating against Black athletes by limiting compensation. A spokesperson for the Aces did not respond to requests for comment. Hammon has  , saying Hamby had been traded because of “math and business,” not her pregnancy. The coach said she “handled Dearica with care from Day 1 when she told me” that she was pregnant. When the WNBA suspended Hammon, the Aces were critical of the league’s investigation and said they stood behind their coach. In a statement this month, a WNBA spokesperson told The Post that the league conducted “a thorough investigation of the allegations and levied appropriate discipline based on its findings.” In her complaint, Hamby argues that after she presented the WNBA with a clear-cut case of pregnancy discrimination, the league responded “inadequately” — handing down just a two-game suspension for Hammon for violating “respect in the workplace” policies. “It was a slap on the wrist for the things that happened to me,” Hamby said. The WNBA’s characterization of the issue as one of workplace “respect,” she said, obscures the more serious truth: that Hammon and the Aces traded her to the Los Angeles Sparks because she was pregnant, a move she claims followed months of mistreatment. Other prominent female athletes have spoken up about pregnancy discrimination. A group of prominent runners including Allyson Felix alleged that Nike cut their pay and bonuses when they were pregnant, a practice  . Federal anti-discrimination and disability laws forbid employers not just from firing employees because of pregnancy or potential pregnancy but also from changing other terms and conditions of employment, such as job assignments. Hamby and her attorneys argue that by trading her to the Sparks, the Aces violated the law — which also forbids “harassing” an employee because of pregnancy. “A player can be traded or transferred for any reason or no reason at all,” said Dana Sniegocki, one of Hamby’s attorneys. “Except for a particular, specified class of reasons, and pregnancy is one of those.” The reality of the trade, and its motivations, could be complex. Hamby’s trade was   for the Sparks when it was announced in January, but the Aces’ motivations were also financial: The team needed to clear salary cap room for two-time MVP Candace Parker, whom it later signed. The Aces sent Hamby and their 2024 first-round draft pick in exchange for Amanda Zahui B. and a second-round pick; they eventually   for multiple second-round picks. Hamby   by the Aces shortly after the trade, writing on Instagram that she was “discriminated against” in her trade to the Sparks and calling their treatment of her “unethical and unprofessional.” She calls the choice to post about her experiences, sparking the WNBA’s investigation, a “turning point in my life.” “It’s not the kind of person I am — I don’t like conflict, I don’t like confrontation, I’ve always taken less in order to be a part of something bigger,” Hamby told The Post. She spent the week before she spoke publicly “shaking and crying” and even throwing up from anxiety, she said. But that changed the moment she published her statement. “As soon as I did it, the anxiety left my body. It felt like it’s bigger than me.” The league and her former team’s reaction to her initial public allegations, Hamby said, has been as painful as anything that came before it. After the suspension, Hammon continued to deny the allegations,   that any allegations of wrongdoing were “adamantly false and not true from any person in this organization.” “This is why people don’t speak up — because they’re never believed,” Hamby said. “In that moment I really just wanted an apology, and it still to this day hasn’t happened. It’s just been denial.” The trade, Hamby said, has also had painful consequences for her 6-year-old daughter, who grew up alongside Aces players and staff and had become a fixture on the sidelines of games. She knows some of why Hamby believes she was traded, Hamby said. “But I haven’t been able to explain to her why she can’t go play with certain staff members’ kids now, why she can’t go to such-and-such’s house. It’s heartbreaking for her.” When her daughter asked to go to an Aces game with friends this year, Hamby agreed, but said she cried as she watched her daughter walk in with her friends. “This is home for her,” Hamby said. When the videoboard, which always used to linger on her dancing daughter, cut away this time and panned to the crowd, Hamby said alarm bells went off. She said she reached out to an Aces staff member who said they had been told not to show her daughter on the videoboard. “That felt personal,” Hamby said. Hamby still wants an apology first and foremost, she said, as well as an acknowledgment of what happened from the league, which didn’t release specific findings from the investigation. But she is also calling for significant change to the WNBA’s handling of players’ pregnancy and maternity. In 2020, a   between players and the league was widely praised for offering maternity leave for players at their full salaries and stipends for child care. But there are still many gaps remaining, Hamby says, and pregnancy can put teams “in a tough situation.” She wants the league to adjust rules around the salary cap that make it difficult to replace highly paid players when they are pregnant. The Aces, Hamby alleges in her complaint, asserted that by signing a two-year contract extension, she had effectively given up the right to become pregnant. “Players shouldn’t be afraid to start families,” she said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/15/dearica-hamby-pregnant-aces-trade/,Washington Post,2023-10-15 09:00:00,

"I’ve become something of an expert at knowing when Hugh Freeze is lying, which is often. He wasn’t this week. Auburn’s coach was genuinely flummoxed about college football’s crowded and nearly unworkable calendar, specifically when it comes to recruiting and the transfer portal. “That’s been one of my issues,”  . “… When I say that I don’t think I’ve been very good at some of this portal deal, [it] is because I’m really committed to trying to sign the best high school class we can.” I’ve become something of an expert at knowing when Hugh Freeze is lying, which is often. He wasn’t this week. Auburn’s coach was genuinely flummoxed about college football’s crowded and nearly unworkable calendar, specifically when it comes to recruiting and the transfer portal. “That’s been one of my issues,”  . “… When I say that I don’t think I’ve been very good at some of this portal deal, [it] is because I’m really committed to trying to sign the best high school class we can.” As of this writing, Freeze is closing in on a top-10   after one full calendar year at Auburn, but the Tigers are basically absent  . Because of the indecipherable, ungoverned structure of college football, high school players are committing to programs during the early signing window this week, at the same time   are committing to new schools, at the same time as bowl game practices and preparation for the College Football Playoff, all on the heels of the   just a few weeks back. If that seems like poor planning on the part of college football’s leadership, it’s because there is no leadership. For years we’ve seen slow-creeping change become a bull rush, from name, image and likeness (NIL) expansion to   to television-induced   to playoff expansion pains and even, finally,  . The ensuing confusion and a future without a firm blueprint for on-field success could have created a sea change for coaching hires in recent years. With the old rules and best practices fading fast, innovative thinking could have brought new, dynamic hires with ideas about how to succeed in post-portal roster management and realignment. But we aren’t there yet — not by a long shot. Instead, retreads such as Freeze are left trying to conceive best practices in a world where their calling card for success — and the reason their checkered pasts are ignored — might not hold nearly as much weight in the future. Freeze “resigned” from Mississippi in 2017, technically for using a school-issued phone for “inappropriate contact” with recruits, which is the college scandal version of Al Capone going to prison for tax fraud.   and dealt with him and his hapless superiors directly during the reporting. Weirdly enough, Auburn Athletic Director John Cohen — the man who hired Freeze last year — was serving the same role at Mississippi State when the school turned in complaints to the NCAA about alleged rule-breaking and deception within Freeze’s program. Of course, that didn’t matter five years later at Auburn, because the Tigers’ previous coach, Bryan Harsin, failed to recruit high school players at an elite level. High school recruiting used to be the sole off-the-field gold standard for a quality coaching hire. It’s why Auburn hired Freeze in 2022. (He also had beaten Alabama Coach Nick Saban twice, so that’s gospel on The Plains.) Freeze was, by my estimation, a pathological liar willing to stack shoddily crafted deceptions to maintain his run in the SEC, all at the expense of others. To date, I’ve seen zero evidence he has changed as a human being. But, man, he can sign a   high school recruiting class and command a strong offense. By the standards of 2014, Freeze checks all the boxes. But across the industry, coaches and their employers are privately admitting they don’t even know what the right boxes are for 2024 and beyond. Maybe that’s why Freeze felt like a good hire last year. Maybe that’s why Arkansas rehired as its offensive coordinator former head coach Bobby Petrino, the man it fired over a decade ago for orchestrating an affair with a subordinate, a former-volleyball-player-turned-university-employee he lied to his bosses about after a motorcycle wreck. (If you’re new to this sport or only casually invested, please understand that sentence is factually accurate and even weirder than you think.) Since then, he was fired from Louisville and turned in a lackluster 2023 season as Texas A&M’s play caller. Petrino is a far cry from the offensive genius status he enjoyed in his original Arkansas heyday, but the Hogs still hired him. Why? Because he was good once? I don’t know. I do know college football will only innovate, create or progress when forced to. The massive difference between those two situations isn’t in the particulars of the scandals preceding these desperate second-chance hires; it’s the positions. Petrino will call plays. Freeze is expected to steward a program trying to keep some kind of pace with Alabama and Georgia, its two hated, dynastic rivals. High school signing classes are still paramount to success — every recent national champion built its run on a blueprint of elite high school talent developed in a traditional arc of a four-year collegiate system, give or take redshirts or a few transfers. But this ungovernable game ruled territorially by television networks and conference commissioners is changing quickly. It’s impossible to say whether you can win at the level Auburn boosters are expecting without accounting for players leaving at the end of every season. Texas A&M is a great case study. In February 2022, the Aggies landed seven five-star recruits and completed the highest-rated signing class in history,   score. Less than two years later, a third of that class is gone, with the best players (wide receiver Evan Stewart and defensive lineman Walter Nolen) among them. So is Florida State. The Seminoles’ almost-playoff-caliber season started with high-profile transfers helping them beat LSU. The idea of Florida State leaning on the portal in a state historically overripe with high school talent seemed anathema just a year or two ago, but Coach Mike Norvell found a way to create complementary systems and resurrect the Seminoles to national prominence,  . Freeze could, can and will recruit strong classes of high school players. His classification as an “offensive guru,” is, like Petrino’s, subject to interpretation and holds a short shelf life in the ever-evolving world of schematics. But his unfamiliarity with and lack of credentials in the portal game are growing into legitimate concerns, and he’s not alone. No one, not even overactive portal coaches such as Mississippi’s Lane Kiffin and Colorado’s Deion Sanders, can claim they have mastered the new apparatus, though many are willing to learn on the job. But for someone such as Freeze, a reality is dawning. He needs to keep his status as an expert in personnel, because he has never achieved anything close to the on-field consistency of a title-caliber coach. His Mississippi teams would routinely lose to lesser opponents the same year they would slay a giant such as Alabama. Auburn has already felt this, having dropped a home game to New Mexico State a week before almost upsetting Saban’s playoff-bound Crimson Tide. One of the unspoken understandings of big-time college football, especially in the SEC, is that we’re expected to look away from coaches’ obvious moral and ethical failings in favor of their supposed rarefied skill set, something that makes ignoring their past (or current) sins a palatable trade. It’s why Kiffin, with a chance to deliver Freeze’s old school its first 11-win season in history, seems Teflon-inured to media criticism at the moment: He’s not a fundamentally better person; he’s just winning. Auburn, like every other school in its neighborhood, is more than willing to turn blind eyes — as long as they’re in the direction of a winning football team. Freeze and his ilk have a short time to master a brave new world.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/20/college-football-coaches-scandal/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 21:50:00,
"Disappointment became something of an epidemic for prominent major league franchises in 2023, so the St. Louis Cardinals, who had not endured a losing season in 15 years, were not alone in entering this offseason spurred by unfamiliar desperation. But as the first month of the offseason turns into the second, the Cardinals have differentiated themselves from similar disappointed powerhouses  in a few significant ways. One, they have been clear about what they want. Two, they have been aggressive in trying to get it. Disappointment became something of an epidemic for prominent major league franchises in 2023, so the St. Louis Cardinals, who had not endured a losing season in 15 years, were not alone in entering this offseason spurred by unfamiliar desperation. But as the first month of the offseason turns into the second, the Cardinals have differentiated themselves from similar disappointed powerhouses  in a few significant ways. One, they have been clear about what they want. Two, they have been aggressive in trying to get it. “We entered this offseason with one simple goal, and that was pitching, pitching, pitching,” Cardinals team president John Mozeliak said this week at a news conference introducing Sonny Gray, the most decorated of three starting pitchers St. Louis recently signed. “So far, so good.” They say titles are not won in November … at least when the World Series ends in October. Specifics aside, the offseason does not necessarily determine much of anything when it comes to the regular season. None of this might change St. Louis’s 2024 fate at all. But the Cardinals were already taking a different approach to their disappointment as early as August, when other teams were still grappling with what went wrong. Even as they were playing out the last days of the most disappointing regular season of his tenure, Mozeliak and his manager, Oli Marmol, were open about what they felt had gone wrong: Their starting pitching was not good enough to carry them to a division title, let alone deep into October. They thought a rotation full of pitchers who induced weak contact would play well with their elite defense and get enough swings and misses to survive. It didn’t. Their starters finished with  , and three of them have departed: The Cardinals sent Jack Flaherty, once seen as a future St. Louis ace, to  ; dealt reliable left-hander Jordan Montgomery  ; and saw Adam Wainwright retire. So the Cardinals entered this offseason desperate for starters and everyone around the sport knew it, which meant they had little leverage in potential trade negotiations and little room to hide from agents who might want to drive their clients’ prices up. Plus, the free agent market for starting pitchers is sparse enough that multiple heads of baseball operations called it one of the more competitive they have ever seen. Executives and agents alike assume top options such as   and   will earn nine-figure deals despite Snell’s propensity to walk batters and Yamamoto’s lack of a track record in MLB. Everyone needed innings, and many of the sport’s biggest spenders have been chasing them. Faced with those circumstances, the Cardinals jumped. They signed two veterans with a history of eating innings, Lance Lynn and Kyle Gibson, to one-year deals with club options for 2025. Neither came close to contending for a Cy Young Award last year. Lynn gave up so many home runs that it became something of an uncomfortable joke, one even the sometimes surly veteran made fun of himself. But since 2013, Gibson is  . Everyone ahead of Gibson is a future Hall of Famer, Cy Young Award winner or both. At this point in their careers, neither Lynn nor Gibson is an ace, though each was an all-star as recently as 2021. But neither Lynn nor Gibson is a risk, either. “We were hoping to be able to sign a couple pitchers we knew we could count on innings for, then if we were able to accomplish that, we were hoping to do something a little bit bigger, longer,” Mozeliak said. “And obviously that’s where Sonny fits in.” Gray, 34, finished   after pitching to a 2.79 ERA in 32 starts for the Minnesota Twins. He is a three-time all-star with a similar history of durability to Gibson and Lynn, sitting 14th on that list of innings thrown since 2013. The Cardinals signed him to a three-year deal, meaning he can anchor their rotation for the foreseeable future, and anchors — rather than headliners — seem to be what Mozeliak and Co. wanted to make sure they got this offseason above all else. “You want to talk about changing a pitching culture or creating and establishing a strong pitching culture, I think bringing in Lance, bringing in Kyle, bringing in me — you want to talk about bringing an edge?” Gray said at his news conference. “Bringing an intent and some fire to the guys taking the ball? You’re definitely doing that.” But while Gray pitched like an ace last year, he hasn’t always profiled as an elite starter. If Snell and Yamamoto were the top names on the market, Gray was a tier below them, a little less coveted because of his age, a little less heralded because he has never won a Cy Young or even been the clear-cut ace of his team’s staff. Pairing him, Gibson and Lynn with fellow veteran Miles Mikolas means the Cardinals will start the season with a far steadier, more predictable bunch than they had last season. But it does not necessarily mean they are ready to reemerge as the de facto favorites in the National League Central, let alone a World Series contender. They do not have a clear fifth starter. They do not, one could argue, have the kind of ace around which championship teams tend to be built — though the Rangers were without their aces for most of this year’s postseason and survived because they stockpiled pitching depth. “There’s still two months left in this offseason. We understand there’s still work to do. The offseason is fluid. We’re going to take our time, reassess where we are,” Mozeliak said. “We’ll certainly see if there are ways we can still improve before we get down to Jupiter.” Jupiter, the Florida town where the Cardinals spend spring training, is still three months away. But as they head to Nashville for the winter meetings next week, the Cardinals are largely ahead of their competition. Most of their fellow contenders are still assessing their options for this offseason, desperate to get some help — of some kind. The Cardinals, having filled their most glaring void, are already onto reassessing — and are no longer quite as desperate to scoop out answers from a dwindling free agent pitching pool.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/30/cardinals-mlb-offseason-moves/,Washington Post,2023-11-30 09:27:00,
"Maryland’s state fish is again imperiled.

The stock of young striped bass has been troublingly low since 2019, according to  , making this the worst stretch in the species’s history since its population collapsed in the 1980s.

In the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, invasive predators, warming waters and overfishing have threatened the immensely popular striped bass, known locally as rockfish. The stock of young striped bass has been troublingly low since 2019, according to  , making this the worst stretch in the species’s history since its population collapsed in the 1980s. This year, a key indicator of breeding success sank to its second-lowest level ever. To reverse that trend and bolster striped bass populations across the Atlantic coast, Maryland is deploying emergency rules shortening the 2024 fishing window to protect the weeks during and after spawning season. “Maryland waters serve as the spawning grounds for many of the striped bass that migrate up and down the East Coast, and we take our leadership role in managing the overall population seriously,” Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said in a statement Wednesday. State officials and an interstate commission overseeing the fishing industry constantly assess fish populations and periodically set new rules for anglers that aim to balance protecting wildlife with the interests of commercial and recreational fishermen. Maryland’s emergency regulations, which seek to correct for likely overfishing since the early 2000s, were met with approval from conservationists, though some believe the temporary restrictions do not go far enough. The rules eliminate the state’s striped bass trophy season in early May and shut down the catch-and-keep fishery on the Susquehanna Flats from May 16 to May 31. Striped bass typically spawn in the Chesapeake Bay in late spring — though in recent years the fish have spawned as early as March because of warm weather. Those temporary emergency measures last for about six months, and the Department of Natural Resources will have to go through the rulemaking process to implement similar restrictions in 2025 and beyond. The silver fish with black stripes down its body has long been prized as a sport fish and for its flaky white filets. The striped bass is important to recreational fishermen, charter boat operators who take recreational fishers in search of a catch and commercial fishermen who collectively harvest millions of fish across the East Coast each year,  . But the fish faces many threats in Maryland waters. Warmer winters have interfered with the water quality in the fish’s spawning grounds, hampering their reproductive success, officials say. Increasing numbers of invasive predators such as the blue catfish have been eating juveniles. And while most bass survive the catch-and-release method fishermen use on millions each year, many succumb to injuries suffered in their battle against the line. A metric of reproductive success for the fish, the “young-of-the-year” index, has fallen from the long-term average of 11.1 to 1.0 in 2023, according to state data. Maryland officials hope the temporary pause in fishing, coupled with projections of a colder winter, will lift the 2024 index. “We need the colder winter,” said Michael Luisi, associate director for tidal and coastal management and science for the Department of Natural Resources. “We need a snowmelt in the spring that produces the right water quality and conditions in the bay.” Conservationists welcomed the new rules, but some said more should be done to safeguard the fish population. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a nonprofit that advocates protecting the bay, called for more conservation — highlighting measures coming before the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission early next year. “While this action is an important step,” the foundation’s executive director, Allison Colden, said in a statement, “further changes to protect striped bass, including those currently under consideration at ASMFC, will likely be necessary to help rebuild the population.” The commission, which considers interstate regulations to protect striped bass across the East Coast, is proposing   for striped bass that could change the rules for both recreational and commercial fishermen. The proposed changes include changing commercial fishing quotas, further limiting how many fish recreational anglers can keep, and changing the size of legally harvested fish to protect younger rockfish. The commission is   on the proposals over the next two weeks, including one on Dec. 6 in Annapolis. The Maryland Charter Boat Association did not return a request for comment on Maryland’s emergency regulations or the additional proposed changes that could affect its industry. Stripers Forever, a group of conservationists focused on protecting rockfish, have been   on harvesting to restore population numbers. But Maryland officials, who have the most direct control over the fish’s spawning grounds in the Chesapeake Bay, have said more nuanced approaches that take into account the needs of commercial and recreational fishermen as well as the fish can help bring population numbers back up. Maryland has banned fishing for striped bass before. In the 1980s, the  population declined so severely that state regulators instated a five-year moratorium. But Luisi said the situation today is not as dire as it was in the ’80s. The spawning stock biomass then was far lower than it is today, he said. But the population of striped bass that peaked in the early 2000s has been slowly declining ever since, most likely because of overfishing, Luisi added. But regulators didn’t realize too many fish were being harvested until more data became available. “As science changes, we sometimes get information that tells us maybe we weren’t as conservative as we should have been,” he said. He encouraged members of the public, especially those invested in fishing for striped bass for many years to come, to  at the upcoming public hearing. “We don’t want the public to think this [emergency regulation] is it,” Luisi said. “There are going to be additional rule changes for 2024, and possibly 2025.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/02/rockfish-population-shrinks-md-shortens-fishing-season/,Washington Post,2023-12-02 06:00:00,

"Charlotte Hornets forward Miles Bridges was denied entry to Canada on Sunday, per multiple  , as a result of his legal issues. Before a game in Toronto on Monday against the Raptors, Hornets Coach Steve Clifford confirmed to reporters that Bridges was not with the team. Clifford declined to engage in specifics about Bridges’s absence. Charlotte Hornets forward Miles Bridges was denied entry to Canada on Sunday, per multiple  , as a result of his legal issues. Before a game in Toronto on Monday against the Raptors, Hornets Coach Steve Clifford confirmed to reporters that Bridges was not with the team. Clifford declined to engage in specifics about Bridges’s absence. The Hornets attempted to get Canadian authorities to reverse their decision, per reports. A spokesman for the team did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment. Bridges, 25, began the season by sitting out the final 10 games of a 30-game suspension the NBA gave him in April, following an agreement he reached in November with the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office in which he   to one felony count of injuring a child’s parent. The agreement, which allowed Bridges to avoid jail time, called for three years of probation plus 52 weeks of parenting classes, 52 weeks of domestic violence counseling and 100 hours of community service. Bridges had been accused of assaulting the mother of his two children, Mychelle Johnson, in front of them. Johnson had shared photos of her injuries and a medical report listing a concussion and a broken nose. He initially   in July 2022 to three felony counts. In October, Bridges turned himself in to police in North Carolina’s Lincoln County after an arrest warrant had been issued in January alleging he violated a domestic violence protection order. Bridges was issued a separate criminal summons, per  , that alleged he threatened Johnson during a custody exchange. According to  , his hearing in that case was pushed back from November to February. Drafted 12th in 2018 out of Michigan State, Bridges improved steadily over his first four seasons and was positioned in 2022 for a huge contract in free agency when he was first arrested. He ended up sitting out all of the 2022-23 season as his legal situation played out, then re-signed with the Hornets in July on a one-year, $7.9 million deal. The absence Monday of Bridges, who had started Charlotte’s previous 12 games, left the team’s lineup further depleted in Toronto. Two starters, guard LaMelo Ball (ankle) and center Mark Williams (back), were already out with injuries, and a third, forward Gordon Hayward, was ruled out shortly before the game with a stomach virus.

"SHURA MILITARY BASE, Israel — Mordechai Porat leaves his home each morning in a crisp black suit and hat. It isn’t until he arrives at this army base in central Israel that he changes into his green military fatigues. Porat, an ultra-Orthodox Jew, doesn’t want his family or neighbors in Bnei Brak spotting him in uniform and discovering his secret: He has enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces. SHURA MILITARY BASE, Israel — Mordechai Porat leaves his home each morning in a crisp black suit and hat. It isn’t until he arrives at this army base in central Israel that he changes into his green military fatigues. Porat, an ultra-Orthodox Jew, doesn’t want his family or neighbors in Bnei Brak spotting him in uniform and discovering his secret: He has enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces. The 36-year-old social worker is one of a growing number of ultra-Orthodox Jews, or Haredim, who have responded to the   attack of Oct. 7 by enlisting in Israel’s campaign to eradicate the militant group, sometimes quietly, despite the community’s exemption from military service. Since that surprise attack, when Hamas and allied fighters streamed out of Gaza, killing around 1,200 people and taking 240 more hostage, volunteers from all walks of Israeli life have sought to join the war effort. But the 2,000 new Haredi applicants stand out. Their exemption from mandatory conscription has   in a country where military service is an integral part of the national identity. It led to the downfall of the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2019, the start of a four-year election crisis. The Haredim have adamantly opposed being made to serve, on the grounds that they should be spending all available time studying the Torah. They worry that young Haredim sent to the army may never return to their religious duties. Their size and clout have led Israeli leaders to cater to their demands. They’ve also been excused from observing national education standards and paying some taxes. The rush now to enlist, while still taboo among some Haredim, is showing how the Hamas attack and Israel’s war, in which its forces have killed 21,320 and injured 55,603 people in Gaza, are reshaping, even drawing together, disparate segments of this divided country, including along some of its deepest fault lines. “We have the Haredi community legitimizing the army, the Haredi community lowering their stigma to boys that are enlisting,” said Nechumi Yaffe, a lecturer in the School of Social and Policy Studies at Tel Aviv University. “We have the Haredi community saying yes, it is very important to have an army and I would be more willing to draft myself.” Yaffe polled Haredim on their attitudes about the military in March 2022 and again after Oct. 7. In 2022, 35 percent strongly agreed that they should contribute to Israel’s defense. After the attacks, that rose to 49 percent. After Oct. 7, the IDF tasked a Haredi rabbi to recruit from the community. Rami Ravad, 65, had served in the Israeli air force. He put out a call on WhatsApp. Within hours, he said, more than 400 people had responded. Soon more than 1,000 were eager to sign up. Messaging was crucial, Ravad said. He assured candidates who were still in yeshiva, or religious school, that they would not have to drop out. “The Haredi ideology is not against the idea of the army,” he said. The Torah includes accounts of soldiers and war. “But you can’t force them.” Of the 2,000 Haredi applicants since Oct. 7, the IDF says, 450 have been accepted. That’s a small fraction of the military, which has an estimated 170,000 active-duty personnel. But it’s a huge shift for the community, Yaffe said. Now, she said, “there’s going to be a lot of pressure to change” the general exemption law. The Haredim were perhaps never more separate from Israeli society than on Oct. 7. It was the Jewish Sabbath and also the joyous holiday of Simchat Torah. Members of the community woke up to more rocket sirens than usual, but because they refrain on Shabbat from using electricity, they had no way of knowing the cause. “I didn’t know that as I was dancing, others were crying,” Porat said. He wanted to help. As a social worker, he believed, he could support soldiers. His wife told him he was crazy. Enlisting, she predicted, would harm the family’s standing in the community. Porat signed up in mid-October. He completed two weeks of military training and was assigned to provide psychological counseling to soldiers who handle the bodies of the dead. Despite his efforts to hide his new job, word has started to circulate in his community. His son was rejected from two religious schools without explanation. “I knew there would be harsh consequences I had to consider,” Porat said. Still, he said, “it was worth it.” During training, the enlistees learn to wield a weapon, complete obstacle courses and become familiar with their officers, many of whom are a decade younger. Graduates have been assigned to be drivers, cooks and guards. Some have been tasked with preparing corpses for burial, a sacred practice embedded in Jewish law. When Benzi Schwartz enlisted, relatives emailed him sermons to voice their disapproval. Schwartz, who is almost 40, isn’t trained to serve in combat, but he wishes he could. The Israeli campaign has destroyed much of Gaza. More than 1.8 million Gazans   their homes. They’re suffering shortages of water, food and shelter, sharply limited health care, and cuts to power and communications. International aid organizations warn of rising starvation. Schwartz said he wholeheartedly supports the war effort. “I have no sympathy for the Gazans who woke up on Oct. 7 and walked, some of them on their crutches, to kill, rape and torture Jews,” he said. “In any religion, there’s a clear principle: ‘He who comes to kill you, rise up early to kill him.’” Others see more nuance but say it’s ultimately a matter of survival. Nathan Rakov, a British citizen who has lived in Israel most of his life, has been accepted into the military and is waiting to be assigned a role. “Anyone innocent who dies is a painful and unfair thing,” he said. “On the other hand, the value of preserving my life, that of my children and that of my brothers and sisters is also high — as a human being, as a Jew and as a religious man.” Rakov said the aftermath of Oct. 7 has made him feel as patriotic as he feels religious. “Do I feel more Israeli now?” he asked. “The answer is yes.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/28/ultra-orthodox-israel-defense-forces/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 15:20:00,
"House GOP leadership postponed a vote on a major federal appropriations bill Thursday after a group of moderate Republicans objected to a D.C.  -related restriction contained in the hulking package. Eight Republicans raised concerns with a provision that would have blocked D.C. from enforcing a 2014 law prohibiting discrimination based on reproductive health choices — a large enough bloc to make a difference due to Republicans’ slim margin, especially given some absences. House GOP leadership postponed a vote on a major federal appropriations bill Thursday after a group of moderate Republicans objected to a D.C.  -related restriction contained in the hulking package. Eight Republicans raised concerns with a provision that would have blocked D.C. from enforcing a 2014 law prohibiting discrimination based on reproductive health choices — a large enough bloc to make a difference due to Republicans’ slim margin, especially given some absences. Their pushback surprised D.C. officials, who are not used to seeing Republicans defend the deep-blue city, and it was enough to threaten the entire financial services appropriations bill, which included about a dozen other policy restrictions on the District. City officials were bracing for a whole barrage of budget riders to sail through on Thursday, including allowing people with out-of-state weapons permits to carry guns in D.C. and banning the city from using automated traffic cameras, a measure that could deal a serious blow to D.C.'s finances. Yet some moderates drew the line on the attempt to block the city’s Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act, especially as abortion has made the GOP increasingly vulnerable in critical swing districts and states, with Tuesday’s elections offering more evidence. Rep. John S. Duarte (R-Calif.), among the Republicans to object to the D.C. rider, told reporters that the group of moderates wanted to see the provision stripped from the bill and offered as a separate amendment. He described it as “completely unrelated” to the funding package and questioned why anyone would want to allow discrimination against people who may have had abortions. “The moderates are standing our ground,” Duarte said. “A lot of us in swing districts — and a lot of us that want to be very respectful of where the American people are and aren’t on these social issues — are standing our ground and setting some limits as to what can get jammed into these bills.” Rep. Marcus J. Molinaro (R-N.Y.) said that for the House and Senate to reach an appropriations bill they both agree on, he believed this provision could not be part of it. The appropriations bill, for financial services and general government, includes funding for the District. “The city of Washington, D.C., has established a nondiscrimination provision. It is both their right to do so within the city — but it is also not something the House should seek to eliminate and undermine those protections,” Molinaro said in an interview Thursday morning. Separately, complicating the vote further, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and other House Freedom Caucus members were   that their party  ’s  to block funding   and some were prepared to vote against the appropriations bill, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Council member Christina Henderson (I-At Large), who drafted the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act while a council staffer in 2014, said the moderate group’s stand against the D.C. rider was “a welcome gift” she was not expecting. “I was confused,” she said, describing her reaction when reading initial news reports Thursday morning. “Usually, for Republicans, there aren’t enough restrictions. ... I do wonder if it has something to do with Tuesday’s elections and whether they’re concerned about their fates in their own districts. But I appreciate it — I don’t want to minimize what this means for residents in the District to finally have not just Democrats but other members of Congress standing up and saying, ‘This is ridiculous.’” Congress has oversight of D.C. thanks to a provision in the Constitution — and Republicans have leveraged that authority with unprecedented success this year, including  . House Republicans have long taken aim at this D.C. nondiscrimination law involving reproductive rights, which they   and have tried to torpedo in budget riders before. Even in 2015, a group of moderate Republicans did not support their party’s attempt to block the law. But since the  , moderate Republicans in Congress have grown increasingly vocal against GOP attempts to enact more abortion restrictions as consequences have mounted at the polls. Similar to Thursday’s action, in September, some moderates voted against an agriculture appropriations bill over a provision to ban delivery of abortion pills by mail, ultimately helping to tank the bill. House Republican moderates have   to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) since his election to the post two weeks ago that he should not make them take votes on abortion-related issues and that, if he did, they would be willing to sink the measures for the sake of their districts. Tuesday’s elections only amplified their concerns, as voters in Ohio enshrined abortion protections in the state constitution and Virginia Democrats flipped the House and won control of the General Assembly, crippling Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s pursuit of a 15-week abortion ban with some exceptions. Also this week, a  to target five New York Republicans ahead of the 2024 elections, in part on the issue of abortion. Some of those Republicans, including Molinaro and Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, brought concerns against the D.C. abortion-related rider. “The American people want every level of government to more appropriately respect the difficult choices women have to make,” Molinaro told reporters Wednesday. “These are difficult choices, and politicizing them is not helpful.” This specific rider is not in the Senate version of the appropriations bill. And   has already said that he would veto the financial services appropriations bill, which also includes funding for scores of government agencies, if it reached his desk. Among the reasons, the White House pointed to the plethora of restrictions House Republicans wanted to put on D.C. that would “undermine the principle of home rule for the Nation’s capital.” The statement specifically pointed to Republicans’ attempt to block enforcement of D.C.'s reproductive health anti-discrimination law. House Republican leadership had anticipated passing the funding bill Thursday since roughly a dozen Democrats would be absent, allowing moderate Republicans to object but not sink it. But four Republicans did not show up for votes, immediately complicating its passage. The financial services appropriations bill was the second funding proposal that Johnson had to pull from floor consideration this week due to deep intraparty disagreements. He had to delay consideration of the transportation and housing funding bill because of concerns primarily from New York Republicans about the deep cut in spending for the Amtrak train system. Failure to pass all 12 bills that fund the government for the full fiscal year will greatly irritate the far-right flank of the GOP conference, even though it, too, has been deeply entrenched in making sure its own spending demands are met throughout the process. “What I felt that we were going to do is we were going to do everything we can to get these appropriation bills through the house before the deadline,” said Rep. Troy E. Nehls (R-Tex.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus. “You get all these individual members that say, ‘I don’t like that. … If I don’t get what I want, I’m going to take my sack lunch and I’m going home.’ I think that’s what we’re seeing play out here.” The immediate impact on the financial services appropriations bill is unclear, and it could come back up for a vote at a later date. Officials in the D.C. mayor’s office, still assessing what the development could change for the city’s outlook, did not want to speak too soon about expectations. Reacting to the failed vote, Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said of Republicans, “They’ve got enough to do without trying to worry about what the District of Columbia is doing.” The city has for years protested “legacy riders,” which were part of Thursday’s package, as well. Those riders prohibit the city from creating a legal marketplace for marijuana, even though it’s legal to possess in D.C., and also prohibit D.C. from spending local funds on subsidizing abortion. Moderate Republicans did not raise any issue with that provision. Additional traffic-related restrictions would halt D.C.'s prohibitions on turning right on red at many intersections  and ban the city from using automated traffic-enforcement cameras, which is of serious concern to D.C. officials considering their sizable impact on the city’s finances. That provision alone could create a $1 billion hole in the city’s budget over the next four years, something Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) warned congressional leadership about this summer in a letter pleading for the provision to be removed. One rider would also prohibit the city from spending local funds to carry out the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act, the city’s major policing legislation that only just survived Congress’s vote to block it this year after Biden intervened to veto that action. The impact of that rider is unclear, given that many provisions in the policing bill don’t necessarily require funds, such as restricting certain policing tactics. Bowser has  asking the council to adjust some provisions she said went “too far,” such as language surrounding a prohibition on neck restraints. Other restrictions in the funding bill would repeal the Death with Dignity Act, a 2016 measure permitting physicians to help terminally ill patients die, and would divert funds for  . On Wednesday, Republicans also succeeded in adding a pair of riders prohibiting the city from requiring   vaccinations for public school students or the public at large. The D.C. Council had   the coronavirus vaccine requirement for students in a vote Tuesday. “If you want to legislate on local D.C. matters, become a D.C. resident and get elected mayor or council member,” Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said on the House floor during debate Wednesday.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/09/congress-republican-moderates-dc-abortion-rider/,Washington Post,2023-11-09 14:46:00,
"It was a gamble in its own right for Kenneth Huber to try to mount a 165-inch TV in his basement office. It’s actually a three-by-three grid of 55-inch 4K computer monitors, and the first time Huber tried to install them on a $1,500 stand in his suburban Philadelphia home, all nine of the heavy screens cracked. Fortunately, the retailer sent him replacements, and this time he hedged his bet by supplementing the stand with large spacer brackets. It was a gamble in its own right for Kenneth Huber to try to mount a 165-inch TV in his basement office. It’s actually a three-by-three grid of 55-inch 4K computer monitors, and the first time Huber tried to install them on a $1,500 stand in his suburban Philadelphia home, all nine of the heavy screens cracked. Fortunately, the retailer sent him replacements, and this time he hedged his bet by supplementing the stand with large spacer brackets. Huber works with betting advice company inplayLIVE and wagers on the NFL, NBA, NHL and college basketball. His desk is about six feet from this wall of screens, on which he can view games in any number of configurations: one game across all of them, one game on top and three across the bottom or as many as 36 games, with four on each monitor. A tricked-out office with multiple television and computer screens won’t make a sports gambler sharp, just as owning a $3,000 set of clubs doesn’t make a scratch golfer. But pro bettors, always seeking an edge, sometimes invest in personal setups so elaborate they rival TV control rooms. Several such bettors gave The Washington Post a peek via Zoom at their in-home command centers. The gear isn’t cheap, but when you bet for a living, it is tax deductible. A specialist in live betting during games — bets on the next play, drive or score of games that have already started — Huber depends on following the action with as little delay as possible. All nine screens on his monitor grid have hard-wired connections, and next to the grid is a curved 65-inch Samsung TV that receives broadcasts through a high-definition antenna on Huber’s roof. Over-the-air broadcasts often have lower latency than cable or satellite, he explained, and are far quicker than YouTube TV’s sluggish NFL Sunday Ticket feed. Both of his parents used to gamble on sports through a neighborhood bookie, and Huber recalls placing his first bet at age 8. He learned computer programming just a few years later to write code that handicapped NFL point totals. After running a business for more than 20 years that provided photography, DJing and other wedding-related services, Huber became a full-time bettor in 2018. His midlife career change wasn’t a tough sell with his family, he said: “I make more now in a year than I used to make in a decade.” His operation has come a long way. New Jersey legalized mobile sports betting about a year before Pennsylvania did, so at first Huber would drive across the river to bet at a Garden State McDonald’s, sometimes occupying a booth from noon to midnight. Eventually he bought a house in New Jersey, commuting there on weekends solely to gamble. (He prefers to call himself a “value analyst.”) For his current setup, Huber built a custom magnetized board that holds his dozen smartphones on his desk, allowing him to bang out bets without needing to open and close sportsbook apps. (Pennsylvania has roughly a dozen licensed sportsbooks, and New Jersey has about twice as many.) He also has two HP laptops and three iPads that he uses to monitor line movement across sportsbooks and view spreadsheets with his predictive models. Lately, however, he likes to put some of that information on his wall of screens, side by side with games, so he’s not “jerking my neck like crazy” day and night, he said. The setup, he said, cost about $25,000. “I obviously wouldn’t spend that much for my own personal viewing,” he said. “This is just for work.” Underscoring his point, a home theater with seven leather recliners is one room over. Michael Riordan is one of about 15 people spread across the country who handicap for the Right Angle Sports betting group. They specialize in college basketball and football, which is why Riordan likes to take in as many games as possible — within reason, he added: It’s only possible to watch so many basketball games at once without feeling dizzy. His office includes an 85-inch LG with a smaller Roku TV to one side and two Samsung TVs to the other. The Right Angle Sports group mostly bets pregame rather than live, but when Riordan wagers during games, it’s useful to keep an eye on possible injuries and foul trouble. On the middle of his desk is a laptop by MSI, which specializes in high processing needed for video games. Riordan likes having the ability to keep dozens of Google Chrome tabs open without hiccups, displayed across two smaller laptops and one 49-inch curved Samsung monitor. He also has a $370 speaker from Yamaha that he uses to spend hours on conference calls with his company. It’s noise-canceling, allowing him to keep the TV volume low. Riordan prefers handicapping. “The betting itself feels like work,” he said, “but I’m not roofing in the summer, so I’m not complaining. That’s the job.” From a home office looking out on palm trees and the Pacific Ocean, a pro bettor named Jeffrey spends many days this time of year watching college basketball from 5 in the morning until about 10 at night. Online sports betting remains illegal in California, but plenty of offshore sportsbooks take bets no matter where you live. The bettor, who spoke on the condition that only his first name be used to help him avoid scrutiny from sportsbooks, studies tape like an overworked assistant coach and watches as many live games as possible. On a recent Saturday he had 20 basketball games on at once, with four playing across each of his TVs: an 85-inch Sony and a pair of 50-inch Sonys on either side. Some pro bettors claim to rarely watch sports, arguing that gambling is a numbers game for which spreadsheets are all that matters. Jeffrey doesn’t see it that way. “You want to put yourself in a position to stumble into something useful,” he explained, offering two recent examples: During halftime of a basketball game between Villanova and Le Moyne, Fox Sports 1 went live to the Le Moyne locker room, where the coach was imploring his players to focus on transition defense. In another game between Tennessee Tech and Tennessee, Jeffrey noticed Tennessee Tech’s coach waving at his point guard to slow down so he could call plays. “That’s info I wouldn’t get if I wasn’t watching,” Jeffrey said. Both observations led him to successfully bet the under on the second-half point total. His desk includes a 27-inch Dell computer and a MacBook Pro with two 34-inch LG monitors. On an adjacent desk are four neat stacks of paper, each as tall as a phone book, with his research and notes. “I probably have more paper on my desk than the president does in the Oval Office,” he said. A recent move from New York City to Charleston provided an opportunity for John Shilling to build “my dream sports betting home office,” he said. A full-time sports bettor for the past few years, he mostly gambles on golf, and because he rarely bets during rounds, he has no need for a sports bar worth of TVs. He sits surrounded by a semicircle of screens. To his left is a 24-inch smart TV, which is helpful for keeping tabs on course conditions. Most of his focus is on his computer, spread over three 27-inch monitors — large enough to accommodate two browser windows each. Typically, Shilling uses one screen for an odds aggregator, one for sportsbooks and one for his own Microsoft Excel-based model. Running a desktop across three oversized monitors creates a heavy processing burden, and Shilling said a “top-of-line” graphics card is “of the utmost importance.” In all, he said, his setup cost about $3,000. Online sports betting is now legal in more than two-thirds of U.S. states. It also has been legal since 2021 in Canada, where Andrew Pace lives. The founder of inplayLIVE, Pace has been wagering about a decade longer than that. At first, “I wanted to turn my living room into more of a sports bar,” he said, so he bought three TVs on Craigslist. His setup these days could put some sportsbooks to shame. Pace watches games across nine 46-inch screens mounted on his wall. Like Huber’s setup, Pace’s screens are flush, allowing him to display one game across all 120 inches. For his sunlight-filled office, Pace bought Samsung monitors with glare-resistant matte displays. The monitors are connected to his computer, allowing him to drag and drop games in whatever configuration he wants. Maximizing “screen real estate,” he said, is important when live betting because game information presented on sportsbooks — such as the score and time remaining — is occasionally off. His monthly bill for six coaxial cable boxes, high-speed internet and various sports packages adds up to about $700. Pace’s desk is covered with four MacBook Pro laptops, three iPads and an iMac.

"PORTLAND, Ore. — Across the street from where his youth soccer teams practice, Kaig Lightner stepped through a garage door behind an old industrial building on a cold Monday night in November. Car seats sat on the concrete floor in a corner. A refrigerator hummed in the back, and plywood tables lined the drab walls. Lightner and a dozen other coaches and volunteers from the Portland Community Football Club began to sort bags of flour and rice. They unpacked boxes of macaroni with jars of spaghetti sauce and set them out on the tables alongside rolls of toilet paper, bars of soap and packs of toothbrushes. PORTLAND, Ore. — Across the street from where his youth soccer teams practice, Kaig Lightner stepped through a garage door behind an old industrial building on a cold Monday night in November. Car seats sat on the concrete floor in a corner. A refrigerator hummed in the back, and plywood tables lined the drab walls. Lightner and a dozen other coaches and volunteers from the Portland Community Football Club began to sort bags of flour and rice. They unpacked boxes of macaroni with jars of spaghetti sauce and set them out on the tables alongside rolls of toilet paper, bars of soap and packs of toothbrushes. Soon, Lightner’s players and their families began to pull into the cramped parking lot in front of the garage, as they do every month to receive food and toiletries. It was three nights before Thanksgiving, the temperatures had dropped, and everyone was paying more for heat. The kids and their parents were bundled up as they walked in with empty cloth grocery bags and boxes, and Lightner met each of them with a big smile and a hug. The kids hadn’t been able to play soccer for weeks after a strike by local teachers shut down their field. That night, Lightner asked his players if they had been practicing on their own. Then he told them to grab whatever they needed. “This will help us a lot,” said Diego Sanchez Tasej, whose two children have played for PCFC and whose daughter accompanied him to the garage to collect supplies. “Everyone is welcome.” These were the same families Lightner had been scared might cut ties with his program after he came out as a transgender man seven years before. None of them left. Instead, they accepted him and, for the first time in his life as a coach, gave him a place to fully belong. Now their program is stronger than ever, with nearly double the participation and an operating budget increase over the past year. It is an outlier in a youth sports landscape that is ruled by pay-to-play, an industry through which billions of private equity dollars flow, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Lightner offers an alternative: a pay-what-you-can model that provides Portland’s marginalized youths an affordable soccer program and helps players and their families navigate social service systems. “When I tell most people what I do, a lot of them say, ‘Oh, that’s so cute,’ ” Lightner said. “This isn’t cute camp. We are actually a youth soccer club with wraparound services. We want to start a national movement. We know this can work in other communities.” Portland is among the Whitest cities in the country, and for years Lightner observed the lack of opportunities for the city’s underrepresented kids. He launched PCFC in 2013 to serve low-income, racially diverse and LGBTQ+ youths, spreading the word through schools and free clinics. Many of them had never played on an organized soccer team. Most did not have cleats or shin guards. Lightner charged $50 to join, but if a family didn’t have that much — or had no money at all — the kids could still play, and Lightner would often drive them to and from practices. No one was cut, and teams were not divided by gender. Lightner didn’t want to churn out elite prospects. He focused on developing players by giving them access to skilled coaches and quality competition, and he became a father figure to many of them. Yet he knew the club could not reach its full potential as an inclusive and equitable space until he told them fully about himself. On a rainy day in May 2017, he called his players together in the middle of the field before practice. The group of kids were mostly first- and second-generation immigrants. He could feel his body shake with nerves. “I haven’t totally shared something about myself that is kind of important,” he  . “It’s an important thing for me to share with you because we all should be who we are; we all should be exactly who we want to be.” The players grew silent. Lightner fidgeted with the zipper on his green jacket. His voice wavered. “Some of you may or may not know this, but I am transgender,” he said. Some of the kids sheepishly laughed. One of them asked how old Lightner was. Another one walked up to Lightner and wrapped his arms around him. “If you think about someone like me, I was born a girl. I didn’t really feel like I was a girl. I really felt like a boy. But I had to play soccer as a girl. I was raised a girl,” Lightner told his players. “I got told a lot of things as a soccer player as a girl, that I couldn’t do this, I couldn’t do that. I wasn’t good enough, I wasn’t strong enough, or I was too strong, I acted too much like a boy,” he continued. “… I bet you all have had somebody say something about the color of your skin, or the way you talk, or the country your parents are from, or any of that; that is really similar to how I got treated as a kid, too.”  in 1980, and by the time he was 4 years old, he felt he was a boy. He loved playing with G.I. Joes and Legos while growing up in a leafy suburb of Seattle. He dressed like a boy and encountered relentless bullying from the second grade through high school as others questioned his gender identity nearly every day. Lightner was obsessed with sports. He excelled at volleyball, soccer, basketball and softball, and by the time he was 15, he had discovered coaching. By 17, he was the coach of his own girls’ soccer team, and he had found his life’s work. “I was just like: ‘Wow, this is so amazing. This is naturally so easy for me,' ” he said. After rowing crew at the University of Washington, where he competed with the women’s team but was often mistaken for a member of the men’s, he moved to Portland. By 2007, he had changed his name to Kaig (pronounced Cage) and began taking testosterone. He flew to Baltimore with his parents to have gender-affirming surgery, and after a week of recovery in a hotel, he began to see the change in his physical appearance that he had always wanted. Lightner returned to Portland and devoted himself to social work with young people whom he hadn’t seen on the fields while volunteer coaching in some of the wealthiest parts of the city. He sketched out his idea for a new club on a piece of paper and by 2013, aided by a grant from Nike, launched PCFC. He had come out to everyone but his players. He was worried about the narratives in the coaching community that get attached to out coaches and decided to focus on building his club. But in 2017, when he gathered with a group of coaches at a conference, one of them asked, “Kaig, you’re out to your players, right?” When Lightner said no, the coach told Lightner he had an important story to tell to those who looked up to him. “I was very nervous. I was very unsure of what it would be. How would people respond? Would people walk off the field? Would kids just look at me like I’m a total freak? I spent many decades of my life thinking of myself as a freak and thinking of myself as somebody who did not belong,” Lightner said. “I was having a hard time getting my words at first,” he continued. “As soon as the word ‘transgender’ came out of my mouth and I looked across all those kids and nobody walked away, nobody did anything . . . it was the final frontier for me.” The club continued to grow, and in 2019 Lightner faced his first real crisis as a manager. A PCFC parent had been served an eviction notice and was going to be thrown out of an apartment in 72 hours. The kids would be out on the street, and Lightner had no money to give. The best he could do was connect the family with housing services across the city. Lightner felt he had not done enough. The next year, as the pandemic kept the program off the field for months, Lightner devoted some funding intended for soccer, along with a   relief grant, to social services for his families. He and his staff acted as intermediaries to help the families navigate housing applications. The club worked with a pro-bono law firm to provide legal support when needed. If parents or their kids needed mental health counseling, the club arranged it. PCFC set up a food pantry and donated whatever funds it could to help families with emergencies. When one of the families’ homes burned down, Lightner scraped together $300 and dipped into the club’s budget to help buy the family clothes and gift cards. Even after the pandemic, the club has continued to secure funding to help families off the field. Last spring, when a family immigrated and signed its kids up to play, they were temporarily living in a shelter. Within 72 hours, Carolina Hernandez Morales, PCFC’s Family Services Manager, helped find them an apartment and bought them food, diapers and clothing. “They try their best to support families in every way possible. Sometimes, when they have extra clothing [at the food bank], that’s very helpful. If you need resources with electricity, if you need resources with rent, they do their best to accommodate you,” said Marisol Lozano, whose two children, 12-year-old Antonio and 13-year-old Solei, have played for PCFC for five years. “It has really impacted our lives, significantly. [Lightner] is always making you feel very welcome, like you’re a part of it, like, ‘What can we do to help?’ That’s very important to me, I feel, because he’s the first person we got used to seeing all the time. The kids got really attached to him.” Those attachments and relationships to the kids and families keep Lightner going. But he has wrestled with a complex question: How can PCFC continue to grow, even inspire other clubs nationally to adopt its model, without sacrificing the program’s soul? PCFC’s numbers have grown from 75 to more than 200, but Lightner doesn’t want to grow for the sake of growing. The night after the club’s monthly food drive in November, he found a quiet corner at a food court on the east side of the city to meet with Nina Byrd, a well-known consultant and business strategist in Portland. Byrd pulled out her laptop and showed Lightner a presentation from the Aspen Institute of the   on youth sports participation and trends, which included a few bright spots. A national poll found 52 percent of Americans believe youth sports deserve public funding, that some state governments are leaning toward pouring more money into sports activities in disadvantaged communities and that philanthropic investment in elementary school and middle school sports is increasing in some major cities. But the report also outlined a pervasive issue: The industry is still being affected by billions of dollars in private equity, and that has caused many big organizations to grow and smaller clubs to shrink. Lightner and Byrd talked about how those trends might impact the club and Lightner’s national campaign, which is called  . “PCFC is the model that can change the industry,” Byrd told Lightner.  in Lightner’s office, hanging next to a photo of Ted Lasso and the decade-old sheet of paper with the initial plans for PCFC, is a list labeled “Big Dreams.” He wants to one day build a clubhouse for the team, have a full-time food pantry, have a consistent playing space for his kids and hold classes on cooking, nutrition and sports and medicine. With the teachers’ strike ongoing, it had been a difficult month for Lozano, the mother of two PCFC players. She could tell her children, without school or soccer, were struggling emotionally. A single parent, Lozano was trying to keep them active by holding drills in the living room of their apartment while also starting a new remote job. “In my house, soccer is a passion. We take it serious,” said Lozano, whose children were finally able to return to the field in early December when the strike ended. At the first practice in weeks, the stadium lights popped on once the sun went down, a reminder to Lightner of all the times in its early years when the club practiced in the dark at a local park. As he watched his players scrimmage, he jumped in and played with them. Then he called the players together and talked to them about making good decisions. “In those moments, in any coaching moment,” he said, “I feel completely as one whole person.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/20/kaig-lightner-youth-soccer-portland/,Washington Post,2023-12-21 19:33:00,

Franklin (D-Woodbridge) will seek her party’s nomination for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, becoming the third candidate to officially join the primary after Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) declined to run for reelection and launched a bid for governor. Franklin, 37, is a public-affairs professional and former congressional aide who earlier this month was reelected to her second term on the Prince William board, where she has created grant programs for small businesses and housing assistance in this Northern Virginia exurb. “We’ve been pretty aggressive about hitting the ground running even on the local level,” she said in an interview ahead of the announcement. “That’s going to serve me well again on day one to serve the 7th Congressional District.” Spanberger won the newly drawn seat by about four points last year, surpassing expectations as she competed in a purple swath of the state that was entirely new to her. But the district, which includes the booming Interstate 95 corridor and more rural areas to the west, remains competitive — especially without an incumbent. A national Republican campaign arm signaled earlier this month that it is “all hands on deck” to flip the seat as it looks to maintain a slim majority in the House of Representatives. Two candidates have formally announced plans to seek the Democratic nomination in June’s party primary:   (Prince William) and  , a retired Army colonel whose report helped lead to the first   against former president  . Del. Elizabeth R. Guzman (Prince William) and state Sen. Jeremy S. McPike (Prince William) are also exploring runs. The list of other potential contenders is even longer, including Stafford County Board of Supervisors Chair Pamela Yeung, former delegate and lieutenant governor nominee Hala Ayala, and Prince William County School Board Chairman Babur B. Lateef. There are at least four candidates who have filed paperwork to seek the Republican nomination: Derrick Anderson, a combat veteran and former Green Beret who came in second in last year’s  ; Cameron Hamilton, a Navy SEAL veteran and former Department of Homeland Security official; Marine Corps veteran Jon Myers; and tech entrepreneur Bill Moher. While some candidates in both primaries have tried to shine a spotlight on some of the partisan gridlock plaguing Capitol Hill, Franklin in an interview pitched herself as a champion for working families with the legislative chops necessary to get things done. “The 7th Congressional District deserves a leader that can be effective,” she said, “and my experience both in Congress and on the board of supervisors allows me to be that individual.” Franklin spent about a decade in Congress working in the offices of Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and as the legislative director for former congressman Al Lawson (D-Fla.). While in Gillibrand’s office, she worked on bills to expand voting rights and crack down on gun trafficking, she said, and led a group for Black Senate staffers. Her campaign announcement Monday included endorsements from both Adams and Lawson as well as fellow Prince William supervisor Victor S. Angry (D-Neabsco). In 2019, Franklin unseated an incumbent Democrat on the Prince William board and became one of the first African American women on the body overseeing the booming, increasingly diverse county   from GOP to Democratic control. Before easily winning reelection this month, she pushed to create a housing assistance program to help low-income families avoid eviction and a centralized government center to fight child abuse. She is the only local elected official so far in a race that includes opponents with greater name recognition. Vindman, who has already made several appearances on MSNBC amid critiques that he is out of touch with the district, raised over $800,000 in the first 24 hours after launching his campaign, according to a news release. Franklin said she has always been focused on her constituents and other district residents — not the other candidates in the race. “I don’t make my decisions based on who’s there and who’s not there,” she said. “I make my decisions based on, ‘What are the needs of the community, and can I serve at that level?’”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/27/virginia-7th-congressional-district-margaret-franklin-prince-william/,Washington Post,2023-11-27 15:15:00,
"Three days before Capital Centre was scheduled to open 50 years ago Saturday — on Dec. 2, 1973 — Washington Bullets owner Abe Pollin was dispatching aides by jet to Syracuse, N.Y., and Thomasville, Ga., to secure special parts for his new sports and entertainment arena’s sewage treatment plant. Earlier that week, the plant had failed an inspection by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, which discovered 23 safety and operational deficiencies. Understandably, Prince George’s County officials refused to issue a use and occupancy permit for the $16 million saddle-shaped arena in Landover, Md., that Pollin had spent the previous 15 months building until those problems were resolved. Three days before Capital Centre was scheduled to open 50 years ago Saturday — on Dec. 2, 1973 — Washington Bullets owner Abe Pollin was dispatching aides by jet to Syracuse, N.Y., and Thomasville, Ga., to secure special parts for his new sports and entertainment arena’s sewage treatment plant. Earlier that week, the plant had failed an inspection by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, which discovered 23 safety and operational deficiencies. Understandably, Prince George’s County officials refused to issue a use and occupancy permit for the $16 million saddle-shaped arena in Landover, Md., that Pollin had spent the previous 15 months building until those problems were resolved. “We can’t expect 17,500 people [to come] to a ballgame and not have anyone go to the bathroom,” Jay F. Morris, an executive aide to Prince George’s County Executive William W. Gullett, told The Washington Post. Pollin wasn’t worried. “We’re going to open [on schedule],” he told The Post as he paced about the plant’s site in a hard hat. The next day, after the necessary parts were installed, Maryland health secretary Neil Solomon granted permission for the plant on the Patuxent River near Upper Marlboro to begin operation while also making it clear he wouldn’t hesitate to shut it — and the new arena it served — down. “There’s no question that if the thing malfunctions, [Solomon] will blow the whistle in the third quarter,” a spokesman for the state health department said. That wouldn’t be necessary. The only notable blockage when Capital Centre opened to a sellout crowd of 17,500 two nights later was Elvin Hayes swatting a pair of shots in the final five seconds to preserve the Bullets’   over the Seattle SuperSonics. In October 1964, Pollin, who had made a fortune as a contractor, and two partners purchased the NBA’s Baltimore Bullets from Dave Trager. The team became a success in the standings, especially after Wes Unseld arrived as a rookie in 1968, but the Bullets struggled to draw large crowds at Baltimore Civic Center and were losing money every year. After buying out his partners in 1968, Pollin began seeking a new home for his team. In June 1972, with the help of Los Angeles Kings owner Jack Kent Cooke, who would become majority owner of Washington’s NFL team two years later, Pollin was awarded an expansion NHL franchise. The deal was contingent on a new arena being built by the start of the 1974-75 season. Pollin, who was raised in D.C., considered several potential locations for an arena in the District, including behind Union Station and at Mount Vernon Square, but he was unable to find a suitable site or secure a guarantee from city officials that the project would be completed in time. Pollin settled on a 60-acre tract of land off the Capital Beltway in Prince George’s County, where he would  , and broke ground at the site Aug. 24, 1972. Virginia Republican congressman Joel T. Broyhill, who met with Pollin along with D.C. Mayor Walter E. Washington to persuade him to change his mind, called Pollin’s decision a “real disappointment, injurious to the economy of the District.” Pollin hoped to have the Bullets, who were renamed the Capital Bullets in February 1973, open the 1973-74 season at Capital Centre, but rain and legal hurdles delayed the ambitious timeline. Pollin arranged for the Bullets to play up to their first 10 home games at Maryland’s Cole Field House, where the team had played a handful of home games over the previous few seasons. The Bullets drew crowds twice as large in College Park as they did in Baltimore, but the team was looking forward to settling into its permanent new digs, where the court figured to be more forgiving than Cole Field House’s hardwood-over-concrete surface. “Moving into the Capital Centre will make all of us happy, for Wes [Unseld’s] sake,” Bullets Coach K.C. Jones said. “That floor doesn’t help his knee at all.” Capital Centre promised to be more comfortable for fans, too. The venue featured padded seats, all of which were within 200 feet of the center of the arena floor, along with 10 concession booths and 40 suites. The most impressive addition was the $1.25 million Telscreen — a four-sided, center-hung scoreboard with 12-by-14-foot screens capable of showing instant replays in color. “We like to think of it as a building with a heart … if that isn’t being too dramatic,” Steve Stearns, Capital Centre’s director of marketing, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch in May 1973. “At every turn the fan has been put first.” The week leading up to the opening of Capital Centre was a whirlwind as Pollin’s contractors worked three eight-hour shifts around-the-clock to meet the Dec. 2 deadline. The final approval from county inspectors came less than four hours before tip-off as some of the arena’s royal blue and red seats were still being installed. Pollin gave everyone who worked on the construction of the building free tickets to the first game. “What Pollin is unveiling in the unofficial opening at 7:35 p.m. is basically an ugly duckling that is expected to turn into one of the country’s most spectacular arenas early in 1974,” The Post reported. “The official dedication is scheduled sometime in January in the form of ‘a benefit spectacular show’ to raise funds for a special charity.” On opening night, Pollin hired a helicopter to help direct traffic to the arena’s 6,500 parking spaces in four lots named Capitol, Liberty Bell, Stars and Stripes and Eagle. During a pregame ceremony involving Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel, Pollin addressed the sellout crowd from center court. “All of us have tried very, very hard to make the Capital Centre the pride of the nation,” he said. “You, the people, will be the judge.” The Bullets took a 54-47 lead into halftime, during which a preview of “Disney on Parade” played on the fancy new scoreboard. Baskets by Hayes and rookie Nick Weatherspoon gave the home team a 98-94 lead with 22 seconds remaining before Seattle’s John Brisker made a shot and the SuperSonics stole the ball from Bullets guard Archie Clark. Hayes blocked Don Watts’s shot and then rejected Brisker’s putback in front of the basket to seal the win. Hayes finished with 36 points and 29 rebounds, and the Bullets overcame 24 turnovers to move a half-game ahead of Atlanta in the NBA’s Central Division. “It was the most exciting thing I’ve ever been a part of — it all went beautifully,” Capital Centre president Jerry Sachs said afterward. Except, apparently, for the cold hot dogs The Post reported were sold at concession stands. “Listen, we’re lucky we’ve got hot dogs,” a concessions official said. A sellout crowd saw the Allman Brothers perform the following night, and the Who, Johnny Cash and the Harlem Globetrotters all made stops in Landover during the arena’s busy first month. The Bullets averaged more than 10,000 fans in 1973-74. The Capitals began play there the next season, and it became the new home of the Georgetown men’s basketball team in 1981. Capital Centre, which was later renamed USAir Arena and US Airways Arena, was home to memorable — and dimly lit — moments over the next 24 years, including the Bullets’ 1978 championship season, the   and countless rock concerts. It was  . Five years earlier, the Wizards and Capitals moved into   in downtown D.C., which they still call home.

The 34-year-old Raanta made 18 saves in his first NHL game since Dec. 15. “Just good to get him back in there and get him hopefully feeling good about the way things went,” Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour said. Raanta was placed on waivers and completed an assignment in the American Hockey League before being recalled this week. He was the backup for the victory against the Predators. “It’s a big win for him and hopefully it’s going to give him confidence,” Svechnikov said. Mitchell Stephens, Mike Matheson and Josh Anderson scored for the Canadiens, who were coming off a five-day holiday break. Cayden Primeau, son of former Hurricanes captain Keith Primeau, made 26 stops in his first game against Carolina.

"NEW YORK — Seventy minutes before the New York Liberty faced elimination in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, Jonquel Jones strode onto the court with a stoic look on her face. As the 2021 MVP began her pregame workout Sunday, “Super Gremlin” by Kodak Black played over the speakers at Barclays Center. NEW YORK — Seventy minutes before the New York Liberty faced elimination in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals, Jonquel Jones strode onto the court with a stoic look on her face. As the 2021 MVP began her pregame workout Sunday, “Super Gremlin” by Kodak Black played over the speakers at Barclays Center. For days, Jones and her Liberty teammates had talked about having some pride, and this raucous environment would be no safe haven for the championship-minded Las Vegas Aces. After being embarrassed for two games in the desert, New York trailed for just 19 seconds of its 87-73 victory Sunday to force Game 4 on Wednesday night. A sold-out crowd of 17,143 had the building shaking as the best-of-five series arrived in New York. Jones set the tone and finished with 27 points, eight rebounds, three blocks, three assists and two steals, denying Las Vegas back-to-back titles on this afternoon. “I just came in energized,” she said, “energized that we had a new opportunity. Just playing with a lot of passion and just not wanting to let the moment pass us by and have that ‘what if?’ type of feeling.” Added Liberty Coach Sandy Brondello: “JJ’s voice has been heard these last few days.” The defeat was painful enough for the Aces, but losing Chelsea Gray in the fourth quarter was even scarier; she was seen on crutches after the game. Coach Becky Hammon didn’t have an injury update when she spoke with reporters but said she believed it was a foot injury. If Gray is unavailable for Game 4, Hammon said Kelsey Plum would slide over and point guard responsibilities would be handled by committee. Last year with the Connecticut Sun, Jones was in this same position, down 2-0 in the Finals after two losses in Las Vegas before her team returned home and took Game 3. (The Aces ultimately won in four games.) She knew what it would take Sunday, and the Liberty showed real fight by coming out with much more physicality. Brondello had preached for days about a need for urgency and to show some grit after her team  , and the opening 10 minutes showed her players got the message. Jones was flummoxed in the first two games, and she took it personally. On Sunday, she made three-pointers in transition, and she got to the rim and the free throw line. She finished 4 for 7 from three-point range, giving the Aces a different look. New York took a 21-12 lead on a Sabrina Ionescu three that was set up by a Jones block of A’ja Wilson. That was the largest Liberty lead of the series at the time — and Vegas’s largest deficit of the playoffs. The Liberty was ahead 21-18 at the end of the first quarter. “She hit threes on a consistent clip,” Hammon said. “There’s some things I think we can do better, but give her credit. ... We can do a better job mixing up our looks, [show] more sense of urgency, getting out to shooters, [do a] better job of keeping the ball in front.” Jones continued to set the pace in the second quarter; Plum (game-high 29 points) did most of the heavy lifting on offense for the Aces as her teammates struggled. Jones had 18 points by halftime, and Plum had 15; no other player had more than nine by the time Lil’ Kim came out to perform. Still, the Aces trailed just 43-40. But the third quarter wasn’t what Las Vegas was looking for: The Liberty opened with a 12-3 run and took a 61-50 lead into the final 10 minutes. Las Vegas got within six in the fourth, but New York responded with a 12-3 surge to secure the win. Las Vegas, which seemed to make everything in the first two games, shot 33.3 percent from the field and 31.8 percent from behind the arc. New York regained its touch and finished 13 for 30 (43.3 percent) from long range while shooting 52.4 percent from the field. Breanna Stewart had 20 points, 12 rebounds, four assists and two blocks for New York. Wilson had 16 points and 11 rebounds for the Aces. “We were stagnant — similar to the first couple times we played here this season,” Plum said. “When they’re able to like load up and come swarm the ball, it’s really hard to get good looks.” The celebrity-heavy crowds kept coming after the series shifted to New York: Basketball Hall of Famer Tony Parker, South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley, broadcaster Robin Roberts, actor Michael Shannon, new Chicago Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon, coaching legend C. Vivian Stringer, singer Joan Jett, actor Jason Sudeikis, music producer Swizz Beatz, former WNBA star Sue Bird and a number of NBA players were in attendance. They got to see the Liberty return to form — and the WNBA Finals become competitive again. “Just taking a look at ourselves and taking a look in the mirror and understanding the basketball that we played those two games in Vegas wasn’t anything that we were proud of,” Stewart said. “And making sure that we came together even more as a team. ... It’s a roller-coaster journey.

"The Florida State University board of trustees sued the ACC on Friday, challenging a contract that ties the school to the league while creating a potential path for FSU to leave the conference without paying more than $500 million in penalties. That decision came less than 24 hours after the ACC sued the school’s trustees arguing it has not breached that contract. The Florida State University board of trustees sued the ACC on Friday, challenging a contract that ties the school to the league while creating a potential path for FSU to leave the conference without paying more than $500 million in penalties. That decision came less than 24 hours after the ACC sued the school’s trustees arguing it has not breached that contract. Florida State filed its 38-page in Leon County Circuit Court in Tallahassee. That complaint, which was filed Friday after a virtual board meeting to approve the action, became public first. In it, the university  the ACC has mismanaged its media rights and prevents member schools from joining other conferences through “draconian” withdrawal penalties. FSU accused the ACC of restraint of trade, breach of contract and failure to perform. “Through chronic fiduciary mismanagement and bad faith, the ACC has persistently undermined its members’ revenue opportunities including by locking them into a deteriorating media rights agreement that will soon result in a vast annual financial gap between the ACC and other Power Five (soon to be Power Four) conferences,” it said in the complaint. “Those failures have, by design, coalesced with the ACC’s efforts to effectively deprive ACC members of their fundamental right to withdraw, through the combination of an unconscionable Grant of Rights provision and a prohibitive Withdrawal Penalty that are unparalleled in the history of intercollegiate athletics.” The Charlotte-based ACC filed its own 33-page   Thursday evening in Mecklenburg County Superior Court. It argues the league’s exit penalties are enforceable because Florida State “knowingly and voluntarily” granted “irrevocable” and “exclusive” TV rights for FSU home games to the ACC through 2036. Florida State authorized those privileges through a contract called a grant of rights, which is a legal document that transfers the ownership of media rights from member schools to the conference for a set length of time. “At its core, this case involves the legal promises of Florida State and its obligations to the Conference to which it has belonged and from which it has profited from for more than 30 years,” the conference said in its lawsuit. “In 2013 and 2016, Florida State, along with the other Members of the ACC, agreed to and executed a ‘Grants of Rights’ through which it transferred the exclusive media rights to all its ‘home’ games contests to the Conference (the ‘Media Rights’). “Florida State and the other Members of the ACC made these grants so that the Conference could negotiate a long-term contract and agreements with ESPN. By aggregating these collective Media Rights in the Conference, the Members were able to realize more value from those Media Rights than if they had each attempted to market them separately.” : The Atlantic Coast Conference has filed a lawsuit against the Board of Trustees that was filed yesterday in Mecklenburg County. On page four, the ACC claims that “Florida State matters regarding the ACC are subject to the jurisdiction of the state of North Carolina.”  Florida State joined the ACC in 1991, but over the past year-plus, it has been the most vocal among member schools raising concerns over the league’s growing revenue gap in relation to the Big Ten and SEC. Florida State President Rick McCullough   in August, “Without increasing revenue, we will face major challenges to be able to compete in football.” Last year, the Big Ten unveiled a seven-year   worth more than $1 billion per year, which is expected to bump its annual revenue distributions per school to around $70 million. The SEC could raise its per-school payouts to similar levels when Texas and Oklahoma officially join the league next year. The ACC’s annual allotments have steadily risen, and it   an average distribution of $39.4 million to its members for the 2021-22 school year. For comparison, the Big Ten ($58.8 million), SEC ($49.9 million) and Big 12 ($42 million to $44.9 million) distributed more money to their schools during that same period, according to  . The Pac-12 was last among the Power Five conferences at $37 million. (The ACC in September   to add Stanford, California and SMU to its ranks beginning next school year. Stanford and Cal will receive reduced television-revenue shares over   in the ACC, while SMU will receive no TV money in that span). After the Big Ten poached Maryland from the ACC in 2012, during a period of extensive realignment, ACC schools in response signed a grant of rights to keep the league intact and to preclude remaining members from leaving. The original agreement ran through June 2027, but in 2016, members extended their grant of media rights through 2036. By this past summer, Clemson, Miami, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech and Florida State probed the grant for potential loopholes. With Friday’s decision, which follows Florida State’s recent exclusion from the College Football Playoff, the school is taking the first step in plotting a potential exit from the conference. ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips and Virginia President Jim Ryan, chairman of the league’s board of directors, lamented Florida State’s legal action Friday, arguing that the school “willingly and knowingly re-signed the current Grant of Rights.” In a  , they expressed confidence “that the Grant of Rights, which has been honored by all other universities who signed similar agreements, will be affirmed by the courts.” “Florida State’s decision to file action against the Conference is in direct conflict with their longstanding obligations and is a clear violation of their legal commitments to the other members of the Conference,” they said. “All ACC members, including Florida State, willingly and knowingly re-signed the current Grant of Rights in 2016, which is wholly enforceable and binding through 2036. Each university has benefited from this agreement, receiving millions of dollars in revenue and neither Florida State nor any other institution, has ever challenged its legitimacy.” Florida State estimates it would pay a total exit fee of $572 million. That sum includes the ACC’s $130 million withdrawal fee, plus an additional $442 million related to the university’s forfeiture of media rights and unreimbursed broadcast fees. If a judge — or judges — rule in Florida State’s favor, the school would be free to depart the conference without penalty. A judgment in favor of the ACC could see FSU stay in the league or pay the financial penalty to leave; both parties may also reach a settlement. In its statement regarding the lawsuit, Florida State added that the ACC “continued to erode its media rights position by rushing to admit three new schools with weak media rights values.” The school argued those actions further hurt the conference’s ability to negotiate for increases in revenue payments when its contract is up for renewal. “This filing became necessary due to an unwillingness by the ACC and some of our fellow conference members to seriously consider remedies for this situation,” Florida State Athletic Director Michael Alford said. “It is with great regret that we enter this phase, but it has become clear that we have no other recourse.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/22/florida-state-sues-acc/,Washington Post,2023-12-22 19:56:00,
"Ja Morant has been a ghost, a pariah and a punchline for the past eight months, a mesmerizing prodigy whose propensity for flashing firearms stopped his career cold. The Memphis Grizzlies guard clammed up during his second gun-related suspension of the year,  . Ja Morant has been a ghost, a pariah and a punchline for the past eight months, a mesmerizing prodigy whose propensity for flashing firearms stopped his career cold. The Memphis Grizzlies guard clammed up during his second gun-related suspension of the year,  . But when Morant finally returned to the basketball court Tuesday — just eight days after he testified at a county courthouse in Tennessee in a lawsuit alleging he assaulted a teenager — the 24-year-old star made it clear he remains a franchise-changing, game-winning talent. In his first action of the season following a 25-game suspension, Morant had 34 points, six rebounds and eight assists to lead the Grizzlies to a 115-113 road victory over the New Orleans Pelicans. Morant capped his debut with a spinning buzzer-beater that completed a furious comeback from a 24-point first-half deficit and snapped Memphis’s five-game losing streak. “I felt like it was the perfect ending,” Morant said. “The perfect day — being able to come back and play and also deliver a game-winner. Over this little bit of time, I’ve been putting a lot of trust in God, getting even closer with God. I know He has a plan for me. I feel like it’s already written. I’m letting Him lead me.” The Grizzlies (7-19), adrift without Morant, plunged from the Western Conference’s No. 2 seed last year to 13th place in the standings this season. They have plenty of work to do to get back into the play-in tournament picture, let alone claim a playoff spot for a fourth straight year. Morant’s return clearly energized the group, though, and he provided repeated reminders that he is a capable savior for an offense that ranks last in the NBA. “It felt different out there having our guy back, our leader,” Grizzlies guard Desmond Bane said. “He does so much for us on the court, but the spirit and the energy that he plays with is infectious.” Morant bolted out of the gates, driving the lane to earn free throws in the opening minute and scrounging up his first bucket shortly thereafter in the paint. Grizzlies Coach Taylor Jenkins opted against drastically limiting Morant’s minutes, instead playing him in shorter bursts in the first half before turning him loose down the stretch. There was evidence of rust early and signs of fatigue late: Morant committed five turnovers, including several wild passes out of bounds, and he used a massage gun to stave off cramps during a timeout in the game’s final minute. The Grizzlies also seemed to be adjusting on the fly to his breakneck pace, and they looked lost when he went to the bench midway through the second quarter and New Orleans ripped off a 23-0 run. Morant said he expected “jitters” and moments of miscommunication with his teammates, and he shook off boos from the Smoothie King Center crowd. Even so, it didn’t take long for the two-time all-star to remind everyone how difficult he is to keep out of the paint. Twice Morant drove to the hoop so hard that he finished layups by crashing to the court and dismounting into a somersault. He salivated when given the opportunity to work against New Orleans big men Zion Williamson and Jonas Valanciunas, and he got where he wanted to go even when he was shadowed by Herbert Jones, one of the league’s best perimeter defenders. At one point, Morant scored on Jose Alvarado, who is generously listed at 6-foot, and motioned that the Pelicans guard was “too small.” As Memphis chipped away at the Grizzlies’ lead, it leaned harder and harder on Morant, who asked for a breather in the third quarter before playing the final eight-plus minutes of regulation. Morant scored 27 points in the second half, including Memphis’s final six points, to outduel Brandon Ingram, who led New Orleans (16-12) with 34. Despite missing all five of his three-point attempts, Morant shot 12 for 24 from the field — with all of his baskets coming in the paint, including the game-winner. Jenkins set up the final play by taking a timeout with the score tied at 113 and 9.6 seconds left. Morant initially suggested he would work the ball inside to Jaren Jackson Jr., but Jenkins and Bane had other ideas and insisted that Morant get the chance to be the hero. Memphis spaced the court to allow Morant to rev up from the top of the key: He angled left, spun back to his right at the free throw line and found a seam between Jones and Dyson Daniels to loft a double-clutch floater from just outside the restricted area. The shot rattled in as time expired, and Morant was mobbed by his teammates and cheered by his father, Tee, who had a baseline seat. “Ja was spectacular tonight,” Jenkins said. “A special player making a special play. He relishes these moments. He was beyond excited to get out there and be with his teammates and play basketball, the game that he loves. I thought he came out and set a tone for us on both ends of the floor. ... That’s how you want Ja to play: fast and free.” Morant, who was   for flashing a gun on Instagram Live and then  for a similar offense, said he had a “cordial” meeting with Adam Silver last week and plans to continue to speak with the NBA commissioner to build their relationship. Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James was among the NBA luminaries to   Tuesday, and the Grizzlies guard returned the pleasantries by putting on a show. “In this world, a lot of us make mistakes,” he said. “Regardless of if you make a mistake, you have another chance to fix it and reinvent yourself.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/20/ja-morant-returns-buzzer-beater-suspension/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 00:18:00,

Michele Kang expanded her portfolio of women’s soccer clubs, acquiring second-tier English team London City Lionesses. The deal, announced Friday, adds a third team to   this year. In May, she reached an agreement to take over the women’s team of French club Olympique Lyonnais, an eight-time Champions League winner. (That deal is still awaiting approval from French authorities.) Kang, the founder of a health-care technology company,   in 2022 for $35 million, then a record price in the National Women’s Soccer League. “My initial vision [of] the whole multi-club model was the scale, building the scale, in terms of being able to invest in the training, the infrastructure, the training programs. All those things, it’s very hard to do that for one team because we don’t have a billion-dollar media contract. So for us to pool the resources together, that scale matters,” Kang said in an interview. “In terms of moving women’s sports, women’s football to the next level, I don’t think we want to do just one club at a time. We want to accelerate on a global level.” London City Lionesses was established in 2019 after  , where the women’s team struggled for financial support. It operates fully independently and is not tied to a men’s team, a rarity in England’s top two professional leagues. After second- and third-place finishes in the Women’s Championship the past two seasons, London City is ninth in the 12-team standings. “It’s an exciting opportunity, not only for women’s football in this country, not only for London City Lionesses but for football for women globally and sport and giving a level playing field,” said Diane Culligan, the club’s founder. “I think with Michele and with the multi-club strategy, that makes that sort of ambition and the drive a little more attainable.” Building out her multi-club organization, Kang had earmarked England as a priority. The country has seen   in attention and resources to its women’s professional leagues on the heels of the English national team’s success at the   and the World Cup this year. “If you think about where the center of gravity for women’s sports, women’s football, is and are, that’s clearly the U.S. and a lot of major countries in Europe, and England is definitely one of them,” she said. “So I knew that we always had to be in London, in England.” Under the umbrella of Kang’s ownership, clubs will operate with their own staffs and brand identities but share resources and best practices in areas from scouting and data analysis to sports science. Work is underway to develop common infrastructure, starting with the construction of state-of-the-art training centers with matching components and standards for each team. Kang hopes to keep growing the network globally. Initial conversations have been held with teams in Asia, South America and Africa. As the popularity of women’s soccer grows worldwide and further opportunities arise, the scale of a multi-club organization stands to benefit the Spirit, Kang said. “The level of research now we can do, because we have multiple teams and we can pool the resources together, is something that if we had only the Spirit, that would not have been available,” she said. “From a business perspective, globally right now, probably the U.S. has the most advanced women’s football business economics. So we’re building that business model from the Spirit, so the Spirit will be used as sort of the foundational piece.” The Spirit went 7-9-6 this past season and missed the NWSL playoffs.

Those looking to minimize the role of slavery as the economic driver for secession often replace the human rights atrocity with states’ rights as the reason. “States’ rights issue was tied to slavery,” Chitty said, “the right for a state to decide if they wanted to be a free state or a slaveholding state.” The tension was held over from the time of colonization because the country never figured out how to reckon with the nation’s original sin of slavery. “We’re not just boiled down to four years of the war,” Chitty said.

An earlier version of this article gave an incorrect middle initial for Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks. It has been corrected. In their first shared stage in the vote-rich suburbs of D.C., the three Democratic candidates seeking Maryland’s open U.S. Senate seat pitched themselves to the state’s growing Latino population on Sunday, each arguing they could best represent the diverse community’s long-overlooked needs. The promises made during a forum at a high school in Bladensburg frequently overlapped: to seek wholesale immigration reform, to expand voting access for undocumented people, to deliver better health care for noncitizens and to provide a better voice for representing communities that are reshaping the state and nation. “If we can’t vote, we can’t have power. And the Latino community needs power,” Rep. David Trone (D-Md.) said. He added later: “There’s absolutely no question about it: the Latino community in this country has been marginalized, has been left behind, and in many cases left out — not having a seat at the table. Latino communities have got to have a seat at the table.” His chief rival, Prince George’s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks called it “high time” for comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to work on it. And the newest contender in the race, telecom executive Juan Dominguez delivered parts of his comments in Spanish and noted that, as the son of Cuban immigrants, he would be the first Latino Maryland ever sent to Congress. The candidates also pitched building better educational and economic opportunities, pressuring the federal government to pay for more of D.C.'s Metro system or moving aggressively to combat climate change. They each offered slightly different explanations for how they would be tough on repeat violent offenders. Dominguez repeatedly pitched his plan for a “Robinhood tax” to reduce income inequality by taxing the wealthy to pay for programs that broadly benefit society. “I will advocate for not only Latinos — all people of color, working class, middle class — to have the opportunities that they deserve that they don’t have readily today, because, again, our communities have been stripped of their wealth due to the tax code,” he said. Maryland’s rare open Senate seat, prompted by the retirement of Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), produced a highly contested race that has sent Democrats hunting for any advantage. So far, the May 14 primary has largely been a contest between three-term congressman Trone, a self-funded business executive, and two-term Alsobrooks with her phalanx of the state’s Democratic establishment. Dominguez, whose campaign launched months after that of his opponents, so far lacks the funding and name-recognition of his well-established rivals. Sunday’s two-hour forum marked the first time the Latino Democrats of Prince George’s County hosted any campaign forum event — both live-streamed and translated into Spanish — signaling the growing political power and organization of a voting bloc that has often been taken for   by the Democratic establishment. “We are tired of being invisible,” said Del. Joseline A. Peña-Melnyk, a Prince George’s Democrat who, as chair of the House Government Operations Committee, is the highest-ranking Latino in the Maryland Legislature. “People want our vote, but when they get into office, they don’t listen,” she said at the end of the event. “We should be thought of better than ‘the people who clean your bathrooms.’” Maryland is now the  , according to the 2020 census, with Latinos representing more than 1 in 10 residents — a population   over the past decade. Even as political data researchers say they make up just a sliver of voters in the state Democratic primary, Latino voters are receiving early and concentrated attention from Senate candidates this cycle. “In a two-person race, it becomes a fight to get as close to 50 percent as you can,” said Mileah Kromer, a political scientist at Goucher College, saying that even three percent of the electorate could sway the outcome. “As the voting bloc grows, the focus on Latinos will become incredible important,” she said. According to the Democratic data analytics firm Catalist, Latino voters made up nearly 4 percent of the state Democratic primary electorate in 2020, up from 2.75 percent in 2008. Even though census data shows Hispanics make up 18.75 percent of voters, many are either not old enough to vote, ineligible because of immigration status or disinclined to participate for other reasons, according to Catalist researchers. Democrats outnumber Republicans in Maryland by a 2-to-1 margin, so the Democratic primary often determines who wins the General Election in statewide races. On Sunday, the two presumed front-runners threw so many jabs at each other, the underdog seated between them joked he should step back out of the line of fire. “I thought the rules said it was hands-off the other candidates,” Dominguez said after the event ended. “Next time I’ll come prepared.” Alsobrooks accused Trone’s business of contributing to Republican candidates who had a bad record on  ; he retorted that his record on reproductive rights is impeccable. She leaned heavily on her message that Congress needs more “people who live like and who think like the people they represent,” a jab at Trone’s multimillion dollar wealth. Trone cast Alsobrooks, who has been in public office since 2011 and a county official before that, as a “career politician” at a time when Maryland needed a change-maker who had accomplishments outside of government. Alsobrooks shot back that it was “intellectually dishonest” for a three-term congressman seeking another six years in office to denigrate her public service. Trone, meanwhile, suggested Alsobrooks lacked a substantial record on reproductive rights or on helping the Latino community when she represented them. And he hit a point that has raised much ire from Latinos in Prince George’s over the years: During her first term, zero of the 39 cabinet positions in her administration were occupied by Latinos, even though they make up about 20 percent of the county’s population. (An Alsobrooks spokeswoman noted after the event that  .) Trone has already used his deep campaign chest to woo Hispanic voters, releasing his   last week and in October hosting events for his Latino Advisory Board. Trone’s ad focused on economic issues, detailing Trone’s rise from the son of a farmer who lost the land to the bank and benefits he extended to workers in his own business. Both Trone and Dominguez have Spanish-language campaign websites. Before Montgomery County Council member Will Jawando (D)   in October, he did too. Alsobrooks, whom Jawando endorsed along with a lot of heavy-hitters in Maryland’s political establishment, has a website only in English. Trone, the founder of the national liquor retailer Total Wine & More, has poured cash into the early stages of the race, but there’s a dearth of public polling about where the candidates stand. Trone has aired multiple television ads so far and sent mailers statewide. He had spent $9.7 million by Sept. 30, compared to Alsobrooks’s $1.15 million, according to  . (At that time, Dominguez’s campaign had launch 25 days earlier and spent $210,000.)",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/03/maryland-senate-race-latinos/,Washington Post,2023-12-03 22:27:00,

No one should have believed for one second that Aaron Rodgers was going to return to the field for the New York Jets this season. Rodgers   on the fourth snap of the Jets season, the kind of injury that is automatically season-ending. This came at the end of most hyped offseason since LeBron James was holding news conferences in Miami. It wasn’t just that Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers   to an acrimonious divorce; it was the fact that Rodgers ended up with New York’s other NFL team. The Jets won their only Super Bowl in 1969 and   for most of the past 55 years. During that time, the Giants have won four Super Bowls, maintaining a certain dignity even in years — such as this one — when they aren’t very good. Giants fans talk about Phil Simms and Eli Manning; Jets fans try not to talk about Mark Sanchez and  . But with Rodgers in town and the Giants coming off a playoff season, New York sports radio show hosts spent the summer shouting at each other — and I do mean shouting — about which team would go further in the playoffs. And Rodgers, who it turns out is an attention addict, embraced the adoration. At his introductory news conference, Rodgers commented that the Super Bowl III trophy in Jets headquarters was   It wasn’t quite on the level of Joe Namath’s “guarantee,” but it certainly got the notice of all of football and sent Jets fans into paroxysms of anticipation. He then made himself   which followed the Jets throughout the exhibition season, patiently (and frequently) answering questions and talking often about how he had taken failed starter Zach Wilson under his wing in a big brother-little brother relationship. When the Jets beat the Giants in their annual exhibition game, Rodgers made a point of   as “JetLife Stadium.” When he was the last Jets player introduced on opening night — which fell on Sept. 11 — he ran onto the field carrying a small American flag. Talk about great theater. And then it was over, four snaps into the game. Anyone who has been a Jets fan (like me) for more than 15 minutes knew instantly the injury was season-ending. When a Jets fan thinks he sees a light at the end of the tunnel, it is always a train. Wilson came in for Rodgers and somehow played well enough for the Jets to escape with   win over the Buffalo Bills. Little else went right. The Jets were still good enough on defense to compete, but the man who was supposed to be the difference-maker was on crutches. But Rodgers couldn’t just work on his rehab and stay in the background. He still had to do his weekly appearance with Pat McAfee (who should tithe about 50 percent of   to Rodgers), and he nearly always said something that sent the internet buzzing. Then he started showing up on the sideline throwing passes, creating speculation that he might come back this season. Rather than duck those rumors,  . It would depend, he said, on the Jets’ playoff chances and  . A friend of mine, like me a lifelong fan, texted me and said, “if he can come back in December we can still make the playoffs!” I wrote back and said, “he’s not coming back. This is all about attention.” Which it still is, to this moment. The Jets, who are now  , stayed on the fringes for a while. Wilson’s play went rapidly downhill, and Coach Robert Saleh finally benched him in favor of Tim Boyle —   — and then Trevor Siemian. This week, Rodgers   because he had to be to continue practicing with the team. At the same time, Rodgers made clear (finally) he wouldn’t play this season, although he said he   want to play two more years instead of one. Seriously? He has taken four snaps in New York and he’s talking about playing in 2025 at age 41 and even 42? Of course, the comment made headlines and became a major radio and TV subject. Which was exactly what Rodgers wanted. I spent an hour with Rodgers once six years ago, asking him to be part of the book I was writing on playing quarterback in the NFL. He was smart, patient and funny. He asked all the right questions — and I thought I gave all the right answers. I honestly thought he was going to do it. Then I never heard from him again. I was disappointed but understood; he wasn’t the only star quarterback who turned me down. In fact, none of the others who said no were even willing to meet with me. Rodgers was. I continued to enjoy watching him play, and, like every Jets fan, was cautiously fired up about him playing quarterback in “JetLife Stadium.” I even fought my way through all the ESPN pregame hype so I could watch on opening night. The season was over in four plays. But the hype never stopped — not even for a minute. Rodgers didn’t get 15 minutes of fame as a Jets quarterback.

NASHVILLE — Longtime manager Jim Leyland was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday in a nostalgic start to MLB’s winter meetings. Leyland is a legend of his craft, a firebrand with a propensity for tirades and one of the winningest managers of the past 50 years not already in the Hall of Fame. Lou Piniella, who fell short by one vote again this year, is the 17th-winningest manager in MLB history with 1,835 wins for five teams and one World Series title. Leyland ranks 18th with 1,769 wins for four teams and a World Series title of his own. Of the 16 managers with more wins than Piniella and Leyland, 12 are in the Hall of Fame — and three (Dusty Baker, Bruce Bochy and Terry Francona) are not yet eligible. Leyland was elected by a 16-member panel of industry staples known as  , which meets every three years. Each panelist was allowed to vote for three candidates who made most of their contributions to baseball after 1980. Beyond Piniella, former Washington Nationals manager Davey Johnson, 1983 Baltimore Orioles architect Hank Peters, ex-manager Cito Gaston, former executive Bill White and ex-umpires Ed Montague and Joe West were also under consideration. The Hall of Fame formed these committees to give consideration to players no longer eligible for election on the baseball writers’ ballots and to managers, executives and umpires whose résumés warrant Cooperstown consideration. This year’s committee included Hall of Famers Jeff Bagwell, Tom Glavine, Chipper Jones, Ted Simmons, Jim Thome, Joe Torre and Bud Selig; former and current executives Sandy Alderson, Bill DeWitt, Michael Hill, Ken Kendrick, Andy MacPhail and Phyllis Merhige; and media members Sean Forman, Jack O’Connell and Jesus Ortiz. Leyland received 15 of 16 votes. The 78-year-old’s major league managerial career began with Pittsburgh in 1986 after he spent four seasons as the third base coach for another Hall of Fame manager, Tony La Russa, with the Chicago White Sox. He managed the Pirates for 11 seasons that included the early years of Barry Bonds’s career and ended with a last-place finish in 1996. He left for the still-nascent Florida Marlins in 1997 and led them to a World Series title in his first season. He spent two seasons in Miami and one with Colorado before finding another long-term home with the team that signed him as a player, the Detroit Tigers. He managed Detroit from 2006 to 2013 and made two World Series appearances, losing to the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006 and the San Francisco Giants in 2012. Piniella missed election by one vote for the second straight time. He spent 18 seasons as a player before transferring to the dugout. Those 18 seasons, which spanned four teams and included 11 years with the New York Yankees, were impressive, if not Cooperstown-worthy. He finished with a .291 batting average and more than 1,700 hits. He was the 1969 American League rookie of the year with Kansas City and made one all-star appearance, in 1972 with the Royals. His managerial career started the same year as Leyland’s, 1986, when he led the Yankees under George Steinbrenner. He managed them for two years, moved to general manager, then slid back into the dugout after one of Billy Martin’s firings in 1988. After three years in Cincinnati that included a World Series title in 1990, Piniella landed in Seattle, where he led stars Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez and Alex Rodriguez through one of the most memorable eras in Mariners history. Later, he led the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for three years and the Chicago Cubs for nearly four; he retired in 2010. West, who umpired more MLB games than anyone else (5,460), and Johnson each received fewer than five votes.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/03/jim-leyland-hall-of-fame-manager/,Washington Post,2023-12-03 20:49:00,
"Mayor Muriel E. Bowser on Monday declared a public emergency over the opioid crisis,   who say substance abuse should command more attention from the District government as overdose deaths rise. The order, which is effective immediately, directs city agencies to use a shared overdose-tracking system so outreach teams can respond to hot spots more effectively, and it suspends some contracting rules to more quickly provide services. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser on Monday declared a public emergency over the opioid crisis,   who say substance abuse should command more attention from the District government as overdose deaths rise. The order, which is effective immediately, directs city agencies to use a shared overdose-tracking system so outreach teams can respond to hot spots more effectively, and it suspends some contracting rules to more quickly provide services. Public scrutiny has increased on the District’s strategies to combat serious substance abuse, which city officials say tax hospital emergency departments, the criminal justice system and law enforcement. Opioid overdose deaths recorded by the city so far this year are on pace to surpass last year’s record of 461. “We have too many people dying in our city related to fentanyl overdoses most specifically,” Bowser said during a news conference focused on health emergencies for opioids as well as juvenile crime. The D.C. Council passed a nonbinding resolution last week urging Bowser to declare the public health emergency, which the mayor said she would consider if the order would allow concrete changes to alleviate suffering in the District. On Monday, she said the order’s terms could jump-start work of the  which must recommend how the city should spend an anticipated $80 million from an opioid lawsuit settlement. “We believe that the contracting vehicle will allow us to move — we hope — more quickly,” she said, adding that the faster the commission prioritizes investments, the sooner the order can be invoked. But some advocates questioned the scope and effectiveness of the emergency order, which is effective for at least 15 days and does not come with funding or on-the-ground services, such as housing, transportation and employment opportunities. Some said they would like to see District officials go further, adopting strategies such as treatment on demand with no waiting period, overdose prevention centers and drug-checking equipment beyond fentanyl test strips. “The most important thing is these types of declarations need to come with funding and services that could be immediately stood up. If we say it’s a crisis, we need to respond as if it’s a crisis,” said Emily Kaltenbach, senior director of state advocacy and criminal legal reform at the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for decriminalizing drug use. “We need to think beyond the strategies that may have seemed realistic five years ago.” The District joins at least six states in declaring an emergency because of the opioid crisis, including Virginia and Maryland, which made the move in 2016 and 2017, respectively,   Network for Public Health Law. Ciana Creighton, the District’s interim deputy mayor for health and human services, said during the news conference that opioid use is a driving cause of a   recorded in the United States for the first time in a century. In D.C., older Black men in Wards 5, 7 and 8 were hit hardest as fentanyl surged into the drug supply, according to city data. Last year, about a third of people who died from an opioid overdose in the District had a history of seeking treatment, city data show. Connecting residents to treatment is one goal of the District’s  , which since opening two weeks ago has served 139 people, about two-thirds of whom were transported by fire and emergency services personnel, said Robert Holman, the medical director of DC Fire and EMS. More than 60 percent were using alcohol and more than 20 percent opioids, he said, noting that the overdose antidote naloxone has been administered at the center. “You don’t take people that need to sleep and put them under bright lights and give them lots of noise; you put them in a quiet space,” Holman said. “And that’s going to help them connect because they’re not so irritated with really mission-driven specialized-care providers, and that’s key.” Opioid overdose deaths more than doubled in the five years since 2018 when the Bowser administration announced  a strategic plan intended to prevent and treat overdoses with harm-reduction techniques such as naloxone and fentanyl test strips. The forthcoming third version of the plan is under review by the mayor’s office, but some members of the Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission say the District must rethink its approach with a focus on peer support and direct services, such as housing. At a meeting last week, Edwin C. Chapman, a physician specializing in addiction medicine, pressed fellow commissioners to say if they considered opioid use an emergency in the District, eliciting abstentions from agency heads who work for Bowser. “There are people at the table who are muzzled,” Chapman said during the meeting. “They won’t say what needs to be said. If I don’t raise hell about this every day, then I should throw my license away. I’m out on Benning Road for a reason.” D.C. Council member Christina Henderson (I-At Large), chair of the council’s health committee, called the order a “good first step” that will be helpful when the commission, of which she is a member, begins to make funding decisions. The data-sharing piece is intended to reveal in real time places where the District can deploy outreach teams. However, Henderson said, council hearings on the issue show the need for a coordinated action plan. Health Alliance Network founder Ambrose Lane Jr., who has clamored for a public health emergency since an April news conference outside the District government building, had hoped such an order would allocate $50 million for infrastructure, create residential and youth treatment centers, and identify 500 jobs for people in recovery. Still, he hoped to thank Bowser after the announcement, saying, “It’s a start.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/13/dc-opioid-emergency-bowser/,Washington Post,2023-11-13 19:07:00,

Ron Rivera’s squad can’t possibly allow 45 points in a lopsided defeat this coming weekend because there’s no one on the schedule.

After Washington’s sixth loss in its past seven games, the Commanders — and their fans — get a break. Ron Rivera’s squad can’t possibly allow 45 points in a lopsided defeat this coming weekend because there’s no one on the schedule. Washington enters the bye after 13 mostly miserable weeks allowing an NFL-worst 30.4 points per game. The franchise has clinched its  since its last Super Bowl title and its fourth straight under Rivera. On the plus side, the Commanders would pick   if the season ended today. On first and 10 from the Washington 38 late in the first quarter, Sam Howell attempted a quick throw to Jahan Dotson at the line of scrimmage. One problem: Dolphins linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel, who was completely unblocked, stepped directly in Howell’s throwing lane, snatched the ball out of the air and returned it for a touchdown. It was a familiar sight for Howell, who has thrown four pick-sixes this year, including one in each of the past three games. Washington’s single-season franchise record for interceptions returned by the opposition for scores is five by Joe Gibbs’s 1990 team, which finished 10-6. Stan Humphries and Jeff Rutledge combined to throw a pick-six in three consecutive games that year, including one in the  at Philadelphia on “Monday Night Football.” According to Stathead, the NFL record for pick-sixes thrown in a season is eight by the 2004 Dolphins, who were quarterbacked by A.J. Feeley, Jay Fiedler and Sage Rosenfels. ""HE THREW IT RIGHT TO VAN GINKEL!""  📺: FOX  The rookie defensive end out of Clemson, who had 1.5 sacks in Washington’s loss to the Giants two weeks ago, burst through the line to tackle Dolphins rookie running back De’Von Achane for a loss of seven yards in the first quarter. It was a rare highlight for Washington’s struggling defense before the floodgates opened and led to Miami’s only punt of the first half. .  making his presence known 😤 📺  : FOX  The Dolphins improved to 9-3 for the first time since 2001 after scoring 31 points in the first half, which was the franchise’s most through two quarters in a road game since Dec. 7, 1986. Dan Marino threw three first-half touchdown passes that day as the Dolphins built a 31-10 lead, and they held on to defeat the Saints,  . Tyreek Hill became the first Miami receiver with multiple touchdown catches of at least 60 yards in a game since Paul Warfield had scoring grabs of 12, 86 and 60 yards in a   on Nov. 14, 1971. Hill finished with five catches for 157 yards, 152 of which came in the Dolphins’ dominating first half. One of these years, the Commanders will be the team having fun in the end zone. For the second straight week, Washington’s opponent punctuated a touchdown with an elaborate celebration. After his 78-yard touchdown catch on Miami’s first possession, Hill took a seat on the FedEx Field turf and raised his right hand. Teammates Braxton Berrios, Raheem Mostert, Cedrick Wilson and River Cracraft sat in a row behind him, right hands in the air, before Miami offensive lineman Robert Hunt made his way down the line and forcefully lowered each of their arms as an amusement-park ride operator would a safety bar. Wide receiver Jaylen Waddle then proceeded to direct a thrilling roller-coaster ride. Dolphins with the Goated TD celebration! 🎢  It was understandable when Rivera opted to punt rather than go for it after Howell threw incomplete on third and eight from the Miami 45-yard line on the first drive of the game. It was laughable when Rivera opted to try a 53-yard field goal rather than go for it when the Commanders, who were trailing by 23 points, faced fourth and eight from the Miami 35 early in the fourth quarter. Tress Way did well to handle Camaron Cheeseman’s high snap, but Joey Slye pushed the ensuing kick, which would have made a three-score game a — let me check the numbers — , wide right. The Commanders claim they have sold out every home game this season. That’s great. On a misty Sunday, the team could thank everyone who showed up in teal and orange. “As we were warming up and as we came out, on our sideline there was just a lot of Dolphins fans. I can’t remember an away game where we’ve had that much support, that much love from our fans,” Miami quarterback   after throwing for 280 yards and two touchdowns in three quarters of work. “None of that goes unnoticed, and we really appreciate that as players.” Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin was held without a catch for only the second time in his five-year career, which is concerning. McLaurin, who had 77 catches in each of the previous two seasons, is on pace for 78 grabs but only 908 receiving yards this season, which would be the fewest of his career. “Nah, I ran a lot of cardio,” McLaurin, who was targeted three times Sunday, said   about his lack of involvement in the offense. “It happens. It comes with it when it’s tough. Yeah, it’s frustrating, but I’m going to keep coming in and practicing and playing hard.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/commanders-dolphins-highlights-and-lowlights/,Washington Post,2023-12-04 09:32:00,

"With a minute left in Osbourn Park’s 59-48 win at No. 16 Centreville on Thursday, Yellow Jackets Coach Chrissy Kelly sent out her closing lineup, pursed her lips, then exhaled. The contingent didn’t look much like the senior-heavy groups that had delivered the Yellow Jackets to four consecutive state tournaments.

The contingent didn’t look much like the senior-heavy groups that had delivered the Yellow Jackets to four consecutive state tournaments. This five included four sophomores and one freshman, Payton Walters, who led all scorers with 22 points — but it sported a similar defensive identity, poking the ball away on Centreville’s final three possessions to finish an 11-point second-half comeback in Clifton. It was enough to get a subtle fist pump from Kelly as her players hugged just a few feet away. “I’m proud. They decided to win; that wasn’t me,” Kelly said. “We’re young. We’re not a very good defensive team yet, but we’re working on it. For 16 minutes, they played the best defense they could. We got one defensive possession at a time.” Kelly’s proven formula for sustained success is a senior-driven group that loves to practice, accepts tough coaching and strives to raise its standard each day. This season, with a roster that includes 11 underclassmen, she has had to adjust. “We’re young, so a lot of people doubted us,” said sophomore Samia Snead, who finished with 16 points. “But that’s motivation.” The Yellow Jackets have gotten off to a 6-2 start, but Centreville represented a different kind of test. The Wildcats (8-2), a decade removed from their last district title but replete with senior talent, had been labeled as Class 6 favorites. The hosts started strong. They attacked the glass with purpose, were decisive and efficient in transition and were intentional at getting to the paint and drawing contact. The Wildcats opened a nine-point first-quarter lead and, heeding Coach Jo McLane’s call to keep attacking, led 33-24 at half. “Kelly wrote six things that we needed to do in this game, and at half, she said we hadn’t done any,” Snead said. The Yellow Jackets got the message, turning up the defensive intensity and reducing Centreville’s attack, a battering ram in the first half, to clutter. They pressed the length of the court. On offense, Osbourn Park was quick and decisive. With five second-half three-pointers, the Jackets led 45-43 after the third quarter and allowed just five points in the final quarter. “The first half, we looked horrible,” Walters said. “We just played with effort and energy, boxed out, got rebounds and pulled it out.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/21/centreville-osbourn-park-girls-basketball/,Washington Post,2023-12-21 23:09:00,
"Virginia Del. Michelle Maldonado (D-Manassas) announced on Wednesday her bid for the state’s 10th Congressional District seat, joining a field of at least a dozen candidates vying for a chance to succeed Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.). Maldonado was reelected this month to a second term in the House of Delegates, where she launched a bipartisan technology and innovation caucus and championed legislation geared toward gender, racial and social equity. Virginia Del. Michelle Maldonado (D-Manassas) announced on Wednesday her bid for the state’s 10th Congressional District seat, joining a field of at least a dozen candidates vying for a chance to succeed Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.). Maldonado was reelected this month to a second term in the House of Delegates, where she launched a bipartisan technology and innovation caucus and championed legislation geared toward gender, racial and social equity. “I am very much like a lot of people who live here who have experienced hardships and who have accomplished things,” said Maldonado, 54, who spent part of her childhood living in a trailer outside Houston, then became a technology industry attorney in Northern Virginia and the founder of a leadership development firm that focuses on trauma recovery. “When we think about the geographic nuances and differences of people who live across CD10, I’ve experienced, directly, many of those,” she said. The race to succeed Wexton, who is   due to health reasons, has become increasingly crowded. So far, at least 10 Democrats — including Maldonado — and two Republicans have announced their candidacies, according to the nonprofit  . Maldonado says she plans to distinguish herself from her competitors by emphasizing her professional experience and her personal background as the granddaughter of Cape Verdean immigrants who grew up speaking Portuguese and is now fluent in Spanish. Her two decades as a corporate attorney in the technology industry, Maldonado said, make her a good arbiter of the federal issues surrounding the explosive growth of that sector in the congressional district, which is primarily anchored in Loudoun County and stretches into Fairfax, Prince William, Fauquier and Rappahannock counties. As the founder of a company that helps organizations overcome traumatic events, Maldonado said, she is able to bring diverse groups together around common goals — a skill, she said, that has been lacking in Congress. “We have lost the ability to work with one another effectively across the aisle with civility, respect, dignity and recognizing the humanity of across the aisle,” she said. As a state delegate, Maldonado has sought to strike a bipartisan tone in the House chamber controlled by Republicans during the past two years while championing issues related to equity. The technology and innovation caucus she founded has, among other things, explored the potential pitfalls of using artificial intelligence in government and how surveillance technology used by police departments affects privacy. Earlier this year, Maldonado sponsored a law that requires landlords to advise tenants of pending rent increases at least 60 days before the end of their lease. Other legislation she sponsored includes an unsuccessful bill prohibiting prospective employers from seeking the history of wages earned by a potential hire. If elected to Congress, Maldonado said she plans to focus on workforce development, health issues affecting women — particularly Black women — and on federal funding for school systems that would be geared toward raising teachers’ salaries and renovating aging facilities. She also plans to advocate for stronger gun safety laws, women’s reproductive rights and legislation targeting the warming climate. Those battles would be informed by her life experiences as a woman of color who has lived in both rural and urban communities, Maldonado said, noting that the 10th District has become increasingly diverse. “I think it’s really important for representatives to have a certain level of cultural understanding of their district,” she said. “It’s not just the culture of ethnicity but it’s also the culture of tradition, whether it’s our farming community or urban or exurban community.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/29/virginia-10th-district-michelle-maldonado/,Washington Post,2023-11-29 07:00:00,
"The comeback came with a serenade. A fitting, if not a bit overly literal, song titled “Get Back” by a Memphis rapper accompanied the NBA’s most compelling highlight of the week: the moment when Ja Morant reminded everyone what we’ve been missing this past month and a half. The rapper, or perhaps his social media team, posted the highlight of Morant along with the trap beat intro of his track. And as Morant, the motor and moxie behind the Memphis Grizzlies, dribbles, then accelerates and finally, in sweet, savory slow motion, spins around a defender and toward the game-winning bucket, the lyrics repeat: “That get back a [word not suitable for virgin ears].” The comeback came with a serenade. A fitting, if not a bit overly literal, song titled “Get Back” by a Memphis rapper accompanied the NBA’s most compelling highlight of the week: the moment when Ja Morant reminded everyone what we’ve been missing this past month and a half. The rapper, or perhaps his social media team, posted the highlight of Morant along with the trap beat intro of his track. And as Morant, the motor and moxie behind the Memphis Grizzlies, dribbles, then accelerates and finally, in sweet, savory slow motion, spins around a defender and toward the game-winning bucket, the lyrics repeat: “That get back a [word not suitable for virgin ears].” Morant’s back — as declared by the song, by   as time expired in his first game   and by his own mouth. After the buzzer sounded, Morant said “I’m back!” toward his father, Tee, who was dutifully fulfilling the role as Ja’s biggest cheerleader. Then, as he scanned the faces along the baseline, Morant did not break eye contact with a stunned New Orleans crowd that had earlier greeted his every dribble with boos. He didn’t lower his head. He didn’t pretend to be the humbled penitent. As the author of this moment, Morant seemed to understand the appetite we have for a good comeback script, that any mistake can be forgotten and anyone can be forgiven as long as we get a good recovery to root for and stand behind. And if that chosen protagonist possesses the non-fungible value of being a supreme athlete, then all the better. Mere mortals who return to their work after being suspended for wrongdoing would have to wait an unspecified time to win back appeal. Morant, however, won the people back in one day. Our favorite athletes have that benefit. And so, it took no time for the “Get Back” video to circulate and serve as only a taste of the exuberance from NBA players, fans and even Morant himself in welcoming Ja back to center stage. Morant and his own decisions —   — forced him to leave the spotlight and temporarily abdicate any claim as the next face of the league. Still, that tiny detail didn’t matter once Morant returned to the court and looked just like the ascendant superstar he was before he discovered  . Even though Morant hadn’t played since the Grizzlies’ first-round playoff exit last season, his conditioning was remarkable while scoring 34 points in 35 minutes. He played with pop and the fearlessness that has captivated NBA fans since his 2019 arrival as the No. 2 draft pick. The contrast between Morant and the Pelicans’ Zion Williamson, the top pick of that draft, was never more evident. Williamson showed a few explosive moments in catching lobs but rarely finished at the rim while working to get his own shot, appearing as though  was the player trying to catch his wind after sitting out the first 25 games of the year. Morant showed some fatigue, but it didn’t slow him down when the game moved to its crescendo. Just as suddenly, the reactions poured in as the ball landed through the net. The National Basketball Players Association retweeted several of Morant’s peers in the league. “JA back,” Utah’s Jordan Clarkson  , while Philadelphia’s Tyrese Maxey  , “Ja being back is good for hoops!” Even before Bill Simmons, media personality and known Boston Celtics fan, spent the rest of the evening lamenting the ways his favorite team lost, he   that Morant’s return was “a great basketball moment right there.” Morant didn’t end it there. Other than the fans who come for the magic he creates, Morant also has attracted a demographic that loves him for his swagger. He adorns his game with it. So when Morant rushed off the floor, he seasoned his strut with his on-brand hubris — an accepted arrogance because he’s so good. “I’ve kept receipts, too!” Morant blared, the declaration meaning that he has catalogued the criticism from his suspension. For his redemption story, Morant, 24, let it be known that he will be authentically himself. Not everyone has to openly articulate the depths of their emotions after experiencing the joy of returning to the mountaintop, although that works, too. After throwing the game-winning touchdown pass on “Monday Night Football,” Seattle Seahawks backup quarterback Drew Lock beamed during his interview with sideline reporter Lisa Salters. Lock was a second-round pick out of Missouri the same year Morant came out of Murray State, but he peaked as a starter during the 2020 season. Since then, he has appeared in 10 games as a second-stringer. Lock had short notice before the MNF game, but he became the unlikely hero, throwing a touchdown pass with 28 seconds remaining. “It’s so hard. It’s so hard to describe the feeling of not playing for so long, or what at least feels like a really long time for me,”   “And then you sit there and you watch games, you wonder: ‘Can I do this still?

"NEW YORK — Chelsea Gray emerged from a Barclays Center tunnel Tuesday afternoon gliding on a scooter, her injured left foot in a medical boot, confirming what was feared 48 hours earlier. The Las Vegas Aces point guard will miss Game 4 of the WNBA Finals on Wednesday and may be done for the series. NEW YORK — Chelsea Gray emerged from a Barclays Center tunnel Tuesday afternoon gliding on a scooter, her injured left foot in a medical boot, confirming what was feared 48 hours earlier. The Las Vegas Aces point guard will miss Game 4 of the WNBA Finals on Wednesday and may be done for the series. The unfortunate development wasn’t a surprise after she left   in the fourth quarter and was seen on crutches after the game. Video showed her in the hallways outside the locker room unable to put any weight on the foot, hobbling in pain. What was a surprise was Aces center Kiah Stokes coming out of that same tunnel before Tuesday’s practice in a boot of her own, moving along on crutches. Aces Coach Becky Hammon announced that Gray and Stokes will miss Game 4, when Las Vegas will have a second chance to clinch its second consecutive championship, with decisions still to be made if the New York Liberty forces a winner-take-all Game 5 to be played Friday in Las Vegas. Gray said her injury was painful and called it “not good.” “It’s brutal,” Aces guard Kelsey Plum said. “You watch them work so hard and get to this point, and you want it for them. So when they go down, it hurts. And there’s no replacing either of them. There’s no magic wand you can wave. There’s just not, and I would be ignorant to tell you that there is. It hurts, absolutely.” The somber situation was not accompanied by a somber mood Tuesday. Hammon smiled and joked about having guard Sydney Colson prepared to climb on Liberty center Jonquel Jones’s back as a defensive strategy. She even made a sly remark about possibly bringing back forward Candace Parker, who had surgery on her fractured left foot in July. Gray rolled back and forth on the scooter with a small speaker playing music, holding it up to her shoulder like a boombox during team stretches as if nothing were wrong. The Aces practiced with just eight players after canceling their scheduled session Monday. Regular starters A’ja Wilson, Jackie Young and Plum wore black shirts, while typical reserves Kierstan Bell, Alaina Coates and Colson sported white jerseys. Forward Alysha Clark and center-forward Cayla George were in black shirts, an indication of what the starting lineup could look like. “This team has responded all year,” Plum said. “We’ve been through a lot. We’ve been hurt, sued, arrested; you name it, we’ve done it. I’m confident in our group, and we’ve gone through a lot of adversity. We’ll be ready.” Wilson added: “That’s the head of our snake. That’s our leader. So that’s a challenge, obviously. … This is something that we’re just going to grind out like we’ve always been. And we’re used to being in the trenches, so at this point, we’ve just got to climb our way out.” Hammon and the Aces insisted not much would change and that they’re simply taking a next-player-up approach, but there’s no denying they will look different without Gray, the 2022 Finals MVP. The five-time all-star and two-time champion is nicknamed “Point Gawd” for a reason. She runs the offense as well as any guard in the league, dictating pace, setting up teammates and getting to her own spots almost at will. The Liberty switched league MVP Breanna Stewart onto Gray for Game 3 with the hope that the additional length would slow her down. Gray was held to 11 points, three rebounds and two assists before leaving New York’s 87-73 victory. Plum may have to make one of the biggest adjustments, playing with the ball in her hands more and shouldering additional facilitating responsibilities, but she downplayed that notion. “Play basketball,” Plum said of her approach for Game 4. “Shoot when you’re open; pass when you’re not. I feel like you’ve got to keep it simple. If you overcomplicate it at this part, for me, I play more on instinct. And so that’s what I’m going to continue to do. I don’t think my role changes as much as everyone thinks it does.” Gray added: “What actually is a positive thing about that is that our system is so fluid that any given person at any given time can be at the top and a different person can be in the corner. So you’re going to see a lot more times where Jackie and KP are at the top since I’m not out there. So our system being fluid actually really helps in that way.” Stokes said there wasn’t a specific moment when she felt her foot was injured. The 6-foot-3 center said everything hurts at this point of the season, but she woke up Monday with her foot feeling even worse than usual. She is a key component of the Aces’ defense, clogging up the middle and providing rim protection alongside Wilson, who credited Stokes for helping her win a second consecutive defensive player of the year award. Gray and Stokes have played every game for the Aces this season. Stokes said she has been talking with and helping George as much as she could even before the injury — and that will continue. “Got to live with it,” Stokes said. “Staying positive, hopeful. [It] sucks at the moment, but this is whatever. We’ve got other things to focus on. “I mean, can’t change anything now, right? So why worry about things you can’t change? ... Just trying to do my part. If I can’t go on the court, then what can I do to help my teammates? Keep the energy up.” Hammon was jovial, saying her team needed to be like a “vampire.” “No emotions — just business,” Hammon said. “I love this situation. This is my whole frickin’ life. I’m actually more comfortable in this position than the other one. I am not a good front-runner. I like being the underdog. I like being underhand, undermanned, underestimated, under, under, under.” The Liberty said it spent time preparing for scenarios with Gray both in and out of the Las Vegas lineup but practiced before the Stokes injury was known. The Aces are 0-3 this season in New York, and the Liberty now seems to have the momentum after its Game 3 victory and facing a severely shorthanded Las Vegas team. Hammon has relied heavily on her starters, mostly using a rotation of six or seven players, but now those down-the-line reserves will be counted on. After Clark, Bell’s 11.8 minutes per game were the most among regular reserves during the regular season. “I’m proud of the way that we kind of came back from Game 1 and Game 2 and really responded in Game 3,” Stewart said, “and understand that we continued to keep our season alive and have to have the same play and urgency, if not more. … “We have to continue to seize the moment. We have an opportunity, and we can’t let it pass us by.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/18/chelsea-gray-kiah-stokes-injuries/,Washington Post,2023-10-18 05:30:00,
"Of the 82 teams shimmering from the  , one stands as the runaway leader in the eternal question:   The presence of Northwestern (7-5), set to play Utah (8-4) in the Las Vegas Bowl on Saturday night, is so remarkable that it upholds at least five college football adages, four of them ancient. Of the 82 teams shimmering from the  , one stands as the runaway leader in the eternal question:   The presence of Northwestern (7-5), set to play Utah (8-4) in the Las Vegas Bowl on Saturday night, is so remarkable that it upholds at least five college football adages, four of them ancient. If college football ever did get a commissioner and opted for a blanket slogan, it might go with “154 Years of Scandals” as both truthful and alluring. Reasonable minds have called the sport itself a scandal, all the way back to the first game   at the proceedings and whined, “You will come to no Christian end!” Northwestern  , when the hazing charges from former players got real, the university administration got really inept and the upcoming season got really, really doomed. With a 4-20 record in 2021 and 2022, a 17-year head coach banished shortly before the start of fall camp and a pitiable interim coach starting six months after he arrived from North Dakota State as defensive coordinator and Power Five debutant, the Wildcats set about playing their schedule. How bold. While they plodded along, it could not have hurt that their very own Big Ten neighborhood yielded   louder scandals. As Northwestern spent September going 2-3 and withstanding a 7-7 home halftime tie with Texas El Paso — it won, 38-7, whew — along came the din around the revelations that  , the spectacularly paid Michigan State coach. As Northwestern spent October reaching 4-4 while few other than next of kin noticed, along came the ear-addling clamor of the  , a saga capable of gobbling up weeks upon weeks of peek-behind-curtain national fascination. By the time Northwestern spent November reaching second and darned-near first in the Big Ten West, the players and 38-year-old interim coach David Braun had built one of the better 7-5 seasons ever known. Braun himself had gone from “pretty speechless right now” in September after a 37-34 overtime win over Minnesota to “definitely speechless this time” after a 23-15 win over Purdue in November all the way to “an exciting time to be a part of Northwestern football” on Signing Day in December. Texas A&M “won the press conference,” as the saying goes, when it hired Jimbo Fisher in 2017; now  . Clemson did not “win the press conference” when it elevated wide receivers coach Dabo Swinney in 2008; people shrugged along the early path to its two national titles and six College Football Playoff appearances. Sometimes the big splash works out. Oftentimes it doesn’t. Northwestern resorted to Braun on July 10 in part because he lacked attachment to the school; by July 27 he had spoken a classic of a quotation to reporters at Big Ten Media Days. Having assistant-coached at alma mater Winona State (Minn.), then Culver-Stockton College (Mo.), UC Davis, Northern Iowa and North Dakota State, Braun told reporters, “I’ve been out of my comfort zone at times, many times, and that’s where the growth has come.” And then: “I’ve never been this far out of my comfort zone.” If that’s what they call winning the intro news conference, it was winning it with authenticity, which feeds into … This reality has shone lately from the footballing state of Kansas, where Lance Leipold went this century from Wisconsin Whitewater to Buffalo to Kansas and Chris Klieman went from Loras College (Iowa) to Northern Iowa to North Dakota State to Kansas State. When in January 2023 Northwestern brought in Braun to coordinate the defense, one Wildcats-minded website saw “an out-of-the-box hire who has never worked at the FBS level and has no obvious connections to the Northwestern coaching staff.” When Northwestern removed the “interim” from Braun’s title in mid-November, university president Michael Schill waxed that “Dave’s values are Northwestern’s values,” even if that line did set up nicely for lampooning. It’s time for fans’ and boosters’ football snobbery to croak. It won’t, of course. In August, all forecasters for Northwestern’s football season placed the Wildcats in seventh place among the seven Big Ten West teams because all forecasters had common sense. Here’s a sampling: “Three or four wins would be a job well done.” … “2-10” … “more on [Braun’s] plate than Nick Saban could comfortably handle” … “2-10” … “The Wildcats are in the running for worst Power Five team in the country.” From 4-5 in early November, Northwestern stomped through Wisconsin, 24-10, in Madison; handled Purdue, 23-15, at home; and weathered Illinois, 45-43, in Champaign. Along the way, wide receiver Cam Johnson fielded an excellent question about how far-fetched the record would have seemed in July. “The way that Coach Braun walked into that first meeting and told us we were going to shock the world” actually made this seem more than plausible, he said, at least all but “the world” part given the other 190-odd countries don’t care about football. What an ideal way to start a season, so thoroughly free of expectations, and things got so heady that by now it’s tantalizing to review the Iowa game on Nov. 4 at Wrigley Field. That game did not call to mind Rembrandt or Mozart. It violated present-day ordinances about football prettiness. It wreaked scattered groans across the nation by reaching halftime at 0-0. It ended 10-7 to Iowa but only after Iowa managed a 25-yard drive in seven plays to lead 7-0, whereupon Northwestern budged 66 yards in 18 plays to reach first and goal at the 2 but didn’t score, Iowa’s noble defense standing. Yet the Wildcats did gain a 7-7 tie with 1:50 left before Iowa splurged for 37 yards on seven plays to get Drew Stevens’s winning 53-yard field goal with 14 seconds left. Sure, Northwestern had narrow wins, too, but: What if both Iowa (7-2 in the Big Ten) and Northwestern (5-4) had finished 6-3, with Northwestern having won the head-to-head? Maybe life among the 8 billion on Earth has become so disarrayed that people have evolved to function better in disarray, a possibility Spain epitomized in Sydney by   11 months after a mutiny and while shepherded by  . Northwestern had to have not only disarray but also at least a measure of dissension, what with the charges, the apparent need to dismantle grotesque rituals, the lawsuits. Well: “I can’t tell you how overwhelmed with joy I am,” Braun said one day in mid-November, soon adding: “All you have to do is look at our guys’ faces as they’re walking off the field or they’re in the locker room. This group knows they’ve found a way to do something really special.” That, the Wildcats did. Often college football, that old reprobate, has the really special lying around buried under the mess.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/23/northwestern-las-vegas-bowl/,Washington Post,2023-12-23 05:30:00,
"As the North American soccer calendar filled up in recent years with an ever-increasing number of domestic and international obligations, it became apparent that something had to give. On Friday, a century-old institution fell victim to that schedule congestion. MLS announced that its clubs will skip the U.S. Open Cup for the first time in the league’s 29-year history, with teams instead entering their affiliates from the MLS Next Pro development league. An MLS spokesperson said the decision applies only to the 2024 tournament and the league plans to reevaluate its approach to the Open Cup next season. As the North American soccer calendar filled up in recent years with an ever-increasing number of domestic and international obligations, it became apparent that something had to give. On Friday, a century-old institution fell victim to that schedule congestion. MLS announced that its clubs will skip the U.S. Open Cup for the first time in the league’s 29-year history, with teams instead entering their affiliates from the MLS Next Pro development league. An MLS spokesperson said the decision applies only to the 2024 tournament and the league plans to reevaluate its approach to the Open Cup next season. “This decision will provide emerging professional players with additional opportunities for meaningful competition,” MLS said in a statement. “The move also benefits the MLS regular season by reducing schedule congestion, freeing up to six midweek match dates.” The move comes ahead of a 2024 campaign in which all MLS teams will participate in a 34-game regular season and the Leagues Cup, an intra-league tournament that this past year grew to feature every club from MLS and Mexico’s Liga MX. A record 10 MLS teams will also participate in the Concacaf Champions Cup, a regional tournament that crowns the top club in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. And MLS recently capped the largest postseason in league history, with its playoff field growing to 18 teams and the reintroduction of best-of-three series. MLS also must work around national team obligations — most notably, next summer’s Copa América. The United States will host the prestigious South American championship, which will feature six North American teams alongside the usual 10 participants from South America (including Brazil and World Cup champion Argentina). The Open Cup typically features dozens of professional teams in a single-elimination tournament encompassing the full American soccer pyramid, from MLS to amateur circuits, in the U.S. version of England’s storied FA Cup. The tournament has been played every year since 1914, with the exception of the coronavirus-canceled 2020 and 2021 editions. The last non-MLS team to lift the trophy was the Rochester Raging Rhinos in 1999, and MLS clubs have won 25 of 26 Open Cup titles since the league was founded in 1996. D.C. United has won the Open Cup three times, most recently in 2013. The Houston Dynamo, led by former United coach Ben Olsen, defeated Inter Miami to win the 2023 crown and earn the Concacaf Champions Cup berth that came with it. MLS Commissioner Don Garber hinted at the change during his state of the league remarks last week in Columbus — before the Columbus Crew defeated Los Angeles FC in   — saying “there might be changes to our participation sometime in the future.” “I believe if we’re going to have our professional teams competing in a tournament — that is the oldest tournament of its type anywhere in the country — we all need to embrace it, from our federation to our respective leagues, and give it the profile and the support it needs,” Garber said. “If we can’t do that, then we should meet and decide that there needs to be a new plan.” MLS’s three Canadian teams — CF Montréal, Toronto FC and the Vancouver Whitecaps — are still expected to participate in the Canadian Championship. Launched in 2022, MLS Next Pro is a third-division circuit featuring reserve teams from every MLS club except for D.C. and Montréal. D.C., which last year sold its controlling stake in Loudoun United of the second-tier USL Championship, has been looking to launch an MLS Next Pro affiliate in Baltimore. D.C. United selected former Seattle Sounders defender-midfielder Ethan Dobbelaere off waivers. The 21-year-old U.S. youth international logged 19 MLS matches (six starts) after signing with the Sounders as a homegrown player in 2020.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/15/mls-us-open-cup/,Washington Post,2023-12-15 17:53:00,

A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Sydney Harrison as a council member for District 8. He represents District 9. The article has been corrected. The balance of power is shifting on the all-Democratic Prince George’s County Council, which elevated Jolene Ivey, District 5, and Sydney Harrison, District 9, to leadership on Tuesday after a term that saw a more liberal majority pull the body further left. The council voted unanimously to install Ivey as chair in an annual exchange of power, handing her the ability to set the agenda as the council enters a term its members say will be shaped by a tight county budget and increasing needs. Ivey laid out her plans moments after the vote: meeting the increasing needs of vulnerable citizens, diversifying revenue sources, focusing on “smart development,” and fully staffing public safety in an effort to lessen crime in Prince George’s. Other priorities include lessening the county’s reliance on property taxes and working in partnership with County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D), who is running for U.S. Senate, Ivey said. In prepared remarks, she reinforced how the body should work together to accomplish these goals, signaling a desire for unity after a year of division over priorities set when a more liberal majority took hold, calling itself the “people’s council.” “We are stronger together when everyone’s voice is heard. Our challenges become steppingstones for success,” Ivey said. “We will do these things together. ... Our council members unified, we can meet and exceed expectations.” Ivey’s speech was met with a standing ovation of an audience that included her husband, Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-Md.), and former state senator Victor Ramirez (D). Ivey is in her on the council, after representing the 47th District in the state House of Delegates from 2007 to 2015. She has been married to Glenn Ivey since the late 1980s, and they have five sons. Their son Julian Ivey (D) serves in the House of Delegates. The Iveys have  — local, state and federal, each representing Prince George’s County. Ivey herself frequently voted with the group of six more liberal members in 2023. The group pushed forward rent stabilization, project labor agreements and a basic-income pilot program that  Ivey succeeds Thomas Dernoga, District 1, as council chair. Ivey drew hushed murmurs in the council chamber on Tuesday after thanking District 6 council member Wala Blegay for her service as vice chair in 2023 before selecting Harrison, saying she was “in need of an experienced hand” next to her — a move that was ultimately backed by her colleagues, even after several had expressed their support for Blegay. Harrison, who preceded Blegay as vice chair, routinely takes a more moderate, fiscally reserved approach to governance and will be positioned as a strong voice as the council faces what county officials predict will be a tight budget year. Harrison often found himself at odds with the socially liberal proposals of the council this term as it pushed for project labor agreements and rent stabilization, focusing on funding sources for ambitious projects in debate that illuminated the shades of Democratic blue that exist among the all-Democratic council. All members have told The Washington Post that the budget and the limitations the county will face in 2024 are of concern. During a news conference after the gavel exchange, Ivey said Harrison’s perspective will be crucial to weathering the next year. An October report from the county’s Spending Affordability Committee estimated that the county will have to tighten its budget in the coming fiscal year in the face of dipping tax revenue and increases in mandatory spending. Analysts predict that county revenue will decrease $58 million in the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2024. Coupled with the rising costs of programs such as the  , the report projects a widening deficit if trends persist — from $183 million in the next fiscal year to $387 million in fiscal year 2030. The committee suggested that the county adopt “cost containment actions” in the current fiscal year to begin addressing the projected shortfall. “We just have to stay laser-focused on the budget, being able to pay for schools, to pay for police, the fire department, everything that takes over most of our budget,” Ivey said. “Also, we always want to take care of the most vulnerable. Sometimes all of those competing choices make our lives very difficult. But this is why we’re elected.” Striking a balance will be critical, said Harrison, noting that the cost of living and providing services is increasing and that the county must think big to meet those challenges. “What we’re trying to do also is expand our tax base in a way that’s equitable for everyone, in a way that relieves the stress from homeowners, and then also creates the opportunity where everyone puts into the pot and we move our government forward to provide the best possible services that we can,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/05/jolene-ivey-prince-georges-council/,Washington Post,2023-12-06 00:18:00,

Now, a war that has claimed the lives of more than 11,000 Gazans and erased entire families has also parted newborns from their mothers and fathers. Before the war began, the distress of new Gazan mothers deepened as the expiry date on their permits neared, hospital officials recalled. When the mothers were returning to Gaza, a hospital could simply offer them one last chance to scoop their babies from their incubators and hold them close. The mothers left in “agony,” one hospital administrator said. Most of the medical staff and Palestinian mothers interviewed for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing security concerns. In the aftermath of Oct. 7, hundreds of Palestinians from Gaza, including  , were arbitrarily detained by security forces,  . The mothers trapped in Gaza have spent weeks cowering in fear as Israeli airstrikes shake the earth and ground forces encircle the north of the enclave. Rooms that expectant parents decorated lovingly for new babies have been smashed. Clothes that infants would have worn in their earliest weeks have been lost to the rubble. With  , text messages pleading for news of the babies’ health often don’t go through; the photographs sent back don’t always download. At times, the territory has been plunged into a near-total blackout, and the updates stopped flowing altogether. Muayyed and Mahmoud were born on Aug. 3 at just 29 weeks, each weighing about 3½ pounds. By Aug. 5, the hospital told their mother, Sabrine, that it was time for her to go, staff members said. She left in tears, they said, reassured only by the hospital’s promise to help her apply for another permit as soon as possible so she could return to collect them. Israeli authorities rejected it without explanation, hospital staff said. The war began soon after that. When staff members try to phone Sabrine, the conversations are brief, if the signal holds at all. They always say that the twins are safe, that they are hers. That they will be here waiting when the skies fall silent and she will take them home. The Nablus ward was brightly lit and quiet, aside from the beeping monitors. Staff in blue gowns spoke in hushed tones. A young nurse stood watch over the twins, now out of incubators and lying quietly in their cots. Muayyed has long eyelashes. In her sleep, her lips flicker upward, like she’s smiling. “My nurses care about all of our babies, but their bond with the babies from Gaza is a special one,” said Moath, a pediatrician in charge of the ward. “We do our best to compensate for the love and care that she’s missing, but it’s not the same.” Some staff members return to the ward after work to play with the twins. They are worried about them. Without the constant attention of a parent or full-time caregiver, the babies are under-stimulated. They can’t learn to focus, or study the faces of adults gazing down at them to copy their sounds and expressions. With no end to the war in sight, hospitals are improvising. At an Israeli facility visited by The Washington Post, social workers had found volunteers to give the separated babies skin-to-skin contact. “We made the request and within a day we had a whole list of people,” one of the social workers said. They chose several women who live close by; they now come to the hospital every day. “We chose people who really knew how to care for them,” the social worker said. The Post is not providing the name or location of the hospital for the security of patients, as staff members fear reprisals from Israeli authorities. When one of the hospital’s premature babies, Saaidah, experienced serious intestinal problems, doctors got the mother’s consent to operate. They couldn’t reach her the second time it happened and had to decide whether to rely on the previous permission. “It went against all of the ethics we are trained in, but we had to save her life,” a doctor said. It was 10 days until they heard from the mother again, and she greeted the news with relief. Doctors fear what state Gazan mothers might return in, if they return at all. Of the more than 28,000 Gazans injured over the past six weeks, many are women. Even in peacetime, mothers reunited with their babies after a long separation have sometimes had difficulties bonding with them. “We had a woman who wasn’t able to return for eight months,” the hospital administrator recalled. “She barely knew her child at first; she didn’t know how to hold her.” Hanan al-Bayouk, reached by phone in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza before a communications blackout, only saw her triplets twice after they were born on Aug. 28. Thirty hours after giving birth, she said, the hospital told her that her permit had expired and that she would have to return to Gaza. She did not know the permit could be extended, she said. They were IVF children — a miracle, it had seemed — but seeing them hooked up to oxygen tubes in glass incubators had been disorienting. “I didn’t know whether to feel happy or anxious,” she said. “I was nervous; I dreamed of hugging them.” The smallest was Nour, weighing less than 3 pounds. Bayouk later secured a permit to return for their discharge. It was dated Oct. 10, four days too late. She and her husband, Fathi, had bought clothes and toys. They had prepared a room. As fighting rages around their city, she stands among the empty cribs. “I see them everywhere around me,” she said, her voice breaking. “I am afraid that I will be killed in this war, and I will not be able to see them again and I do not know who will take care of them.” “We see entire families being removed from the civil registry. What if we are the next target?” For now, Nour and her sisters lie in hospital cots, with SpongeBob SquarePants on one wall and a young boy sitting in a crescent moon on another. Bayouk’s whole family has seen the photos of the girls sleeping peacefully there. “Will we really see them?” they keep asking. In calmer moments, they sit together and talk about the party they will throw for the triplets when they come home. Not one night has passed, Bayouk said, when she hasn’t dreamed of holding her children. They will be 3 months old in a couple of weeks.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/11/17/israel-gaza-war-babies-families/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 18:03:00,
"D.C. Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large) held a long-awaited hearing examining the District’s sexual harassment policy Tuesday, weeks after Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) rolled out a new anti-sexual-harassment order and months after sexual harassment allegations against Bowser’s ex-chief of staff put the issue in the spotlight. But while the stated intent was to seek feedback and suggestions to strengthen the policy through potential legislation, the hearing was more of a forward-looking informational session about what Bowser’s new policy will do, and it avoided probing how agencies have been investigating sexual harassment complaints. D.C. Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large) held a long-awaited hearing examining the District’s sexual harassment policy Tuesday, weeks after Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) rolled out a new anti-sexual-harassment order and months after sexual harassment allegations against Bowser’s ex-chief of staff put the issue in the spotlight. But while the stated intent was to seek feedback and suggestions to strengthen the policy through potential legislation, the hearing was more of a forward-looking informational session about what Bowser’s new policy will do, and it avoided probing how agencies have been investigating sexual harassment complaints. Bonds said she hoped to gather more information about how agencies are interpreting Bowser’s new order in the hopes it could aid employees in understanding the policy. While employees were expected to testify about their experiences with or opinions about the District’s anti-sexual-harassment policy, just two did, including the executive director of the local AFSCME union representing government employees, Wayne Enoch. Employees can submit written testimony to Bonds’s committee until Nov. 26. “Having the order is great, but systematic culture change is necessary,” Enoch said, citing concerns that employees have brought to him about facing retaliation, such as through performance reviews, for making sexual harassment complaints. Without significant change, he said, “the District runs the risk of losing talented employees.” Bonds said in a statement afterward that she would consider codifying the District’s sexual harassment policies — including within the council and courts — into legislation. The hearing unfolded after Bowser   that bans relationships within a chain of command and updates the definition of sexual harassment, easing the burden on potential victims to prove they have been harassed. Bowser’s updated order followed the   lodged against John Falcicchio, her former chief of staff and deputy mayor of planning and economic development, by two women who worked in his department and were under his supervision. In the aftermath of the scandal, multiple council members, including Bonds, pledged to use their oversight authority to probe the scope of sexual harassment in District government and the workplace culture within Falcicchio’s department, and council member Kenyan R. McDuffie (I-At Large) is expected to hold a hearing on the latter issue next month. The council also voted to require an independent review of the investigations into Falcicchio — which Bowser’s new order will now mandate for any top official credibly accused of sexual harassment — and the inspector general is expected to select an outside firm for the investigation soon. “I am glad that there is finally movement on multiple fronts to address the need for the safety and dignity of D.C. government employees,” council member Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1), who wants to codify the requirement for an outside investigation in her proposed legislation, said in a statement. After investigations by the Mayor’s Office of Legal Counsel substantiated both complaints against Falcicchio in part, Bonds began surveying District agencies about sexual harassment within their ranks and compiling data on complaints. She said she found that there were 354 complaints from the time Bowser’s first sexual harassment order went into effect, in December 2017, through September 2023, with the majority involving verbal harassment. Bonds also convened a working group with agency general counsels, human resources officials and others in the Office of Human Rights to discuss needed improvements, some of which she said were part of the mayor’s updated order. Bonds hoped that agencies with higher volumes of complaints, such as D.C. Public Schools and D.C. police, would  testify Tuesday. But she said D.C. Public Schools “declined to participate” and a police representative had a scheduling conflict. A half-dozen other agencies came to testify. Asked if anything was missing from Bowser’s policy, Jed Ross, chief risk management officer for the District, who reports to Bowser, said no. Bonds also asked him if he expected an uptick in sexual harassment settlements under the new policy, to which he also said no, noting that it’s largely a continuation of the 2017 policy. “I believe the policy is extremely thorough,” Ross said. “I think the mayor is leading in ensuring we take this very seriously as a government body.” Bonds searched for some potential areas of improvement, but agency representatives didn’t propose any changes. In an interview with The Washington Post last month, Bonds said that during her survey of numerous government agencies, she heard concerns about whether the District’s sexual harassment officers had adequate bandwidth. Each agency has designated officers tasked with investigating complaints, but the positions are not full-time. And Bowser’s office   that more training was needed for them after concerns about the thoroughness of some investigations. But Charles Hall, director of D.C. Human Resources, told Bonds that he did not believe there was any problem with bandwidth or resources among the sexual harassment officers. Bonds also sought to clarify several points in the order she said she hoped could be helpful to employees tuning in. She questioned whether, under the policy, a person needed to tell their alleged harasser to stop, or if Hall believed it would be helpful to have that on the record for an investigation. Hall said this was not required. “An employee may not feel safe enough at that moment to state something,” he said. “We want to make sure they understand it is not their requirement to do so” but that different reporting avenues are available to them. Bonds said one area of concern is that an employee can report alleged sexual harassment if they observed something inappropriate, even if they were not on the receiving end. “Do you think the order goes too far by saying if you say something, hear something, think something, that you can report it?” she asked. “No, I don’t think it goes too far,” Rachel Noteware, associate director of the Mayor’s Office of Legal Counsel, told Bonds. “We would rather someone report something and it turns out to be nothing, because that helps us ensure we are keeping the workplace safe for all people.” Hall noted that under the updated definition of sexual harassment in the mayor’s order, employees should also feel comfortable to report single incidents vs. a longer pattern of misbehavior. The update reflects a 2022 change in the law that broadened the definition of sexual harassment. Previously, victims had to show that the harasser engaged in “severe and pervasive” conduct. But the new order, like the law, now requires investigators to consider the totality of the circumstances, noting that no specific level of egregiousness or number of incidents is required to show that a person has been harassed. “The expanded definition means employees are empowered to report even singular or small incidents of a sexual nature,” Hall said. Bonds said she also had to make clear for the record: Does the new policy prohibit hugging? The policy gave an example of a hypothetical employee who tended to greet people with hugs — but was told that this could make people uncomfortable and that he could get in trouble if he kept doing it. “Hugs are not prohibited in the mayor’s order,” Hall said, noting that the excessive hugger was just an example.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/14/dc-hearing-sexual-harassment-policy-bonds-bowser/,Washington Post,2023-11-14 19:22:00,
"NASHVILLE — One of the most accomplished and durable young left-handed hitters in baseball history is available because the San Diego Padres need to save money and probably cannot afford to pay him when he becomes a free agent after the 2024 season. One of the more storied franchises in sports is coming off a disappointing season in a stretch of disappointing seasons defined largely by the team’s inability to balance out an oft-injured lineup that had far more right-handed power than it could secure from the left. NASHVILLE — One of the most accomplished and durable young left-handed hitters in baseball history is available because the San Diego Padres need to save money and probably cannot afford to pay him when he becomes a free agent after the 2024 season. One of the more storied franchises in sports is coming off a disappointing season in a stretch of disappointing seasons defined largely by the team’s inability to balance out an oft-injured lineup that had far more right-handed power than it could secure from the left. Juan Soto, who has proved himself capable of transforming a lineup on his own, could provide the New York Yankees with exactly what they need to make their lineup steadier and more balanced. They should not miss the chance to let him. The Yankees and Padres have been talking about a potential deal for Soto, according to reports. The Padres’ asking price — reportedly seven young players, or more people than it took the Padres to acquire   — has been too high for the Yankees. Soto is, at this point, a one-year rental. Not wanting to empty the farm system is understandable. But the Padres need affordable starting pitching for their big league roster and could use some depth in the minors, too. The Yankees have it in Clarke Schmidt, Michael King, Randy Vásquez, Jhony Brito and others. Few teams can consider starting pitching expendable, and after Luis Severino signed a free agent deal with the New York Mets, the Yankees certainly could use some depth. But they are pursuing   and have reason to bet on a bounce-back season from last year’s free agent prize, Carlos Rodón. What they do not have is a quick fix for an aging, unbalanced lineup that probably needs to be overhauled by a front office under pressure to win now. Fixes such as those are hard for any team to find, and they are particularly difficult to unearth in the Bronx, where more than one established star has faded under the scrutiny. But Soto has, in a limited sample, thrived in New York as an opponent. To the extent that it is relevant, he has a .339 average, 1.165 OPS and 11 homers in 33 career games at Citi Field, home of the Mets. And asked whether he has any concerns about his former pupil handling the pressure of New York, Nationals Manager Dave Martinez did not hesitate. “No,” he said Monday at MLB’s winter meetings as a half-dozen Yankees reporters crowded in to ask that very thing. “The first time I ever met him, I just asked him, ‘What motivates you?’ ” Martinez said. “… The first thing he says: ‘I love baseball. That’s all I want to do.’ So I think he’ll handle [New York] very well.” More importantly than all that, Soto owns a 1.219 OPS in seven career games at Yankee Stadium despite a .133 batting average on balls in play during those appearances. And crucially for the Yankees, who have not harnessed the advantages of their short right field porch in recent years, he has hit four homers in seven career appearances at Yankee Stadium — and for a player who some evaluators think has been too patient at times during his Padres career, too willing to work a walk, that short porch could provide incentive for him to be a little more aggressive. Of course, the line between trying to do too much and making the most of his once-in-a-generation eye is a fine one. But that is a problem for a later time. The more pressing hurdle for the Yankees, at least in terms of their willingness to pay what the Padres seek, is that Soto, who is represented by Scott Boras, becomes a free agent after this season. He and Boras, memorably, turned down a Nationals extension offer of  . Boras was firm then — and has been since — that Soto is a special player deserving of a bank-breaking if not record-breaking deal. So any team acquiring him for next year probably will have to confront the reality that he could depart after next season. For a team such as the Seattle Mariners, who some have suggested might be a fit for Soto after they offloaded Eugenio Suárez, Evan White, Marco Gonzales and Jarred Kelenic over the past few weeks with the stated purpose of clearing payroll, that concern would be very real. They do not know if Soto would like playing there. They have never given a contract that big before. The Toronto Blue Jays, who could use some power in the outfield, have reportedly expressed interest in Soto, too. But they are also facing the prospect of their two homegrown stars, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Bo Bichette, hitting free agency after the 2025 season. Could they pay them and Soto? Would Soto want to play for them? The Yankees have not been as free-spending in recent seasons as they used to be. And Soto, who has struggled at times defensively and seems likely to age into a designated hitter role at some point during the later years of any megadeal, would be one of many offense-first outfield/DH types on their roster. Giancarlo Stanton is under contract through at least 2027 and has such a lengthy injury history that he seems likely to need the designated hitter’s spot for the bulk of his tenure. Soto, therefore, might lock the Yankees into the same kind of roster issues — namely, a logjam of less mobile sluggers — that have plagued them in recent seasons. But they are also the Yankees, which means they have a history of spending that suggests they would be able to pay Soto long term and offer the kind of stage that might make him want to sign there long term. But more importantly, the Yankees have reason to believe that Soto could make them much better right away, addressing needs they have struggled to deal with for years now and spit them out into a memorably tense offseason that has already included one hour-long, expletive-riddled Brian Cashman rant about his team’s viability. Acquiring Soto would help them make a statement. Pairing that acquisition with that of an elite starter such as Yamamoto could help alter their trajectory and the narrative. Hitters like Soto are not available very often. The Yankees certainly have had a hard time finding one recently.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/04/yankees-juan-soto-trade-candidates/,Washington Post,2023-12-04 17:06:00,
"In a Buffalo season filled with tumult, controversy and drama, with the team’s Super Bowl window seemingly up for referendum every week, the Bills might wind up better constructed for the unique challenges of western New York football than any of their recent predecessors. They also might be more hardened for the postseason than ever before. In a Buffalo season filled with tumult, controversy and drama, with the team’s Super Bowl window seemingly up for referendum every week, the Bills might wind up better constructed for the unique challenges of western New York football than any of their recent predecessors. They also might be more hardened for the postseason than ever before. As counterintuitive as that may seem and for all the scrutiny that Coach Sean McDermott, General Manager Brandon Beane and the locker room have endured since the spring, it’s not so far-fetched that this Buffalo team could be the one to break through and reach the Super Bowl for the first time since the conclusion of the 1993 season. If the Bills can actually get to the playoffs, of course. Which is the rub of all rubs. Despite self-inflicted errors and mind-numbing defeats, defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier’s mysterious offseason departure and quarterback Josh Allen’s dismay over the  , the revelation of   years ago regarding 9/11 and the constant rumblings about wide receiver Stefon Diggs’s discontent, few teams are playing better than this bunch over the past month. After years of cruising to the AFC East title and challenging for the AFC’s top seed, these Bills (8-6) have charted a very different path that might actually steel them for the playoffs. They are far more balanced on offense, with the best offensive line of the McDermott/Beane offerings, and seem better suited to western New York winters. They also have managed to rally and coalesce in ways previously unimaginable. “If they get in, they might not lose,” said one general manager, whose team has faced many of the best teams in the NFL and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not at liberty to publicly handicap the playoffs. “No one in this conference is going to want to play them. They look like that team that’s peaking at the right time.” The Bills have seemingly done nothing the easy way, with questions about their Super Bowl window percolating even before they were   last January, ill-equipped to battle the elements of a driving snow and suffering from sideline meltdowns along the way. Things reached their nadir this season after a 12-men-on-the-field penalty fueled Denver’s  , dropping the Bills to 5-5 and prompting Dorsey’s ouster. They stood on the precipice of either implosion — validating all the predictions of impending demise — or a collective rally to salvage their season. “You find out what your team is made of in times like that,” Beane recently told me. The Bills are 3-1 since that loss, dropping   in which they outplayed the Eagles, then  . They have adopted a time-of-possession-oriented style while still racking up 29.3 points per game (third in the NFL since Week 10), transforming a bombs-away offense to now funnel through a previously nondescript, do-everything running back in James Cook. It culminated in   on Sunday in which perennial MVP candidate Allen needed barely to raise his arm to throw a pass (finishing with seven completions) in a 31-10 win and in which the Bills seemed perfectly at ease in the rain and cold. They displayed an offensive physicality not previously apparent outside of their hard-nosed quarterback, with a commitment to the run aiding a defense that has weathered major injuries and is not as statistically dominant as some of McDermott’s past units. “I didn’t do a good enough job in the past of building the roster in a way that could adapt to different types of situations,” Beane said when asked whether this roster is better built for Buffalo. “Bad weather, fast turf, slow conditions, bad turf, heavy run game, heavy pass game. This group has given the play caller more multiplicity in terms of adjusting to what type of game it is. I’ve really tried to learn from my mistakes and try to do a better job with that than I have in the past.” New offensive coordinator Joe Brady has excelled at getting Allen, Cook, power back Latavius Murray and speedster Ty Johnson involved, catering their usage to weaknesses in opposing defensive fronts. Beane   in the offseason for investing in guard Connor McGovern in free agency and using a second-round pick on another guard (O’Cyrus Torrence), but it seems to be working now, with right tackle Spencer Brown (the 93rd pick in 2021) thriving as well. “This is the best line Brandon’s put together since he’s been there,” said a high-ranking executive from a team that faced the Bills this season who is not permitted to comment on other clubs’ personnel. “I know he took a lot of [crap] for some of the moves he’s made, but they’ve become a more physical football team.” Allen needs just four passing touchdowns to join Cam Newton as the only players in NFL history with 30 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns in the same season. He can still drop back and throw for big numbers if needed, as recently evidenced against the Jets and Eagles. But the Bills are doing it all a bit differently now. They have leaned back into activating Allen’s legs on designed runs and keeping the ball in his hands in the red zone after interceptions took a toll. Cook is 32 yards from becoming Buffalo’s first 1,000-yard rusher since LeSean McCoy in 2017. Since Week 10, Cook is fourth in the NFL in scrimmage yards (141 a game) after rolling up over 200 against Dallas. The Bills were in shotgun 75 percent of the time in the first 10 weeks but have cut back to 70 percent since while embracing a more under-center rushing attack (105 such runs the first 10 games, 71 in the past four). They have ramped up their use of motion and have gone from running the ball 41.2 percent of the time under Dorsey (20th in NFL) to 51.5 percent under Brady (second). They have also gone from 25.4 rushes a game through 10 weeks (20th) to 38.8 rushes per game since (first). “They are built better for Buffalo right now. I’d agree with that,” former NFL offensive lineman and longtime analyst Brian Baldinger said. “You have to give Joe Brady a lot of credit for changing their identity. They are playing to the strengths of … McGovern and O’Cyrus and Brown. That’s a very good group up front right now.” Over the past four games, the Bills have held the ball for a staggering average of 35 minutes 50 seconds — more than a minute longer than the next-best team (Chicago)  after being middle of the pack in time of possession through 10 weeks. Their revamped high-percentage passing game has helped curtail the crushing turnovers that threatened their season; Buffalo’s giveaway rate is down significantly since the coordinator change. They are a Cook dropped sideline pass in Philadelphia from being undefeated since that Monday night loss to the Broncos. And there is reason to believe the best is still to come. Veteran tight end Dawson Knox is still adjusting in his return from a broken wrist, so the best of Buffalo’s new 12 personnel looks — pairing Knox with first-round pick Dalton Kincaid — might not have yet appeared. The Bills could still win the AFC East with a little help from the Dolphins, and their brutal schedule is subsiding, with games against the Chargers (Saturday night) and Patriots before the finale at Miami. They resisted any urge to splinter and seem better aligned with their geography than at any point since Allen’s arrival in 2018. If they can somehow manage to bring postseason football back to Buffalo, things might be very different this time around.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/22/buffalo-bills-playoffs/,Washington Post,2023-12-22 14:24:00,
"Alexandria lawmakers voted unanimously early Wednesday to eliminate single-family-only zoning in this Northern Virginia city, a functionally limited but symbolic and controversial move that opens the door for the construction of buildings with as many as four units in any residential neighborhood. The vote, which extends a hotly debated trend in urban planning to another corner of the D.C. region, was one of several zoning changes approved as part of the . Alexandria lawmakers voted unanimously early Wednesday to eliminate single-family-only zoning in this Northern Virginia city, a functionally limited but symbolic and controversial move that opens the door for the construction of buildings with as many as four units in any residential neighborhood. The vote, which extends a hotly debated trend in urban planning to another corner of the D.C. region, was one of several zoning changes approved as part of the . As housing stock in the D.C. area has failed to keep up with demand, Alexandria officials   as an effort to increase housing supply and lower costs in their mostly suburban community — specifically, by amending rules on what can be built where. But much of the public’s attention focused on one piece of the package: a set of zoning changes that will make it easier to put townhouses and small apartment buildings in neighborhoods that had long been reserved for one house with a yard on each lot. A growing number of local governments across the D.C. region and around the country have debated whether to adopt their own versions of this policy, which had divided residents over whether it would destroy their neighborhoods or make them more inclusive. “We’ve all been talking past each other on this issue,” Mayor Justin M. Wilson (D) said. “I think both sides don’t understand the fears and worldview on the other side.” Still, he said, the contested plan would lead to more housing while incorporating the necessary “guardrails” to address worries about change coming too quickly to the more suburban parts of this historic city. “Our zoning authority is a powerful tool, and it’s one that it gives us the ability to actually shape the supply of housing in our community,” he said. “These proposals are modest, but I believe they’re good and positive ones in moving the city forward.” In nearby Arlington, a similar plan for more “missing middle” housing prompted a fiery, drawn-out discussion ahead of a vote this year and is now the subject of   by 10 homeowners against the county. Alexandria’s effort was less ambitious — at its most expansive, it allows for four-unit buildings rather than six-unit buildings — and it will affect fewer neighborhoods because much of the city is already zoned to include townhouses or apartments. Yet even as the plan always seemed on track to get the green light from the city’s all-Democratic council, it drew similar kinds of debate throughout the fall.  Advocates for the policy argued that it would undo the legacy of exclusionary rules and provide less expensive housing options in some areas, although some also called on the city to go further. (The   in Alexandria was $617,500 last month, about 1½ times the national figure.) Opponents called on the city to slow the rezoning process, charging that it had not informed residents about a policy that could overwhelm city infrastructure. They also said it would increase profits for developers rather than producing affordable housing. The policy’s impact will ultimately be relatively modest. Any properties built or redeveloped under the new policy must adhere to existing standards that limit the height and footprint of single-family houses.   from Alexandria city planners, only about 66 of the city’s 9,000 single-family lots will be converted to denser housing over the next decade, adding somewhere about 150 to 178 housing units. As part of the “Zoning for Housing” plan, lawmakers voted to roll back city rules that require off-street parking at residential buildings near Metro stations or rapid bus transit stops. This change will apply to single-family-only neighborhoods such as Seminary Hill, a leafy collection of cul-de-sacs, as well as areas that are largely filled with townhouses, such as historic Old Town. City council members also voted to delete a definition of “family” from the city’s zoning code entirely. That piece of code, written more than three decades ago, said no more than four unrelated people could live in one house — a rule that zoning officials said was impossible to enforce and that lawmakers called outdated and unreasonable. (Building codes that determine the maximum number of people who can live in any given house or apartment are passed at the state level and will not be affected by the decision.) But Roy Byrd, chair of the Coalition for a Livable Alexandria — a group formed to oppose the change — said it underscored his ultimate feeling about the overall proposal. “I fear that it means that families are no longer a priority for this city,” he said. “There’s going to be a different kind of development, but it’s still going to be unaffordable and it’s going to change the character of the city.” Byrd, who owns a three-bedroom house in the Clover College Park area, said most city council members had “dismissed and disparaged” residents who opposed the proposal. They will be to blame when the plan increases Alexandria’s density and overwhelms schools, parks and recreation centers, he added. “They stirred up something that is not going away. They own it now,” Byrd said. “If it doesn’t work out, I hope that those that voted for it will stand up and say, ‘This is my fault. I take ownership.’” Marsha Rhea, a leader of the interfaith advocacy group VOICE, predicted a different result. She said the zoning change was an important step to open up the city to more people and more diverse kinds of housing — even if more still needed to be done to support the poorest residents. “I think you saw two very different visions of what Alexandria should be,” said Rhea, 69, who owns a two-bedroom townhouse in Old Town. “You had people holding on to the privileges they had acquired in the past and you had other people saying, ‘This city is growing, and we welcome that growth.’” As she looks to stay in Alexandria during her retirement and “age in place,” she hopes some of the zoning changes may lead to the development of smaller units that are more accessible than her four-story property. “This is a way forward,” she added. “If you think about it as a three-legged stool, zoning is a pretty important leg in that stool.” Other measures included in the “Zoning for Housing” package — which drew far less debate or attention — streamlined or tweaked other aspects of the city’s zoning policies in ways that Rhea and other advocates praised as more effective in creating affordable housing. In particular, the package extends   — which gives developers the right to build substantially more units in a given building than otherwise allowed — as a way to subsidize more units for the poorest renters. That has created more than 1,800 units — including over 1,000 set aside for affordable housing — in the last decade, and planners expect that it could have similar results moving forward. For all the changes to go into effect, council members must now approve an ordinance enacting them — something they are likely to do next month.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/29/alexandria-single-family-zoning-housing-vote/,Washington Post,2023-11-29 17:02:00,

Nine months ago, Scottie Hubbard was in the stands as   in the D.C. State Athletic Association Class AA championship game. He saw the Tigers — several of whom were close friends — duke it out with the rival Quakers and came away impressed. “They play fast-paced, and they let you play free,” he said. Hubbard now dons Jackson-Reed’s green-and-black uniforms as a senior transfer from St. Andrew’s. He instantly became a key cog for the potent Tigers, who built a 35-point halftime lead and never looked back in a 61-23 win over Bowie (5-2) on Saturday night at the Mid-Atlantic Basketball Classic at Bowie State. “He’s adjusted pretty well,” Jackson-Reed Coach David “Tee” Johnson said. “He’s having a lot of fun, and it’s just a great opportunity for him.” Hubbard didn’t get to see Jackson-Reed earn a program-defining state championship back in March. The Tigers were ousted by the Quakers for the third time in four seasons, a scenario described by Johnson as the “monkey on our back” — Jackson-Reed has continuously seen the state title slip out of its grasp. Enter Hubbard. A 6-foot-6 guard, he came to Jackson-Reed known for his shooting and emerged as a threat from both behind the three-point arc and around the basket for the   Tigers (10-1). “He’s tough as nails, can shoot the cover off [the ball],” Johnson said. “He’s been amazing for us.” It started at the Gonzaga D.C. Classic earlier this month, when Hubbard took a feed from senior Lucas Sekasi with less than five seconds left in a tie game against Archbishop Ryan (Pa.). Hubbard hoisted a deep three-pointer, his feet just inches from the midcourt logo, and watched it swish through the net as time expired for a 50-47 win. He then sprinted toward the Tigers’ student section before being swarmed by his new teammates. Less than a week later, Hubbard calmly nailed the game-winning free throws in a 48-46 win over Bishop McNamara. “Some of those games we shouldn’t have been in that situation, but it was just my teammates trusting me in the right moment,” he said. “It was definitely a learning experience.” Hubbard knows it’s early. Johnson does, too. The Tigers suffered their lone loss Dec. 10, falling to undefeated No. 2 Gonzaga, 55-48. They will face plenty more challenges before postseason play comes around.

"Before his team hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday night at Capital One Arena, Coach Spencer Carbery asked his Washington Capitals to keep the looming Christmas break out of mind — for just one more game. “We’ve got 60 minutes of work to put in against the best team over the last five years,” he said after the morning’s pregame skate. Before his team hosted the Tampa Bay Lightning on Saturday night at Capital One Arena, Coach Spencer Carbery asked his Washington Capitals to keep the looming Christmas break out of mind — for just one more game. “We’ve got 60 minutes of work to put in against the best team over the last five years,” he said after the morning’s pregame skate. As it faced a benchmark NHL franchise that went to three consecutive Stanley Cup finals from 2020 to 2022 and won twice, Washington brought the energy Carbery requested, particularly in the second and third periods. But the Capitals fell, 2-1, in a shootout, to end their three-game winning streak. The winning goal in the shootout came in the fourth round from Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman to close the Capitals’ fourth consecutive game that extended beyond regulation. The Capitals outshot Tampa Bay 34-20 and had the only two high-danger scoring chances in overtime, but they couldn’t beat star goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy (33 saves) more than once. What appeared to be a go-ahead goal by defenseman Nick Jensen with 11:21 left in the second period was waved off after Tampa Bay successfully challenged that the play was offside. “They’re just a really hard team to play against,” Carbery said. “In all the categories, you know why they’ve done what they’ve done and accomplished what they’ve accomplished.” Capitals goaltender Charlie Lindgren made 19 saves. On a diving play in the final seconds of overtime, he appeared to jam his right hand against the goal post. He remained on the ice for the shootout, when Brayden Point and Hedman scored for Tampa Bay. Evgeny Kuznetsov converted for Washington. Up next: the NHL’s three-day Christmas hiatus. Washington returns Wednesday at the New York Rangers. Tampa Bay (17-13-5), which has scuffled this season but beat defending champion Vegas on Thursday and is now on a three-game winning streak, grabbed the lead with 7:29 remaining in the first period when Hedman ripped a slap shot from the blue line that was tipped in by Luke Glendening. The play started with a miscommunication behind the net between Lindgren and defenseman Rasmus Sandin that allowed the Lightning to keep the puck in the offensive zone. make sure you stock up on hot hands this winter  The Capitals (17-9-5) leveled the score 2:01 into the second period on another goal from their   of Aliaksei Protas, Connor McMichael and Anthony Mantha. (They reunited Saturday as McMichael returned from a two-game absence with an illness.) Protas delivered a behind-the-back pass at the blue line to Jensen, who fired a slap shot that redirected off Mantha’s leg and past Vasilevskiy. The goal continued a run of strong play by Mantha, who scored twice in  . He has 10 goals, one off his total from last season in 40 fewer games. “I came in this year with a mentality to jump back on the train [this season],” Mantha said. “It was a hard year last year. I was focused [and] was determined to step up this year, and that’s what’s going on right now.” Despite the loss, Washington heads into the Christmas break as one of the NHL’s surprise stories.   the Capitals, with a   and a revamped roster combining young talent and aging holdovers from their Stanley Cup-winning core, would struggle to compete for a playoff berth. But more than a third of the way through the season, Washington has 39 points and is squarely in postseason contention. “I like where we’re at — I told our team that,” Carbery said. “I think we’ve done a ton of really good things. I think we’ve found ways to win games. And … I think we have another level and another gear, and that will be the challenge. It’s not going to be easy, but I really like what we’ve done. We’ve shown some ingredients of winning teams and teams that can win coming down the stretch. “Our guys should be proud of that. They should be very optimistic of what we’ll be able to accomplish in the second half.”  After the game, the Capitals announced they returned Ivan Miroshnichenko and Hendrix Lapierre to Hershey of the American Hockey League.

"As a self-described “soft-spoken, low-volume guy,” Devante Smith-Pelly never really considered a post-retirement career in media during his playing days, but the former Washington Capitals winger did some studio work for Canadian sports outlet TSN after hanging up his skates last December and enjoyed the experience.

As a self-described “soft-spoken, low-volume guy,” Devante Smith-Pelly never really considered a post-retirement career in media during his playing days, but the former Washington Capitals winger did some studio work for Canadian sports outlet TSN after hanging up his skates last December and enjoyed the experience. When the Capitals reached out to Smith-Pelly this season about filling in for radio analyst Ken Sabourin on the team’s just-ended five-game Western Conference road trip, the 2018 Stanley Cup champion and   jumped at the chance. Longtime Capitals radio play-by-play man John Walton is happy he did. “I immediately thought it was a wonderful idea,” Walton, who has called Capitals games alongside Sabourin since 2011, said in a phone interview last week. “I loved Devo from his playing days, and it seemed to make sense. He has exceeded all of my expectations with this trip.” Smith-Pelly, 31, was a studio analyst for TSN’s coverage of the world championships in May. He had been in touch with the Capitals about getting involved with the team in some capacity since his retirement, and Sabourin’s planned time off presented an opportunity. Ahead of the trip, Smith-Pelly listened to Capitals radio broadcasts to get more familiar with timing cues and the type of commentary an analyst provides during a game, and he chatted with Walton about his own preparation process. Ready to go from San Jose with ⁦ ⁩ and his ⁦ ⁩ debut tonight. 10:15 airtime back home, let’s go!  Given his TV experience, albeit limited, Smith-Pelly said he wasn’t nervous for his radio debut in the Capitals’  on Nov. 27. When longtime friend and former teammate Tom Wilson leveled Sharks defenseman Calen Addison in the first period, Smith-Pelly chimed in. “At game speed, that looked like a clean hit,” he said. “It just looked like a bigger guy getting a smaller guy, but we’re going to have to definitely take another look at that. Obviously, whenever Tom hits someone, there’s a microscope on him.” The Capitals wanted to give Smith-Pelly an immersive media experience on the road trip, so two nights later, with Washington in Los Angeles to take on the Kings, Smith-Pelly joined Joe Beninati and Craig Laughlin in the Monumental Sports Network TV broadcast booth for the start of the second period. “Craig, Joe B and John, they’ve all been helping me out,” Smith-Pelly said in a phone interview. “They’re legends, so anything I can take from them while also finding my own thing is great. Once we got through the pregame and a little bit of the first period of the first game, I was kind of off and running.” Walton said Smith-Pelly already has an excellent sense of when to get in and out of the spaces for an analyst to offer insight during a broadcast. Smith-Pelly said he got more comfortable every game on the trip. “The enthusiasm and his personality, that’s not something that happens in a day or a game or even a road trip, but I’ve been impressed with how quickly he’s been able to bring that to the show,” Walton said. “I really thought in L.A. he was finding his voice. He’s a quick study, and he’s done outstanding.” The Capitals’ next stop was Anaheim, where Smith-Pelly spent the first four years of his NHL career after the Ducks selected him 42nd in the 2010 draft. He was back   with Walton on Thursday when Wilson   in Washington’s 5-4 win. (Smith-Pelly had interviewed Wilson for Monumental Sports about playing in his 700th career game ahead of the contest.) “I don’t think it’s a coincidence that [Wilson] was my first interview and he immediately gets a hat trick,” Smith-Pelly, who lives in Toronto, said with a laugh. “I’m going to take a little bit of credit for that.” “It’s been an amazing journey … Excited for this one. Hopefully we’ll get the win.” Tom Wilson chats with special guest host Devante Smith-Pelly on tonight’s Rinkside Update previewing the former’s 700th career game.  |    Reconnecting with former teammates was one of the highlights of the trip for Smith-Pelly, who scored seven goals in the 2018 playoffs, including the tying goal in Washington’s Cup-clinching win over the Vegas Golden Knights in Game 5. Smith-Pelly went out to lunch with Alex Ovechkin and Evgeny Kuznetsov last week, and he was bummed that T.J. Oshie and Nicklas Backstrom didn’t travel because of injuries. In the  announcing his retirement, Smith-Pelly referred to his two seasons in Washington as the “most amazing experience” of his life. His presence on the broadcasts over the past week, including for Saturday’s game in Las Vegas, rekindled memories of  . “The outpouring of love on social media tells me how much he means to our fan base, to our region,” Walton said. Sabourin is due back in the radio booth as Washington returns home after Monday night’s loss at Arizona, but the Capitals have been in discussion with Smith-Pelly, who is interested in pursuing a second career in broadcasting, about future opportunities. “This won’t be the last time we do this, I guarantee you,” Walton said. “He’s too good. Kenny’s not going anywhere, but I want to find a way to incorporate [Smith-Pelly] moving forward. … The sky’s the limit for him.

"Only eight NBA franchises have had losing streaks of 20 games or more, but this year’s Detroit Pistons find themselves challenging for the longest slump ever. Detroit’s last win came Oct. 28 against the Chicago Bulls. The Pistons have lost 25 games straight and, following a 119-111 loss to the visiting Utah Jazz on Thursday, are one loss from matching the league’s longest such streak in a single season. Detroit can tie that mark on Saturday at Brooklyn, and has a chance to set a record, again against the Nets, on Tuesday. Only eight NBA franchises have had losing streaks of 20 games or more, but this year’s Detroit Pistons find themselves challenging for the longest slump ever. Detroit’s last win came Oct. 28 against the Chicago Bulls. The Pistons have lost 25 games straight and, following a 119-111 loss to the visiting Utah Jazz on Thursday, are one loss from matching the league’s longest such streak in a single season. Detroit can tie that mark on Saturday at Brooklyn, and has a chance to set a record, again against the Nets, on Tuesday. That in mind, let’s take a look at some of the longest single-season losing skids in American sports history. The 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers and the 2013-14 Philadelphia 76ers share the longest single-season losing skids in NBA history, having lost 26 consecutive games during their respective seasons. Both teams finished those campaigns with 19-63 records. In the wake of LeBron James’s offseason decision to leave Cleveland for Miami, the Cavaliers struggled early in the 2010 season. The team’s first double-digit losing run began in late November and ended with an overtime win against the New York Knicks. Immediately after that win, the Cavaliers lost 26 straight starting Dec. 20 and ending with a Feb. 11 overtime win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Philadelphia’s skid started on Jan. 31, 2014 and ran until March 27. The following year, the 76ers were hardly better, closing that season on a losing run that extended into the 2015-16 campaign. The slump lasted 28 games across two seasons, the longest in NBA history. The 1961 Philadelphia Phillies hold the record for the longest losing streak since the beginning of the Modern Era (after 1900) with 23 straight defeats. The team’s losing slide began July 29 and lasted until the second game of an Aug. 20 doubleheader. When the skid stopped, the Phillies were 42 games behind the National League leader. That victory, which came against the Milwaukee Braves, opened a four-game winning streak that was Philadelphia’s longest of that season. The team finished with a 47-107 record. The 2008-09 Detroit Lions became the first NFL team to finish the regular season with a winless record since the season was extended to 16 games in 1978. Nearly a decade later, the Cleveland Browns matched that ignominy, losing all 16 games during the 2017-18 season (the league added a 17th game to its regular season schedule in 2021). The Lions and the Browns are two of four teams to suffer through winless seasons since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were winless in their inaugural 1976 season (0-14) and the Baltimore Colts had eight losses and a tie in the strike-shortened 1982 NFL season. Look before the merger and beyond a single season, and you’ll find the Chicago Cardinals, who lost 29 consecutive games from 1942 through 1945. The 1976-77 Buccaneers own the longest losing streak since the merger (26 consecutive defeats). The 2003-04 Pittsburgh Penguins and 2020-21 Buffalo Sabres share the record for the longest losing streak in a season at 18 games. Pittsburgh, under coach Eddie Olczyk and team captain Mario Lemieux, finished at the bottom of the Eastern Conference with a 23-47-8 record. The Penguins’ slide began around the midway point of that season, lasting from Jan. 13, 2004 until its Feb. 25 overtime win against the Phoenix Coyotes. The Sabres could not prevent their own 18-game skid during the abridged 2020-21 season, which was shortened because of the pandemic and began in January 2021. They won six games before the losing streak, which ran from mid-February to the end of March, concluding with a March 31 win over Philadelphia. Buffalo fared slightly better after that, winning another eight games during the final two months of the season.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/21/detroit-pistons-losing-streak-nba/,Washington Post,2023-12-21 21:51:00,
"NEW YORK — A’ja Wilson simply couldn’t be bothered. Before Wednesday night’s Game 4 of the WNBA Finals, the Las Vegas Aces’ star center showed little worry despite the fact that her team was missing two starters and hadn’t won at Barclays Center all season. During the game, she appeared to have one concern: willing her team to victory. NEW YORK — A’ja Wilson simply couldn’t be bothered. Before Wednesday night’s Game 4 of the WNBA Finals, the Las Vegas Aces’ star center showed little worry despite the fact that her team was missing two starters and hadn’t won at Barclays Center all season. During the game, she appeared to have one concern: willing her team to victory. Mission accomplished. Wilson scored a game-high 24 points to go with 16 rebounds to lead the Aces to a 70-69 win that secured a 3-1 victory in the series, making Las Vegas the league’s first back-to-back champion since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001 and 2002. Wilson was named Finals MVP. “We just kept the main thing the main thing, and we came out on top,” she told ESPN on the court immediately after the win. “I can’t express how proud I am of my teammates. They picked me up when I was down. We cried together, prayed together and now we’re popping champagne together.” It hardly came easy. The Aces saw their six-point lead trimmed to one in the final seconds and survived only after Courtney Vandersloot missed what would have been a game-winner. It left Wilson and company dancing on the floor afterward. “There’s a reason it hasn’t been done in that long of a time period,” Aces forward Alysha Clark said of repeating as champs. “It’s hard to do. It’s hard to get to the Finals multiple times. . . . You never know when you’re going to get this moment, when you’re going to get this opportunity — regardless of what team you have.”  added 16 points for Las Vegas, and Cayla George had 11. Clark chipped in a much-needed 10 points and eight rebounds. Kelsey Plum had an off shooting night (2 for 12) but contributed seven points, eight rebounds and five assists. “This one’s sweeter,” Aces Coach Becky Hammon said. “It just is. It’s harder to do. We went from darling to villain real quick. We had our names, our good names slandered. And all these women did was lock in together. And that’s why I’m so confident. It’s because I know exactly who’s in that locker room. I know exactly who I’m going to war with every day. This is probably the tightest group I’ve ever been around. And they’re a special group. I don’t know what else you can throw at them.” The Aces, the top seed in the playoffs after a dominant 34-6 regular season, trailed by nine at halftime but turned the game with a red-hot third quarter. They closed the period on an 18-5 run as Wilson and Clark took over while New York, the No. 2 seed after going 32-8, shot 5 for 20 in the period. The fourth quarter was a back-and-forth affair, the tension ratcheting up with each possession and the Barclays Center crowd getting so loud that players were finding it difficult to hear. Then the No. 1 picks went back to work. With the score knotted at 64, Young scored four straight points, including a nasty step-through layup. Then Wilson buried a turnaround jumper with a hand in her face with 1:26 remaining. The Aces wouldn’t score again, but their defense held firm when it had to. Vandersloot, who had 19 points in her best game of the series, hit a three-pointer from the wing, and Sabrina Ionescu connected on an elbow jumper to make it a one-point game with 41.7 seconds remaining. Wilson had a chance to make it a three-point game coming out of a timeout, but Breanna Stewart came to help and blocked her shot. The Liberty took a timeout with 8.8 seconds left to set up the final play. “We knew that their game plan was going to be to junk it up and make it difficult, and that’s exactly what happened,” a disconsolate Stewart said. “[Didn’t get] stops when we needed it and couldn’t get anything to drop.” Vandersloot added seven rebounds and six assists. Betnijah Laney scored 15, and Stewart was held to 10 points (on 3-for-17 shooting) and 14 rebounds.   had a quiet night with six points and 11 rebounds. “Of course we’re disappointed,” Liberty Coach Sandy Brondello said. “It would be nice to go and play a Game 5 and lay it all out on the table. Credit to Vegas; they were down, and they found a way. We fought, but it wasn’t our best game today.” The Aces were without starting point guard Chelsea Gray and center Kiah Stokes,  . Gray left in the fourth quarter of Game 3 with a noncontact foot injury and arrived at Tuesday’s practice riding a medical scooter with a walking boot on her left foot. Stokes woke up Monday with pain and arrived at practice in a walking boot on her right foot and on crutches. The pair sat on the end of the bench with teammate Candace Parker, who had surgery on her fractured foot in July. Gray, the 2022 Finals MVP, typically runs the show for the Aces — dictating the pace and flow as a five-time all-star and one of the best point guards in league history. She could be seen coaching from the sideline throughout the game. Las Vegas started its usual trio of No. 1 picks in Wilson, Young and Plum but added Sixth Player of the Year Clark and center George, who made her first start of the year and the first postseason start of her career. She became just the second player in league history to make her first start of a season in the WNBA Finals. The Aces came into Wednesday 0-3 at Barclays Center and trailed 39-30 at halftime.

But already it has seen more traffic than ever, with 1,184 players entering the transfer portal Dec. 5, 409 more than the first day the window opened last year, according to  . Prominent signal callers headline the list of potential transfer players, and that group alone includes former blue-chip recruits, established starters, those planning a jump to their third schools and players for whom all three apply. Check back for updates on some of the biggest names who are transferring this offseason. Quarterback Dante Moore, one of the top recruits in the high school Class of 2023 who threw for 1,610 yards and 11 touchdowns in nine games as a freshman for UCLA this season,   that he will transfer to Oregon. Moore seems likely to back up Dillon Gabriel in 2024, perhaps as a redshirt with eyes on starting in 2025. (Moore has three years of eligibility remaining.) Gabriel, who spent the past two seasons at Oklahoma, announced earlier that he will spend his final season of college eligibility with the Ducks in 2024. Oregon is looking to replace Bo Nix, who was third in the Heisman Trophy voting and will finish his college career in the Fiesta Bowl against Liberty on New Year’s Day. Moore originally committed to Oregon out of high school before flipping to UCLA late in the recruiting process. He started five games for the Bruins this season before being benched after a run of poor play, in part because of UCLA’s leaky offensive line. Multiple outlets, including   and the  , reported that quarterback Malachi Nelson will enter the transfer portal after spending his first college season backing up Caleb Williams at USC. Nelson, one of the top recruits in the high school Class of 2023 and the Gatorade national player of the year as a senior, appeared in only one game this season and completed just one pass. He will be able to use his redshirt and will have four years of eligibility remaining. Nelson’s development was slowed by shoulder surgery just before he arrived at USC. Nelson’s departure will leave the Trojans slim at quarterback for the Holiday Bowl against Louisville on Dec. 27. Williams already has said he will not play in order to focus on the NFL draft, so USC will be left with Miller Moss (32 attempts this season) and Jake Jensen (has not played this season). The Trojans do not have any other quarterbacks signed for next year. Leonard, a two-year starter at Duke, saw his stock rise in 2022 as he threw for 2,967 yards, 20 touchdowns and six interceptions. He also ran for 699 yards and 13 touchdowns. Duke won nine games under then-coach Mike Elko, who was tapped last month to replace Jimbo Fisher at Texas A&M. But neither Leonard nor Duke found that same success this season after a toe injury limited the junior to seven games — the same number of wins Duke has this season. Leonard has thrown for 1,102 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions, while rushing for 352 yards and four touchdowns this season. The junior committed to Notre Dame on Dec. 12. A dream come true. Go Irish ☘️  The Buckeyes’ starter for all 12 games during the regular season, McCord is joining the Orange for his final year of eligibility after he reportedly learned that OSU was opening up its quarterback competition in 2024. In comments Sunday to  , McCord hailed the work of new Syracuse head coach Fran Brown and added, “I think the pieces are all coming together at the right time.” McCord’s decision to transfer may have come as a shock given his credentials on paper: A former top 10 quarterback recruit who led the Buckeyes to an 11-1 record and a shot at the College Football Playoff before a close loss to Michigan in late November. Following the recent lineage of elite Ohio State quarterbacks, McCord wasn’t spectacular in his junior campaign, but he completed 65.8 percent of his passes for 3,170 yards, 24 touchdowns and six interceptions. He edged sophomore Devin Brown for the starting job during the offseason, but Ohio State Coach Ryan Day waited until mid-September to appoint McCord the full-time starter. Speaking to media in early December, Day was noncommittal in naming a starter moving forward. McCord’s announcement came the following day. 🍊  Nolen, the No. 2 overall prospect in 247Sports’ Class of 2022 rankings, played two years at Texas A&M before announcing his decision to leave the program on Sunday. Nolen headlined what was the highest-rated recruiting class in the country last year, but now, he’s one of its latest members to defect after Fisher was fired in November. (It’s also worth noting that Nolen announced his decision shortly after the departure of former Texas A&M defensive line coach Elijah Robinson, who recruited Nolen to College Station but took the defensive coordinator job at Syracuse in early December). Nolen is a sophomore with two years of eligibility remaining. He evolved from a rotational player as a freshman to a starter on the top defense in the SEC this year, registering 37 tackles, including 8.5 tackles for a loss and four sacks. Cameron Ward transferred from Incarnate Word to Washington State ahead of the 2022 season. The year before, Ward was named a second-team FCS all-American after throwing for 4,648 yards, 47 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. After jumping to the FBS, those numbers predictably dipped some, but he improved in 2023, leading the nation’s No. 3 passing offense while throwing for 3,732 yards, 25 touchdowns and seven interceptions — plus another eight touchdowns on the ground. With Washington State set to remain in a new-look Pac-12 alongside Oregon State next year, Ward is taking his services elsewhere. In his announcement, the junior also said he would be evaluating his prospects for the 2024 NFL Draft. Speaking of Oregon State, starting quarterback DJ Uiagalelei will leave Corvallis, Ore., almost a year after announcing his decision to transfer there following three seasons at Clemson. Uiagalelei this year led the Beavers to an 8-4 record and a Sun Bowl showdown against Notre Dame on Dec. 29. The junior’s 2023 stats mirrored those in his final season at Clemson. He threw for 2,638 yards, 21 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2023. The California native could be heading back east next year, with top suitors in Florida State and Louisville, according to ESPN. Forever a Beaver 🦫🖤!!  Gabriel, one of the top signal callers in the portal, leaves Oklahoma two seasons after transferring from Central Florida, where he played for three years. In five seasons of college football, Gabriel has completed 63 percent of his passes for 14,865 yards and 125 touchdowns to 26 interceptions. Gabriel announced he will transfer to Oregon, where he looks to replace departing starter and Heisman Trophy candidate Bo Nix — a 2022 transfer from Auburn. The Hawaii native missed much of the 2021 season at UCF with a broken left clavicle, then transferred to Oklahoma in 2022, earning Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year honors that year. This past season, he threw for 3,660 yards, 30 touchdowns and six interceptions while leading the Sooners to a 10-2 record. MARCUS APPROVED! 🎱    Rogers on Friday  , where the senior signal caller could replace Heisman Trophy runner-up Michael Penix Jr. in the Huskies’ high-octane attack. Rogers told ESPN that the Huskies’ offensive system, which produced the nation’s top passing offense this year, played a major factor in his decision. In four seasons at Mississippi State, Rogers became one of the most prolific passers in the SEC, throwing for 12,315 yards, second-most in conference history. He threw 94 touchdowns to 28 interceptions in his career. The senior has one year of eligibility remaining.

I expect that we have unfinished business, such as zoning for cannabis shops, forest conservation law update, 10-year solid waste plan update, clarifications to the new zoning ordinance, and hanging over everything will be the budget. I will continue to advocate for High Point High School reconstruction, a replacement fire station in South Laurel and relocation of the Division VI police station in Beltsville. Most proud of: the Climate Action Plan, which aims for the county to halve its climate emissions by 2030. Would revisit:  to modernize our department of inspection and enforcement to do more virtual tickets. … I think making sure we virtualize our process is important. Passing the budget is any council’s biggest accomplishment. … Nothing happens without the money. I think people not collaborating and I think blunders about communicating to the public what we are doing. You see that with the zoning legislation [about] cannabis businesses that did not pass. The entire conversation was about legalization and the bill had nothing to do with legalization. I think public safety will be huge. The DMV, to me, is grappling with issues around juvenile crime. Transportation safety, pedestrian safety and walkability are going to be huge. I think helping seniors to age in place, the cost of living and how seniors are going to manage in the county are going to be huge. Modernizing DPIE (the Department of Permitting, Inspections and Enforcement), cleaning up our community, serving our immigrant community … making sure everything with the Purple Line is going smoothly. Sometimes being a council member isn’t just passing a magical bill. It’s keeping people accountable. It’s having hearings because there might be issues. I’m most proud of the Walkable Urban Streets Act, which will make our streets safer for all users, especially pedestrians and cyclists. It places best practices in urban street design into the county road standards. … Types of improvements include reducing distances for pedestrians to cross streets, narrowing lane widths, adding off-street bike accommodations, creating sharper turns so that vehicles need to stop and look before turning at an intersection, and other measures. Among our first actions, we repealed measures that would have undermined the countywide zoning ordinance and the public process that established it. I wouldn’t call it a failure, just something that is in progress and not completed yet. I started the process to establish a noise enforcement program through the Department of Permitting, Inspections, and Enforcement. We have made good progress, but we do not yet have a fully operational program with a dedicated noise enforcement hotline. We are likely facing a tight budget this year that may include tough decisions. In addition, I am planning to focus on the following: affordable housing — the county has a real need for more affordable housing options, particularly near transit. Permitting, inspections and enforcement — we made progress in 2023 putting more resources into these areas, but we need to continue that progress and responsiveness. Crossing guards — it is unacceptable that we have over 80 vacancies countywide. Every school should have a full complement of crossing guards. Mental health — the council needs to build upon [work it has begun] to increase the services and the responsiveness for county residents and their families in need of mental health services. My ongoing work in District 3 includes addressing neighborhood quality-of-life issues of code enforcement, infrastructure and speeding; addressing storm water and flooding; connecting our communities with new trails and increasing pedestrian infrastructure; facilitating smart growth redevelopment around transit; addressing food insecurity; and ensuring that Purple Line construction is done with as little disruption as possible. Most proud of: universal design, which requires developers who are building new homes to include features that make it possible for seniors to age in place, and anyone with a permanent or temporary disability to be able to more easily remain in their homes. These features will also make it possible for people to visit each other without the barriers that stairs or no first-floor bathroom creates. Would revisit: rent stabilization. We had to put in a stopgap measure to stop a few unscrupulous big landlords from dramatically and unethically increasing rents on some of our residents. Unfortunately, we had to use a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel. We have to come up with a plan that doesn’t penalize our good landlords … while at the same time protecting our renting residents from landlords who prioritize their profits over the public. There was a renewed commitment by the council to be transparent in its deliberations and to make a greater effort to hear the voices in the community. The commitment was to work to support families, increase opportunities for local minority businesses, to be bold on environmental and climate issues, and to pay closer attention to smart growth and the need for quality development. Occasionally, discussions on important issues didn’t start soon enough to help craft the strongest bills. It’s important to talk to people on every side of an issue, to the people who lead agencies affected by legislation, and to people in the community well before a bill is drafted. Our budget is facing a serious deficit, and a big driver of that is the mandate from the state that we continue to dramatically increase education spending. Everyone wants more money for schools, but that money has to come from somewhere. We need to work with our state legislators to rebalance and rethink education funding. Our property taxes are already high, so we need to find innovative and effective ways to increase our understaffed police and fire departments, enhance our social services for those who need them, and to support our struggling families. Too many children walk to schools on unsafe routes. We need to add sidewalks on these streets, speed bumps on others and crossing guards to help at especially busy locations. Given our budgetary constraints, we’ll have to be creative in figuring out how to make sure our students arrive to school safely. Most proud of:  , which will require security [cameras] at high-occupancy dwellings. There has been an increase in crime in apartments and age-restricted senior housing dwellings. While surveillance cameras will not completely prevent crime, they can serve as a tool to deter criminal activity. Would revisit:  , an ordinance to temporarily pause for two years the development of townhouse and townhouse-related residential uses outside of areas designated for medium- to high-density development in the county’s approved general plan and comprehensive plans. This bill did not pass the council this year. I proposed   in response to the rise in chronic illnesses and the county’s lack of healthy food options. … The bill requires the Prince George’s County government to provide incentives to businesses offering foods deemed “healthy” by the county health department’s Healthcare Action Coalition and a registered dietitian. I voted to legalize marijuana in Maryland but do not want marijuana products to be sold so close to our youth and vulnerable populations in my district. That is why I co-proposed  . This bill would have kept new marijuana dispensaries away from residential areas and shopping centers and in industrial zones, so that they are away from our communities. This bill passed in the committee of the whole, but failed in the council session on Nov. 21. I will [be] working with my colleagues to introduce an environmental package of bills in 2024. … I am looking to co-author a bill with Thomas Dernoga of District 1 to require charging infrastructure and electric vehicle charging station “ready” spaces to support electric vehicle charging stations at newly constructed commercial retail developments and office buildings, and near multiunit dwellings in residential areas. In 2024, some of the issues I will be focusing on are: homeowners association legislation to address issues and conflicts, addressing affordable housing through land bank legislation and other such options, and programs and services that will help our senior community. Most proud of: the temporary Rent Stabilization Act of 2023 (which set rent hike caps). I think it’s something I’m most proud of because there were so many people who were in immediate need who were suffering, and we were able to see the direct impact of that legislation instantly. Also, the guaranteed income pilot program. There’s a large conversation around federal and state together to look at guaranteed basic income … the more local jurisdictions that do this, the more likely we could see an influx of resources on a state and federal level. Would revisit: the cannabis zoning legislation. It’s our legislative duty to come up with our own regulations for this new industry. My goal is for us to pass something that all of us as a council can support. [Residents] feel the difference in the legislation that we’re moving, and they feel that the legislation, for the first time in a long time, represents directly the issues that they’re seeing in their community. It’s an attempt to actually prioritize all the things that people [campaign] to run things. … I think that’s something we can be proud of. For me, just as an individual legislator, I think it’s just that learning curve. Even though I have been a policy director for a council before, I’ve been in the community, there’s a difference when you’re sitting in the seat and truly understanding all of the things that you have at your fingertips to impact your community. Top priority for me is permanent rent stabilization. I think in managing the budget situation that we find ourselves with … thinking about how we create other revenue streams is going to be a priority for me. … I don’t believe in the notion that because we’re in a budget crisis, that means we cannot create new initiatives. I’ve always felt that the first thing you have to look at is, how do we spend the money we have? The specific issues are just a continuation of the focus that I’ve had so far. We talk about food insecurity, the lack of nice and affordable housing in the district. I plan to continue to push for resources and better partnerships with the nonprofits in our district, making sure that the funding and the budget is equitably spent inside of the Beltway. The second thing is really focusing on these development projects that are coming into my district and making sure that I’m having early conversations about what these projects look like. Are they affordable and market rate? Because we need both. Most proud of: I’d pick a theme, the workers rights package (CB-33-2023, CB-4-2023) … then, the responsible contractors resolution and bill … basically, puts teeth to procurement requirements because before, you could be a contractor engaging in wage theft and there were no real penalties in place. … What I’m most proud of is our council and the issues that I’ve worked on have been worker rights issues and economic issues requiring the county to put project labor agreements in place to recruit, hire and train Prince Georgians to work on county jobs. I believe we have the needs of everyday Prince Georgians, first and foremost, in our legislation even when the business community or the industry or some sort of outside force with more power didn’t want it. I do think we kept our word this year on that agenda (especially with rent stabilization, workers rights and minority business legislation). We did so even when it wasn’t easy. … Every time we tried to do something, they told us the world would collapse. Rent stabilization? Oh! The world is going to collapse! PLAs [project labor agreements]? Oh! The world is going to collapse. I was deeply disturbed when the county executive vetoed the $250,000 for the emerging adults program in the state’s attorney’s office, which was proven to reduce crime. … There must be some issues that are greater than personal political agendas. Public safety and affordable housing. I want to make sure I fight for additional programming, youth programming and things of that nature. Park and Planning receive a lot of money and the return on investment for Prince Georgians is not there frankly. It’s going to be important that we continue to provide additional services, leveraging that local impact grant that allowed us to do free community college. I’m also going to be announcing a mental health initiative for the district, a senior program … all types of programs that will uplift the district. Proud of: Franklin, Hawkins and I worked on  . … There seemed to be appraisal bias that was happening in Prince George’s County where [real estate appraisers were] devaluing of the value of somebody’s home in Prince George’s County. [We put] proper measures in place to hold bad actors accountable now. [We’re] making sure that we send the message out to those people that seem to be … not creating the fair and equitable balance that protects people’s most prized investment in Prince George’s County. Making sure that a procurement process is fair and equitable for local community-based businesses and minority businesses right here in Prince George’s County. Our communication hasn’t always been great. We all represent a district. One of the greatest things this council is learning how to do is learning how to communicate with one another. With anything, everything takes time to grow. We’re a growing body right now trying to find solutions together. It doesn’t mean respect has been lost. Cost containment is critical. We’re spending from an empty well telling people we’re going to go find the water. It’s been an honor over the last year to work with each one of my colleagues, but my main focus is now making sure we do everything in our power to keep our Triple-A bond rating. … We have dire fiscal responsibilities that we have to attend to. That’s going to force us to work together even stronger. Prince George’s ranks 24 out of 24 counties [in outpatient services]. The prevention services haven’t been so readily available. … In my district, 1 out of 4 deaths is from a heart attack … [and we lead] the county in low-birth-weight babies. We have to do better … everyone deserves to have quality access to outpatient services.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/06/prince-georges-county-council-new-term/,Washington Post,2023-12-06 06:00:00,

It’s been evident for a long time that Republicans — and supporters of  , especially — take a more no-holds-barred approach to politics than Democrats do. They’re much more likely to  , for instance. It’s also become clear that Trump being convicted of a felony  . But for apparently the first time, we can affix a number to how many of them think that Trump breaking the law for political ends is okay. About 3 in 10. That’s the finding of a   this weekend. It phrased the question thusly: Voters who supported Trump in 2020 were about twice as likely to endorse the break-rules-and-laws view as 2020 Biden backers. While 65 percent of Trump backers said a president should always follow the rules and the law, 30 percent said breaking rules and laws could be justified. The split among Biden voters was 83-15 against breaking rules and laws. The new poll builds on previous polling showing a greater appetite on the right for disregarding the usual guardrails. The Public Religion Research Institute over the years has asked a similar question about whether a president should be “willing to break some rules if that’s what it takes to set things right.” In October, it found   with that statement, and a majority of Republicans who viewed Trump favorably agreed. Back during the 2016 campaign, Trump primary supporters were significantly more likely to endorse that statement than supporters of other GOP candidates; Trump primary voters  . Where the new Fox poll breaks ground is in adding a significant phrase: “and laws.” Respondents weren’t just being asked about violating some long-standing political or governmental norms, or testing the bounds of a president’s constitutional prerogatives; they were asked whether doing something illegal is theoretically justified. And while nearly two-thirds of 2020 Trump backers disagreed, that 30 percent is a huge segment of America. (Unlike the 2016 poll, there doesn’t seem to be a substantial divide between Republicans who back Trump in the primaries and other Republicans; the number for Trump 2024 primary backers specifically is 28 percent — similar to Republicans overall.) It’s valid to ask how much people actually, in their heart of hearts, endorse a president breaking the law. Perhaps many of those who would endorse a president breaking rules focused on that half of the question, ignoring the part about breaking  . But the full question included breaking laws, and that didn’t seem to be enough to dissuade 3 in 10 on the American political right from aligning with the view. It’s easy to see this manifesting itself in some significant ways in the months and years to come. One obvious way is if Trump is convicted of trying to subvert the 2020 election and/or withholding classified documents. The GOP’s defense mechanism right now is mostly that Trump is innocent and/or being politically targeted. But if the evidence winds up being overwhelming, it’s not out of the question that many backers could reason that Trump was somehow justified in what he did — either because they wrongly believe the election  stolen or because he might have had some kind of good reason to keep those documents. The   attack on the Capitol is a good example of how that can play out. Confronted with overwhelming evidence of Trump supporters turning violent to overturn the election, many Republicans have talked themselves into the idea that the insurrection was in some ways  or  . The other big way this matters is in what it could portend if Trump is elected again. Trump and his supporters have made little secret that they intend to  . This suggests that a substantial portion of the party views going beyond the law as potentially necessary and justified. They could form a (potentially loud) base of support urging him on. We should expect more polling where this comes from. And we should all keep a close eye on it.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/18/3-10-trump-voters-want-president-willing-break-rules-laws/,Washington Post,2023-12-18 15:44:00,
"NASHVILLE — Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who woke up Tuesday with a pristine baseball legacy that included a curse-breaking stolen base and a relentlessly successful career in the dugout, did the unthinkable Tuesday afternoon. Surrounded by reporters eager for a comment on whether his team — the team seen as the favorite to land Shohei Ohtani for years, one of few teams with the money to do it, the team located mere minutes from the place Ohtani has made his home since he came to the United States from Japan — met with the two-way star, Roberts told the truth. NASHVILLE — Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts, who woke up Tuesday with a pristine baseball legacy that included a curse-breaking stolen base and a relentlessly successful career in the dugout, did the unthinkable Tuesday afternoon. Surrounded by reporters eager for a comment on whether his team — the team seen as the favorite to land Shohei Ohtani for years, one of few teams with the money to do it, the team located mere minutes from the place Ohtani has made his home since he came to the United States from Japan — met with the two-way star, Roberts told the truth. “I would like to be honest,” Roberts said. “So we met with Shohei, and we talked, and I think it went well.” And just like that, the maddeningly quiet MLB winter meetings were consumed by sound and fury, because everyone at the Gaylord Opryland Resort knew that Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, had made it clear to his suitors that any leaks about which teams the biggest baseball star on the planet might be meeting with would be held against them. “Twenty-eight more managers and he’s ours!” joked a front-office member whose team never had much chance. The Dodgers, meanwhile, were not laughing much at all. When the Los Angeles Times asked Dodgers President Andrew Friedman to comment on Roberts’s comments, or on the team’s  pursuit of Ohtani, he said he would not. When their general manager, Brandon Gomes, met with reporters as part of a scheduled session a few minutes later, he chose his words carefully. “Dave made a comment; for us personally, we don’t feel comfortable going into it any further,” Gomes said, citing the loosely heeded rule against free agent tampering as the reason for his unwillingness to say anything. Asked whether he thought the breach would hurt the Dodgers’ chances of signing Ohtani, he said, “I have no idea.” “I think this is all so personal, and, like I said, we’re not going to go into free agent world making comments,” Gomes added. “But it’s going to play out how it’s going to play out.” How Ohtani’s free agency has played out, to this point, is a fury of speculation fueled by silence — both from teams too scared to violate the widely understood rules of Ohtani’s process and from Ohtani himself. The biggest star in the sport has not spoken publicly since he injured his elbow in August, a conspicuous drought for the most prominent baseball player in the world navigating a   before he became the most coveted free agent anyone can remember. Last month, after he was named  , Ohtani skipped a scheduled conference call with reporters. When a Sports Illustrated reporter tried to learn the name of the dog Ohtani held in his arms as the award was announced on MLB Network, members of Ohtani’s team and the Angels said they could not comment. The MLB Network hosts knew better than to ask for information as personal as that. So for more than a month now, the entire industry has been searching for clues. On Monday, it found a few. Ohtani followed San Francisco Giants pitcher Logan Webb on Instagram, the clearest indication yet that he may be considering the Giants as a landing spot, as some had expected he might. Later in the day, Toronto Blue Jays Manager John Schneider was unavailable for his long-scheduled news conference and General Manager Ross Atkins was nowhere to be found in Nashville. A Blue Jays fan tracked down flights from Anaheim to Clearwater, Fla., near the team’s spring training home. When Schneider ambled into his rescheduled news conference Tuesday, cameras followed him closely and questions ranging from “Did you meet with Ohtani?” to “You look tan — were you in Florida to meet with Ohtani?” greeted him. “I live in Florida, so I arrived here last night,” Schneider said. “I think who we meet with and where we meet them, we keep to ourselves.” Schneider repeated the second part of that answer several times. Not long after,   dodged similar questions about his team’s pursuit by insisting that he, specifically, had not met with Ohtani, even when someone asked if his team had instead. “I don’t think this is my spot to talk about individual players,” Counsell said. But the reality of the situation, whatever they say, is that no one wants to talk about this specific player. New York Yankees Manager Aaron Boone, for example, beamed and joked when a reporter asked him whether he thought   — who has not made similar demands for secrecy — would look good in pinstripes. “I think he probably would,” Boone said before offering that 25-year-old pitchers of Yamamoto’s caliber are difficult to find and that he expects to meet with him soon. Ohtani is now, as ever, something completely different. And that is why what Roberts did Tuesday, when he admitted the Dodgers hosted Ohtani at Dodger Stadium for a few hours last week, when he explained that they tried to answer Ohtani’s questions and give him a sense of who they are, was treated by his own colleagues like a disclosure of intolerable proportions. “It’s pretty easy to have conversations with anyone if you feel comfortable in what you’re about, who you work with,” Roberts said. “We’re about people, we’re about winning, and so I think that that’s pretty easy to talk about. … There’s no hiding of the ball. It’s just kind of, ‘Here we are.’ And we really hope he feels it’s a fit.” The trouble, of course, is that hiding the ball has been Ohtani’s approach to his free agency since long before it began — so much so that Roberts’s own general manager not only declined to comment on Ohtani but said it was wrong for anyone to do so. When it comes to Ohtani, candor qualifies as scandal. The Dodgers and their manager will now wait and wonder what his transgression might cost.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/05/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-free-agency-dave-roberts/,Washington Post,2023-12-05 19:19:00,
"Gaston Glock, an Austrian engineer who created the flat-nosed, plastic-body handgun carried by military and police forces around the world, glorified in films and rap lyrics and decried by gun-control advocates as one of the growing weapons of the streets, died Dec. 27 at 94. The Glock company announced the death but gave no other details. Gaston Glock, an Austrian engineer who created the flat-nosed, plastic-body handgun carried by military and police forces around the world, glorified in films and rap lyrics and decried by gun-control advocates as one of the growing weapons of the streets, died Dec. 27 at 94. The Glock company announced the death but gave no other details. The popularity of the Glock semiautomatic made Mr. Glock a billionaire and added his name to the array of weapons known by their makers:  , Beretta, Colt,   and others. Mr. Glock’s path, however, may have been among the most improbable: a small-business tinkerer who once made door hinges and curtain rods. He had not even held a gun since he was conscripted into Germany’s military near the end of World War II. Then in 1980, he learned the Austrian military was seeking a new sidearm. Without any formal training in firearm design, he devised the first Glock model, the  , named for being his 17th patent after inventions such as a variation on the collapsible shovel, according to the Glock company. Mr. Glock gradually disappeared from the public eye, even as the 9mm handgun he crafted built a global presence. He increasingly spent his time behind the walls of a lakeside estate in Velden Am Wörthersee in southern Austria. His company, meanwhile, adopted a strategy of aggressive dealmaking and promotion. The goal was to make selling points out of characteristics that were initially mocked, particularly the Glock’s lightweight, polymer frame and blocky metal barrel. Glock sponsored elaborate displays at trade shows and pitched stories to publications such as Soldier of Fortune, which ran a  in 1984 titled “Plastic Perfection” on the Glock 17. Mr. Glock already had the Austrian military contract and was supplying Norway’s armed forces and others. He wanted next to break into the U.S. market, with its huge retail gun sales and thousands of law enforcement agencies. The late 1980s worked to Mr. Glock’s advantage. Increasingly powerful drug gangs and other underworld groups left many police forces feeling outgunned and imperiled. Glock marketed its handgun as an answer. Police departments across the United States were given Glocks to test on shooting ranges. Discounts were offered. Company envoys touted the weapon’s reliability in all kinds of weather. Unlike a six-shot revolver, the standard Glock had clips   rounds. (Later models expanded to 33.) Glock set up a U.S. plant in Smyrna, Ga., and departments began to line up. In 1988, the D.C. police suspended normal bidding procedures and  4,300 Glocks for $1.3 million to replace its Smith & Wesson and Colt revolvers. Currently, more than 65 percent of federal, state and local agencies in the United States have Glock pistols, according to the company. The Glock is also used by police and military in nearly 50 countries. “And this gun, when it first arrived in the U.S., was disparaged as ugly, as handgun Tupperware,” Paul M. Barrett, the author of “ ” (2012),   on NPR’s “Tell Me More.” Barrett noted that Glock’s plan to court U.S. police departments was deliberate. “That would give the gun credibility in the much larger, much more lucrative civilian market, where you can charge full price and get your full profit margin,” he said. Yet the gun also represented the rise in firepower on America’s streets among gangs, drug networks and others. The Glock was mentioned in rap songs for decades by artists such as Wu-Tang Clan,   and Lil Wayne, helping give it a gangster mystique that drew concern from police forces even as they adopted the same handgun. Congressional hearings were called over the Glock’s light-touch trigger and rapid-fire capacity — issues raised by gun-control groups after a  was used in the 2007  at Virginia Tech that claimed 32 lives. Mr. Glock rarely gave interviews and declined to address outcry from gun-control advocates. All the while, the Glock increasingly found its way into popular culture in films such as “Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines” and “The Matrix Reloaded,” both from 2003. “Get yourself a Glock and lose that nickel-plated sissy pistol,” actor Tommy Lee Jones said in the 1998   “U.S. Marshals.” In 2021, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) released a showing her putting a Glock in a holster and then purportedly walking through the streets of Washington with the concealed weapon. “The Glock … inherited all aspects of the American firearm heritage,” Barrett wrote in his book. “It was seen as an instrument of law and security, but also menace, danger and fear.” It’s unclear how much attention the reclusive Mr. Glock paid to it all. His few brushes with media came during court battles with his first wife and questions over his ties to Austrian far-right political figure   — and after Mr. Glock remarkably fended off an apparent murder attempt in 1999. The plot was hatched by his financial adviser, Charles Ewert, to conceal his embezzlement from Mr. Glock’s company, authorities said. Mr. Glock was ambushed in a garage in Luxembourg by a hired assailant, a former professional wrestler named Jacques Pêcheur, who wielded a hard rubber mallet. Mr. Glock, who was 70 at the time, fought back and managed to knock out some of Pêcheur’s teeth. Ewert and Pêcheur were   in 2003 of attempted murder. Mr. Glock’s company was investigated for fiscal improprieties, such as concealing income through shell companies. Some company officials were prosecuted, but Mr. Glock was not charged. “I was fighting for my life,” Mr. Glock  Forbes in 2003, recalling the assault. “The attack was the best thing that happened to me,” he added. “Otherwise, I would have gone on trusting [Ewert].” Gaston Glock was born July 19, 1929, in Vienna. His father worked on the Austrian railroad; his mother was a homemaker. He studied mechanical engineering at a college in Vienna and later took jobs that included manager of a car-radiator factory. He and his first wife, Helga, opened a business in 1963 in their garage in Deutsch-Wagram outside Vienna, using a metal press to make consumer items such as curtain rods and brass fittings. They later won a contract to make knives for the Austrian Army. Through his military connections, Mr. Glock heard about Austria’s search in 1980 for a new service pistol. In 2021, Forbes estimated Mr. Glock’s personal fortune at $1.1 billion. Among his personal projects was construction of Austria’s  , which hosts races and other events. After his divorce from Helga Glock in 2011, she began litigation to seek alimony and a greater share in the company. She was awarded alimony but lost her bid for other payments. Mr. Glock had three children from that marriage: a daughter, Brigitte, and sons Gaston Jr. and Robert. In 2011, Mr. Glock married Kathrin Tschikof, his nurse after he had a stroke in 2008.

"The Year of the Backup Quarterback is an awfully kind and deceptive slogan. This NFL season isn’t theirs as much as it is a bad time to be a starting quarterback. The Year of the Broken Starter doesn’t exactly capture the imagination, however. So here we are, watching too many teams compete in a playoff race with a spare tire. Because the sport can sell anything, we’ve favored the people over the predicament, leaning into the soul-stirring stories of an underdog such as Jake Browning,   or  It’s more uplifting to be charmed by Tommy DeVito than forced to dissect how the New York Giants have allowed 76 sacks and lost two quarterbacks to injury this season. The Year of the Backup Quarterback is an awfully kind and deceptive slogan. This NFL season isn’t theirs as much as it is a bad time to be a starting quarterback. The Year of the Broken Starter doesn’t exactly capture the imagination, however. So here we are, watching too many teams compete in a playoff race with a spare tire. Because the sport can sell anything, we’ve favored the people over the predicament, leaning into the soul-stirring stories of an underdog such as Jake Browning,   or  It’s more uplifting to be charmed by Tommy DeVito than forced to dissect how the New York Giants have allowed 76 sacks and lost two quarterbacks to injury this season. As Week 16 began Thursday, just 14 of the league’s 32 original starting quarterbacks had played every game. How important is basic availability? Just two of those QBs — first-time starters   and  — entered the week with losing records. In reality, the Year of the Backup Quarterback is more of an extended plight. Last season, 22 starters missed at least one game because of injury or poor performance. The attrition led to a postseason in which Skylar Thompson had to start for the Miami Dolphins and Tyler Huntley for the Baltimore Ravens. Brock Purdy, who has climbed from Mr. Irrelevant to capable starter to MVP candidate in a year’s time, was the fairy-tale outlier in the group of quarterbacks thrust into duty last season. This time around, quarterback absences could have a greater influence on the playoff picture. In a tight AFC with 13 teams still vying for seven spots, the Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals and Indianapolis Colts entered the week in position to make the postseason despite losing their signal callers to season-ending injuries long ago. The Pittsburgh Steelers, who   since Kenny Pickett’s ankle injury, still linger in the conversation. In the NFC, the Minnesota Vikings occupied the final spot, but Dobbs — who began the season as Kyler Murray’s injury replacement on the Arizona Cardinals, only to   after Kirk Cousins tore his Achilles’ tendon — must help them hold off the Seattle Seahawks and a handful of others. As nice as it would be to focus only on praising the understudy persistence, coaching improvisation and overall grit of these teams, the trend of wounded quarterbacks is alarming. Aaron Rodgers   with the New York Jets. Anthony Richardson, the athletic prodigy and fascinating experiment,   of his rookie season in Indianapolis. Joe Burrow   after Cincinnati   to a $275 million contract. Justin Herbert, Deshaun Watson, Daniel Jones and Cousins are high-profile players. Most of these quarterbacks were gone long before Thanksgiving. Many of their teams have shown what they can do without them. It has been admirable and could bode well for their futures. But that doesn’t help during the first round of the playoffs in three weeks. Within the typical parity, there is a caste system right now, one predetermined by health at the sport’s most important position. The eight current division leaders have quarterbacks in relative good health, though Jacksonville’s Trevor Lawrence, who was already playing through an ankle injury, is now in the concussion protocol. Good injury fortune always matters in this collision sport, but consider how the lines are currently drawn. The 49ers and Ravens have conference-best 11-3 records. Four teams — Miami, Dallas, Philadelphia and Detroit — are 10-4. Kansas City and Cleveland are 9-5. The remaining 22 teams are either flirting with .500 or looking for a draft savior. Buffalo is the only team that started Week 16 below the nine-win threshold that realistically has a chance to make serious playoff noise. Then again, we’ve said that for years about the Bills, but they’ve been to just one conference title game despite seeming like high-level Super Bowl contenders since 2020. And they’re still in a helluva fight just to earn a wild-card spot. It has been a wild year because of the quarterback trauma, but it could make for a simple postseason. The AFC is especially bare. The Browns, for all their defensive might, can’t win it all with a 38-year-old Flacco. It appears the Ravens, Dolphins, Bills and defending champion Chiefs are the credible options. But Miami hasn’t beaten a top-end team. Buffalo is erratic. And Kansas City plays as though it has a bunch of wide receivers with carpal tunnel trying to catch passes from Patrick Mahomes. That puts Baltimore in a favored position — assuming Lamar Jackson, who has missed time this year, can avoid the late-season absences that plagued him the previous two seasons. In the NFC, there are San Francisco, Dallas, Detroit and Philadelphia (on a three-game losing streak) — and no one else capable of being more than a one-round spoiler. The January outlook would be so much better if more quarterbacks had been able to stay upright. These uneven playoffs desperately need C.J. Stroud, a refreshing and dynamic rookie recovering from a concussion, to come back and lead the Houston Texans to the big show, just for the sake of quarterback star power. With offensive lines laboring to block an abundance of wondrously athletic pass rushers, the NFL seems to have completed a shift from an era of offensive fireworks to a grim reality that defenses are prepared to make quarterbacks pay for being so reliant on the pass. In 2022, six quarterbacks were sacked at least 40 times. This season, four have been dropped at least 40 times already. The league is on pace to have 10 quarterbacks surpass 40 sacks. The Giants’ 76 sacks are the third most in league history. They’re just two behind the 1997 Cardinals for second place. In 1986, Philadelphia set the standard for O-line and strategic ineptitude, surrendering 104 sacks. With three games remaining, the Giants couldn’t possibly let DeVito get hit enough to approach that record. Right? That would be a horrible way for the Year of the Backup Quarterback to end. But it might fit the season’s painful theme better.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/23/nfl-backup-quarterbacks/,Washington Post,2023-12-23 08:53:00,
"A   in Washington's West End will now open in the spring or summer instead of this year as city officials had originally hoped, representatives from the city’s Department of Human Services said Wednesday, pushing the timeline back at least six months on a project that has been divisive in the surrounding community. A   in Washington's West End will now open in the spring or summer instead of this year as city officials had originally hoped, representatives from the city’s Department of Human Services said Wednesday, pushing the timeline back at least six months on a project that has been divisive in the surrounding community. The District in August closed on a $27.5 million purchase of the Aston, a former George Washington University dormitory, with the intent of converting it into the city’s first homeless shelter that would allow adult couples and mixed-gendered adult families to stay together, offering privacy as well as services for the medically vulnerable. DHS officials said the delayed timeline largely reflects prolonged contract negotiations with a provider that would coordinate services for shelter residents. At the same time, the shelter has faced external challenges and been the subject of several meetings, strongly worded letters and a   in August who spoke out against nearby property owners who’ve said the shelter should be built somewhere else. In July, a group called the West End DC Community Association filed a lawsuit against the city seeking to delay the building’s sale on procedural grounds, though it was withdrawn after the sale went through. But the same group filed another lawsuit in late October to prevent the city from converting the Aston into a homeless shelter, alleging among other concerns that D.C.'s desire to offer on-site medical services at the facility is a violation of zoning restrictions. The challenges facing the Aston in some ways mirror those that   the construction of shelters in other city locations, which were borne out of a plan from D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) to build short-term shelters in each ward to replace the decaying D.C. General shelter. At a meeting hosted by the neighborhood’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) Wednesday night, DHS chief of staff David Ross said that since the building’s purchase, “there has been a lawsuit, a federal complaint. So that has added to our plan, having to respond to things that maybe we did not anticipate having to respond to. But nevertheless, we have experienced some delays.” A DHS spokesperson told The Washington Post the federal complaint was filed Sept. 24 with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, but declined to comment on details within the complaint. A HUD spokesperson did not immediately return an email Thursday requesting comment. DHS officials also said there have been some changes to the plan for the Aston, compared to what they had laid out to the ANC this summer. Instead of a peak capacity of 190 residents, Ross said, DHS now plans to onboard no more than 50 residents at a time until they reach 100, at which point officials will reevaluate whether the building could support more people. Ross also sought to clarify the medical services that will be offered at the Aston, noting a provider will offer services for people with chronic conditions, like liver disease, who may require visits to a doctor; he said this was similar to offerings at the city’s other shelters, “except that it’s located on-site.” DHS has said medically vulnerable people cannot be as easily accommodated in the city’s other “low-barrier” shelters, which are mostly single-sex and contain congregate sleeping areas with multiple beds. The Aston “is absolutely not a medical facility,” Ross said. “No needles, no drawn blood, no procedures, no anesthesia, so forgive us for being a little loose of the lip by saying medical because that’s what is conjured up,” said Anthony Newman, deputy administrator for DHS’s family services administration. “But health assessments, screenings … medical attention — not medical care.” DHS wants the Aston to attract people who are facing homelessness and may otherwise avoid the city’s low-barrier shelters, including mixed-gendered families and couples. Unlike those facilities, the Aston would have stricter admission criteria, like mandatory case management, which they anticipate will expedite the average stay (an estimated three to five months). But concerns related to medical services at the Aston are at the core of the new lawsuit filed by the West End DC Community Association, which is now represented by Scott Morrison of the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP. In July, Morrison wrote a letter to Ward 2 D.C. Council member Brooke Pinto (D) and the ANC on behalf of residents in nearby condominiums raising questions about zoning as well as concerns about how the shelter might negatively impact public safety and the neighborhood’s local economy. At the time, he told The Post the lawsuit was a “ ” if the group’s concerns were not addressed. The October lawsuit, first reported by the GW Hatchet and Washington City Paper, raises complaints similar to those seen in the letter. It alleges the city “ignored and/or intentionally circumvented” D.C. zoning laws in its efforts to build a medical clinic in a residential zone, and generally failed to get proper zoning approval for the shelter based on the specifics on its design that were communicated over the summer. The suit also argues that an August 2022 determination letter from zoning officials was based on incomplete and outdated information from the District. Spokespeople for DHS and the D.C. Attorney General’s office declined to comment on the lawsuit. When asked about zoning in a June ANC meeting, then-DHS interim director Rachel Pierre said the Aston building was “zoned for what we needed, basically almost turnkey.” Morrison in an interview Tuesday said that beyond the zoning complaints, the West End group behind the suit — which he said includes “hundreds” of residents in the area — feels as though the District government hasn’t been responsive to their concerns on how the shelter might negatively impact the neighborhood, nor their requests to discuss potential alternative locations for it. “No one in our group is against homeless shelters. The problem is where this particular one is located, in one of the most economically viable areas of the entire city,” Morrison said. “The District made a terrible choice in location, we offered to work with them to find another location in that ward — putting it someplace else that doesn’t have pernicious economic effects of locating it at the Aston.” DHS officials in June highlighted the shelter’s location in Ward 2, which is one of the city’s most affluent wards, including multiple nearby grocery stores and nonprofits that support the homeless. And unlike the city’s seven other wards containing shelters from Bowser’s plan, Ward 2′s shelter only serves adult women experiencing homelessness; advocates for the homeless have said that only adds to the new project’s significance in the area. The ANC has   on one facet of the lawsuit that was also raised in the previous legal complaint: a suggestion that the city failed to properly engage the commission on its plans for the Aston. Jim Malec, chair of the ANC, noted in August and again in a tweet this week that the body has held at least 10 hours of meetings about the shelter since June. But on Wednesday, members of the ANC urged District officials to move more quickly to establish a community advisory team that is supposed to help facilitate discussions about the project moving forward. When one commissioner apologized to Ross and Newman for ire that was occasionally directed at DHS from some community members in previous meetings, Newman said he understood, adding repeatedly that DHS wants to be “good neighbors” throughout the process. “We know that people take pride in where they live, it’s important that their voices are respected and this is a very passionate issue,” Newman said. “We’re just pushing, we are supporting and advocating or city’s values, our mayor’s values, in a way that respects the voice of the community.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/16/dc-homeless-shelter-george-washington-university-dorm-delay/,Washington Post,2023-11-16 14:57:00,

"LOS ANGELES — California state Sen. Steve Padilla (D-San Diego)   to introduce a bill aimed at protecting child influencers from financial exploitation, a move that could fuel efforts to regulate the sprawling and growing creator economy.

LOS ANGELES — California state Sen. Steve Padilla (D-San Diego)   to introduce a bill aimed at protecting child influencers from financial exploitation, a move that could fuel efforts to regulate the sprawling and growing creator economy. The proposed law, the Child Content Creator Rights Act, would require that any monetized social media account that features minors in at least 30 percent of its content must set aside a portion of the earnings in a trust that would become available to the children featured in the account once they turn 18. Padilla said the growth of the creator economy and shifts in media consumption, along with his own background in law enforcement focused on protecting minors, led him to introduce the bill. “Even five years ago, 10 years ago, we were consuming information and media in a very different way,” he told The Washington Post. “Now, it’s much more driven by average folks looking at YouTube, and that has allowed influencing to reach new heights very quickly in a way that allows just anybody to have tremendous exposure that was not available to them before.” The bill takes inspiration from California’s Coogan Act, established in 1939, which was in response to the situation of Jackie Coogan, who earned millions of dollars as a child actor but whose parents spent all the money he earned rather than putting it aside for him. The Coogan Act became a model for legislation protecting young actors from similar financial exploitation that passed in New York, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Padilla said he views the Child Content Creator Rights Act as the Coogan Act’s spiritual successor. “Obviously, those protections don’t extend [to the online landscape],” Padilla said, “and so that’s what Senate Bill 764 will hopefully do.” As child influencers become more popular and common, state legislators have shown mixed interest in appetite for regulation in this area. In September, Illinois  . Similar legislation has been introduced in Washington state and  . “I just see it as a necessary good to make sure that we are protecting our children and making sure they are compensated for their work, the same way child actors [are] compensated,” Maryland state delegate Jazz Lewis told  . Young people working in the content creator industry are radically different from child actors. Rather than working long hours on set for a production company or movie studio, a growing number of children  in the hopes of building a media empire , one of YouTube’s biggest stars. Indeed, becoming a full-time content creator is one of the most popular career goals among schoolchildren, surveys suggest. Nearly 30 percent of kids ages 8 to 12 listed “YouTuber” as their top career choice in a global survey conducted in 2019 by the Harris Poll and toymaker Lego, and a Morning Consult survey of Gen Z and millennials in the United States found that more than half of 13-to-38-year-olds — 54 percent — wanted to become social media influencers. Summer camps and educational programs   to meet the demand of kids as young as 6 years old seeking to enter the industry. Many child content creators also  , essentially  . Padilla acknowledged that there are nuances his proposal doesn’t address, such as whether an account run by a minor would be required to set money aside, and that the courts may be required to decide what any law would require. He stressed that his legislation is primarily about protecting children from financial exploitation by their parents or managers. “We want to encourage young entrepreneurs for sure,” he said, “but we don’t want to enable exploitation. And I think there probably is a conversation to be had about at some point and at what scale, and in what means and methods and are they driving that themselves.” He stressed that he is not opposed to young people working, as long as they’re “lawfully engaging in commerce.” “There are certain frameworks and laws all over the country that govern how and when minors are able to earn wages and enter into some commercial contracting,” he said. Padilla added that he hopes that this bill will also inspire more guardrails and labor protections in the content creator industry as a whole. In September, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said that more legislators should scrutinize children’s role in the unregulated creator economy. “Child labor in the online influencer industry seems fraught with problems,” he said in a  . “Involving kids in influencing raises serious risks of exploitation — potential sacrifice of privacy, excessive hours, and lack of fair compensation. They may be providing online content without adequate, or any, protection and oversight.” Goldman Sachs estimated that the creator economy was worth over $250 billion this year and could reach $480 billion by 2027.

She talks frequently about the dangers of “ ” — parents sharing their children’s images on social media — and encourages parents to exclude their children from social media posts or to obscure their identity. “The momentum this movement has gained over the past year has been inspiring to watch,” she said. “ … I have high hopes for the Child Content Creator Rights Act.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/22/creator-economy-child-earnings/,Washington Post,2023-12-22 16:42:00,

December has been a hard month for the Paul VI girls’ basketball team.

This month was no different; Paul VI jumped from one national event to the other, playing teams from Alabama, California, Florida and New York. But the   struggled to keep up with the competition — their youth and injury woes holding them back against the country’s elite. The team also was playing without Coach Scott Allen, who missed the first five weeks of the season as he dealt with the death of his mother. Thursday afternoon’s game against No. 9 Georgetown Visitation in Northwest Washington was Allen’s first one back, and he watched with pride as his team set a more optimistic tone for 2024. The Panthers played a smart, physical game, topping the Cubs, 53-47. “I’ve been doing this for 28 years, and I’ve learned this is supposed to be fun,” Allen said. “You try to keep that perspective. So I told the team after the game, ‘I had fun today.’ Life can be hard, so the opportunity to be back in the gym with these guys is something I’m so thankful for.” Panthers forward Laura Williams, the team’s lone senior, scored 34 of her team’s 53 points. Williams, an athletic 6-foot-3 playmaker, generated one close-range look after another and finished with 15 two-point field goals. “This team has definitely had its ups and downs [since] the beginning of this season,” Williams said. “But I know this group, and I know we’re going to be okay. We’ve had other seasons start slow, and we’re just looking for our groove.” This game opened the D.C. Holiday Hoopla, a two-day showcase event hosted by St. John’s. It is one of many basketball events being held across the region this week, as local programs capitalize on the time off from school between Christmas and New Year’s. The matchup was mostly shaped by which team could better execute a full-court press. In the first half, it was the Panthers (4-7) who applied relentless pressure and built a double-digit lead. The lead disappeared in the third quarter as Visitation (5-5) went to its own press and seized momentum. Visitation senior Toby Nweke sank two free throws to cut the Panthers’ lead to one with one minute remaining in the quarter. That was the closest Visitation would get as Paul VI responded with six quick points. Junior Hazel Grepps scored back-to-back baskets, the second of which came with an opportunity for a three-point play. Grepps missed the ensuing free throw, but Williams scored on a putback as the period ended. The Panthers entered the fourth with a seven-point lead and a renewed sense of control. “Every one of these young players is trying to earn their spot every minute, so I try to tell them to relax,” Williams said. “I don’t ever want to get mad at mistakes.

Nearly four hours before tip-off of Game 4 of the WNBA Finals, Marqweesha “Marsh” Guthrie already had begun her commute to Barclays Center. She’s a longtime New York Liberty fan, going back to when she was a 6-year-old Jersey girl in awe watching ballers who looked like her play the game she loved. That passion still burns, and by the time I caught up with Marsh on Wednesday afternoon, she still sounded a bit hoarse from Sunday’s Game 3 experience. “I lost my voice in the second quarter,” she said, because in fandom rules, surrendering your larynx for your favorite team is always justifiable. For devotees such as Marsh, the league office couldn’t have scripted a better matchup. The defending champion Las Vegas Aces with their super-friends squad vs. the Liberty and all their stars playing in America’s largest media market. And this showdown, which concluded with Aces players sprinting down court at the buzzer, becoming  , appealed to basketball purists and celebrities alike. Tom Brady and LeBron James attended Game 1 in Vegas; James later shared a Marine Johannès highlight with   to his 52.7 million followers on X. When the series moved to Brooklyn for Games 3 and 4, Lil’ Kim, Fat Joe, Aubrey Plaza and Jason Sudeikis provided the star power. More than just courtside attention, the league and its network partners boasted about the rise in viewership after the opening three games of the Finals averaged 673,000 viewers on ABC and ESPN, the highest figure in two decades. But don’t get blinded by the shine of celebrities or be impressed by figures that have been cherry-picked to secure headlines. Rather, I’m rooting — and waiting — for this 27-year-old league to grow up and truly have its moment. This shouldn’t be a difficult ask — it’s happening elsewhere in women’s sports. A volleyball game in  , an attendance record for a women’s sporting event. An exhibition basketball game in   nearly doubling the previous record set for a single-game in women’s hoops. This momentum evidenced by sold-out football arenas hasn’t stopped at the gates. In March,   set the standard for women’s basketball ratings. The meeting between two powerhouse personalities in LSU’s Angel Reese and Iowa’s Caitlin Clark  , with the most-watched portion of the game peaking at 12.6 million. The WNBA, even with its dream matchup pitting A’ja Wilson, Kelsey Plum and Chelsea Gray (who missed Game 4 because of an injury) vs. Breanna Stewart, Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones, hasn’t come close to those kind of “wow” numbers. Even that spicy Game 4, played on a slow night in sports, with an MLB playoff game decided early,   which was less than pro wrestling, according to Nielsen data. The last time a WNBA Finals game averaged more than  . And for non-playoffs, the league has to search back to Candace Parker’s  as the only time a regular season game averaged at least a million viewers. If you’re thinking that seven-figure viewership is the Holy Grail that only a cultural earthquake can achieve, think again. This month, a  topped 1.8 million viewers. “[LSU-Iowa] totally changed the expectations for what that event can draw, going from 5 million for the championship game the previous year to 9.9 million. I don’t think even the most optimistic projection would’ve had 9.9 million,” said Jon Lewis, who covers ratings trends and the industry for  . “I would even bring in Colorado in college football, and nobody thought Colorado was going to start drawing the way that it does. That’s a shocker. So that is where you are seeing major league, meaningful, ‘this-changes-things’ kind of growth. The WNBA has not had the kind of growth that changes things yet.” The pinnacle game in college, of course, comes during a time when fans have been indoctrinated to care only about March Madness. So, the scheduling of the WNBA’s glamour event during the football season — with two of the four games airing right in the middle of NFL Sundays — has not helped the push for ratings. For years, it has been this way; Finals games air exclusively on ESPN and ABC, and because these networks do not broadcast NFL games on Sundays, they fill the void with the WNBA Finals. But when the media deal ends in 2025, the league could do itself a favor by negotiating more control over when and where its Finals games are scheduled. You know how bull riding got a million viewers? The event enjoyed the best warmup act possible — airing after an NFL game. Imagine giving the biggest stars of the WNBA that kind of football lead-in and the audience they could attract. Marsh, who purchased Liberty season tickets this year, can see progress, but she also has thoughts. The WNBA can grow in a major way, she believes, if the players become bigger household names. “We’re putting our games on ESPN at 3 o’clock, and we’re getting hundreds of thousands of people, and we’re competing with football,” Marsh said. “We have to believe as a society and a sports society that if we build the table, people will come and they will show up. . . . But access is key and marketing all year round.” The league has plenty of marketable stars — such as Wilson, the two-time MVP and 2023 Finals MVP. She has a winning brand and personality yet was not chosen as the   — that honor went to Ionescu. Wilson doesn’t have a signature shoe. Ionescu does. Her  didn’t even understand who should be the face of the league, first choosing a solo shot of Kelsey Plum, who went 2 for 12 from the field in Game 4, to post along with the final score. It’s not just wrong promotional choices. The WNBA is also dampening its own free publicity. This year, the league announced a new media policy — proposed by the players association — that ended locker room access. The decision was curious, in light of  expressing before the season that the throngs of media that came out to televise Brittney Griner’s first news conference should keep that same energy in covering all players. Professional reporters aren’t yahoos obsessed with watching athletes get dressed. Rather, inside those more intimate spaces, reporters do the work to build trust with the athletes they cover. And with that trust comes professional relationships — relationships that produce more nuanced and insightful pieces that reveal athletes as people. If any other league that matters attempted  , it would be rightly criticized. But female pro basketball players have largely received a pass. Which should be even more worrying because reporters  care about covering the WNBA with the same diligence as they would every other sport. Even when the Aces won the title Wednesday night, reporters were locked out of the locker room. It wasn’t until near midnight — almost two hours after the game and past deadline for many reporters — that the Aces invited media members in to the staging area held on the Liberty’s practice court. I think back to covering the Washington Mystics’ clincher in 2019 and writing about the La Marca prosecco flowing and the players dancing and lingering in long hugs, being their authentic, jubilant selves inside their locker rooms, and can’t believe players today would prevent those scenes from being captured for readers and fans. When teams cocoon themselves from the world, that’s a step backward. When the best player in the league gets second billing, even from her own team’s Instagram account, that stunts progress. When the games land in an unwinnable television slot, that slams the brakes during what should be an era of acceleration. Women’s sports are having a moment. Casual fans are out there, not just die-hards such as Marsh. When will this league decide it’s finally ready to find them?",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/10/19/wnba-finals-aces-liberty/,Washington Post,2023-10-19 09:40:00,
"Brissett shined in relief of Sam Howell, who was benched by Coach Ron Rivera after throwing his league-leading 15th interception to cap an ugly afternoon early in the fourth quarter. Rivera explained the move by saying he was “just trying to take care of” Howell, and he added that the second-year pro will remain Washington’s starter for next week’s game at the New York Jets. That’s the smart decision in a lost season, despite how much better the offense looked with Brissett under center than it did for the first three quarters of Sunday’s game.

That’s the smart decision in a lost season, despite how much better the offense looked with Brissett under center than it did for the first three quarters of Sunday’s game. Brissett, who hadn’t attempted a pass all season, immediately led a five-play, 67-yard touchdown drive that he capped with a 29-yard strike to Terry McLaurin. After the Commanders’ defense forced a rare three-and-out, Brissett led a second scoring march, and his three-yard touchdown pass on a fourth-down play after the two-minute warning pulled Washington within a score. The Commanders’ comeback bid came up short, but Brissett finished 8 for 10 for 124 yards. Jacoby to Curtis and it's a one-score game with 1:56 left 📺  : CBS  There were 4 minutes 47 seconds remaining after Brissett’s 49-yard completion to McLaurin gave Washington, which still trailed 28-14, first and goal at the Rams’ 1-yard line. The Commanders were stopped for no gain on consecutive running plays while demonstrating little sense of urgency. (Perhaps they are more interested in   than winning any more games.) An offensive pass interference penalty on tight end Logan Thomas negated a touchdown on the ensuing snap and forced Washington to burn even more time off the clock. It wasn’t until the third play after the two-minute warning that Brissett found Curtis Samuel for a touchdown. Despite having all three timeouts remaining, the Commanders attempted an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff, which failed. One week after being held without a catch for only the second time in his career, McLaurin had six catches for a career-high 141 yards. He also found the end zone for the third time this season and for the first time since Week 8. McLaurin caught three passes for 93 yards after Brissett entered the game. He nearly made an incredible one-handed catch on a deep ball from Howell in the third quarter, but the officials, who missed a blatant defensive pass interference penalty on the play, ruled McLaurin didn’t have control as he hit the ground. There’s a reason Terry McLaurin had only one available hand …  Two weeks ago, Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill ran right past Washington rookie safety Quan Martin on a 78-yard touchdown catch. On Sunday, Rams star wideout Cooper Kupp got similarly wide open against the Commanders’ perpetually confused secondary before stretching to pull in a 62-yard touchdown catch on Los Angeles’s second play of the second half. “I made that one a little tougher than it needed to be,”  , who, perhaps stunned not to see a defender within 15 yards of Kupp, nearly overthrew his best receiver. Kupp finished with eight catches for 111 yards. NINE AND DIME!   |   |    Washington’s defense, which had failed to force a turnover during the team’s four-game losing streak coming into Sunday’s game, had two takeaways in the first half against Los Angeles. They both came courtesy of fumbles by second-year running back Kyren Williams, who overcame his ball security issues to finish with 27 carries for 152 yards and a touchdown. Percy Butler and Benjamin St-Juste forced the fumbles, and Kendall Fuller and Kam Curl made the recoveries. The Commanders failed to turn either takeaway into points and have lost three straight games this season when winning the turnover battle. Washington was fortunate to be down only 13-0 at halftime — it was thoroughly outplayed through two quarters. The Rams converted 7 of 9 third-down opportunities in the first half and 9 of 16 in the game. The Commanders were 1 for 7 on third down in the first half and went three-and-out on three of their first five possessions. Los Angeles finished with 445 yards, the third-highest total allowed by Washington this season, and possessed the ball for nearly 36 minutes. As underdogs with nothing (except valuable draft position) to lose, the Commanders were more aggressive than usual on fourth down. For only the second time in Rivera’s four years at the helm, they had at least five fourth-down attempts. They converted three of them. On its second drive, Washington converted fourth and two at the Rams’ 45 after Howell stepped up in the pocket and found McLaurin for a 24-yard gain. Four plays later, Rivera passed up a short field goal attempt to go for it on fourth and short from the Rams’ 12, but Howell’s pass was batted down behind the line of scrimmage. Rivera didn’t completely let loose; trailing 20-0, the Commanders punted on fourth and five from the Los Angeles 44 early in the second half. Long snappers are fond of saying that their job is to remain anonymous, because when their name is mentioned, it’s most often because they screwed up. Every Washington fan knows long snapper Camaron Cheeseman’s name, and not only because it’s sort of fun to say. Cheeseman, who has struggled with his accuracy since training camp, had three more bad snaps Sunday, including a dribbler on a punt that nearly got punter Tress Way killed in the second quarter. “That’s not good enough, and we’re going to evaluate that,” Rivera said afterward. “I mean, I’ve been worried all year,”   when asked if he was concerned about the Commanders potentially making a change at his position. “I haven’t been performing the way I’ve been wanting to. Most places, I probably wouldn’t be around still.” Camaron Cheeseman had two bad snaps in the first half.

"NEW YORK — Many times this season, scoring just once or twice has been enough for the Washington Capitals. But they knew it wouldn’t stay that way for long, and against the New York Rangers on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, their scoring woes continued — while their four-game point streak did not. NEW YORK — Many times this season, scoring just once or twice has been enough for the Washington Capitals. But they knew it wouldn’t stay that way for long, and against the New York Rangers on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, their scoring woes continued — while their four-game point streak did not. Though the Capitals struck first, the Rangers poured in five unanswered goals to prevail, 5-1. In the Capitals’ first game since Saturday,  , Anthony Mantha had their lone goal and goaltender Darcy Kuemper made 26 saves. “We have to start scoring five-on-five if you’re going to be a quality team in this league,” Coach Spencer Carbery said. “We can defend. We can check. We’re detailed. We’re organized. But you’ve got to score. You have to find scoring. We just don’t have that right now.” Washington flew to New York early Wednesday morning. During the NHL’s Christmas break, teams are prohibited from having any activities — including traveling to their first game after the time off — from Dec. 24 to 26, which meant the Capitals had an early wake-up call to get on a plane while the Rangers went through a normal game-day morning at home. Both teams looked rusty, but the Capitals (17-10-5) kept pace in the first period despite having to kill an early penalty when defenseman John Carlson was boxed for hooking. Mantha opened the scoring at 4:12 of the second period with his fourth goal in the past three games; on the rush, he picked a corner above Rangers goalie Igor Shesterkin (26 saves). In 28 games, Mantha has equaled his total of 11 goals from last season, which he needed 67 games to score. He is second on the team in goals behind center Dylan Strome (13). The Rangers (24-8-1) wasted little time responding, and in a 5:45 stretch of the period New York pulled away. K’Andre Miller tied the score at 7:03, Artemi Panarin scored the go-ahead goal on the power play at 12:08, and Braden Schneider made it 3-1 just 40 seconds later on a long-range shot that fooled Kuemper through traffic. “I think we were kind of taking it to them,” Capitals winger Tom Wilson said. “The game looked pretty good from our end. We get a big goal. They get one, and then those next few minutes there are big. When their building kind of wakes up and they get feeling good about their game, it’s a tough team to chase from behind. That’s not the ideal game plan. No excuses. It was a long day, but we’ve got to find ways to manage those parts of games a little bit better.” Washington   the previous time the teams met, turning in what Carbery termed his team’s most complete effort of the season in a 4-0 home win Dec. 9. The second time around, the Eastern Conference-leading Rangers gave the Capitals the pushback they expected earlier this month — and Washington couldn’t keep up. It wasn’t as comprehensive of an effort as the Capitals showed in the teams’ first meeting, but once the Rangers got rolling, they didn’t look back. Washington had a few opportunities to get back in the game — including several shots that hit the post and a chance for rookie Ivan Miroshnichenko that required a highlight-reel save by Shesterkin — but the Rangers’ waves of pressure kept Washington from building much momentum. “They’re one of the best teams in the league right now,” Wilson said. “Any team at home, when they get up a couple goals, it’s not ideal. You’ve got to start taking chances on the other side of the puck. You’ve got to start pushing a little bit, and they’re good in transition. They can make you pay when the puck’s not bouncing your way.” On the shift after Miroshnichenko was stopped by Shesterkin, Miller scored again to give New York a three-goal lead with 13:06 to play. The Capitals had scored four or more goals in just nine of their 31 games entering Wednesday, and their already-long odds of staging a comeback decreased when Alexis Lafrenière scored just over five minutes later; the Capitals had scored five or more goals just twice. Seeking a late spark, Carbery shifted Alex Ovechkin to skate with Miroshnichenko and center Evgeny Kuznetsov, and the all-Russian line created several scoring chances. But as has been the case so often for the Capitals this season, those scoring chances didn’t produce a goal as they continue to be hamstrung by their limited offensive production. “It makes it really, really challenging when you’re held to one, two goals every night,” Carbery said. “Similar tonight. Did some really good things early in that game, and then put ourselves behind the eight-ball. For our group, it’s really, really challenging when we get down in games.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/27/capitals-rangers-blowout/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 22:41:00,
"Bowl season continues this week with a slew of games. Here’s how I think a few of them could play out. Texas State is playing in its first bowl game, while Rice isn’t a team that’s particularly accustomed to the postseason and is making just its seventh bowl appearance since the early 1960s. I think both will celebrate the occasion by scoring a bunch of points. Bowl season continues this week with a slew of games. Here’s how I think a few of them could play out. Texas State is playing in its first bowl game, while Rice isn’t a team that’s particularly accustomed to the postseason and is making just its seventh bowl appearance since the early 1960s. I think both will celebrate the occasion by scoring a bunch of points. Even though Owls quarterback JT Daniels announced his retirement after the end of the regular season, Rice should be in good shape with AJ Padgett under center. The Owls pass the ball 57.46 percent of the time (14th in the nation) and should find success against a Bobcats passing defense that ranks   in expected points allowed per play. Texas State’s offense is much more balanced and should also be able to move the ball against a middle-of-the-pack Rice defense. Another reason to think about the over here is that both offenses tend to make the most of their productive drives. Rice’s offense ranks fifth in points per   (a drive that results in a first down inside an opponent’s 40-yard line or a big-play touchdown), while Texas State ranks 14th. Both defenses allow plenty of productive drives as well: The Owls are 114th in Eckel rate, and the Bobcats are 122nd.  over 60. The question isn’t who has left Texas A&M since the end of the regular season. It’s who  . The   after 10 games. Then, after Texas A&M wrapped up a 7-5 regular season, 11 starters left via the transfer portal or opted out to stay healthy for the NFL draft. Among them: starting quarterback Max Johnson, wide receivers Ainias Smith and Evan Stewart (Nos. 1 and 2 on the team in receptions and receiving yards), three starting defensive backs, four from the defensive front seven and two starting offensive linemen. In essence, the Aggies will be fielding a team of mostly backups. Oklahoma State’s personnel losses — almost entirely backups — are comparatively light. Most importantly, running back Ollie Gordon II   he would return to Oklahoma State in 2024 after averaging 124.2 rushing yards and scoring 20 touchdowns on the ground (both No. 2 in the country). Overall, Texas A&M was pretty good against the run (No. 4 in success rate), but the Aggies still had a tendency to allow big gains (No. 53 in runs of 10-plus yards allowed), and that was with all those now-departed starters on the field. No running back in the Football Bowl Subdivision had more rushing gains of at least 20 yards than Gordon,  . The Cowboys are 6-1 against the spread in their past seven bowl games under Coach Mike Gundy, who apparently has found the secret to keeping his team motivated for these games. They’re also 22-10 against the spread in their past 32 games as underdogs since 2016,   in the nation over that span. They should get it done again against depleted Texas A&M.  Oklahoma State +2 On the one hand, Boston College gets to play its bowl game only about four miles up Beacon Street at Fenway Park. On the other hand is … everything else. SMU is coming off an upset of Tulane in the American Athletic Conference championship game, a game it won without usual starting quarterback Preston Stone, who suffered a season-ending broken leg in the Mustangs’ penultimate game against Navy. Backup Kevin Jennings threw two interceptions against the Green Wave, but SMU’s defense — which has been salty all season — held Tulane to 4.34 yards per play, its second-worst mark of the season. Jennings should have much more success against a Boston College team that has lost three straight and features one of the worst Power Five defenses in the country, allowing 6.55 yards per play (123rd nationally). The Eagles also will be without three starters in the secondary because of injuries and transfers. Boston College’s rushing attack, led by quarterback Thomas Castellanos, has been able to move the ball, but SMU enters with the eighth-ranked rushing defense in terms of opponent success rate. To top everything off, Boston College is a six-win team with  . The Eagles beat Holy Cross of the Football Championship Subdivision by just three points Sept. 9, allowing a horrid 7.4 yards per play and only sealing the win when the Crusaders fumbled at the BC 29-yard line with just over a minute left. The Eagles also scored consecutive three-point wins over Virginia (in a game they trailed 21-7 at halftime) and Army (in a game in which they scored the winning touchdown with 25 seconds left). They’re extremely lucky to be bowling.

"SAN FRANCISCO — Jordan Poole didn’t spend long enough with Golden State to become synonymous with the Warriors, but that doesn’t mean four formative seasons inside that machine didn’t leave an indelible mark. Moving on has been shaky. It was plain to see that Poole still feels at home at Chase Center when he spent an extended period of time warming up Friday night in his first return to his old stomping grounds since Golden State traded him to Washington this summer. The result was a 129-118 Warriors win. SAN FRANCISCO — Jordan Poole didn’t spend long enough with Golden State to become synonymous with the Warriors, but that doesn’t mean four formative seasons inside that machine didn’t leave an indelible mark. Moving on has been shaky. It was plain to see that Poole still feels at home at Chase Center when he spent an extended period of time warming up Friday night in his first return to his old stomping grounds since Golden State traded him to Washington this summer. The result was a 129-118 Warriors win. His hood up, Poole remained in front of the crowd pregame for longer than his normal warm-up, either soaking in the adoration from the early-bird fans or preparing for a battle against his old team — or perhaps a little of both. A child handed him a poem he had composed and asked Poole to sign it. He beamed when the Warriors showed him on the big screen by way of welcoming him back before tip-off. After the game, he stuck around to greet friends and fans, taking a picture with one who burst into tears after having her picture taken with the fifth-year veteran. “It’s pretty special, I mean, just [having] people be so emotional about that. Kind of shows my impact that I had here, which is really cool, especially starting off my career early at the highest level, win a championship, play with a lot of Hall of Famers,” Poole said. “But I really embraced Dub Nation, submerged myself with them throughout my tenure here, and it’s pretty special to see I got the love back.” It would be hard to blame Poole for wanting to bask in memories of his glory days. Stephen Curry paced the Warriors on Friday with 30 points, including eight three-pointers, and Jonathan Kuminga had 22. Washington surrendered 18 three-pointers overall and fell to 5-23. Washington’s Kyle Kuzma (seven points, nine rebounds) exited the game in the third quarter with right knee soreness and did not return. For his part, Poole continued a strong recent scoring surge with 25 points on 7-of-21 shooting, including three three-pointers. Still, the 24-year-old guard has spent his first three months as a Washington Wizard playing some of the ugliest basketball of his career, given his championship résumé. His numbers are the lowest they have been since before he established himself as a key member of Golden State’s rotation ahead of the 2021-22 season, his third year in the NBA — he entered Friday averaging 17.2 points and 3.6 assists in 26 games. His shooting has seen a bigger dip, at 41.2 percent from the field and 31.7 percent from the three-point line. That’s better than only his rookie season. Statistics hardly tell the tale of his glum body language after errors, his off timing and loose handle on offense. In Thursday’s win over the Portland Trail Blazers, he flailed so egregiously on one play that he was called for a flop with 3:28 left to play and assessed a technical foul. Poole is well aware he is having a rough adjustment period. Off the court, there is no issue. He is a well-liked member of the Wizards’ locker room, a player whom teammates laud for his work ethic, earnest desire to improve and lighthearted demeanor. But on the court, Poole knows precisely why things aren’t going as he would like them to. He is having a hard time getting the Warriors out of his system — and no, he doesn’t mean the lingering effects of   in October 2022. “Everything that I’ve been taught is the opposite here,” Poole said in a recent interview. “ … That’s the transition part. It’s like I’m rewiring my mind to translate to a new situation.” As it turns out, Poole has found that spending four seasons working to fit cleanly inside the Warriors’ unique offensive system has made it hard for him to adjust to something new. “The looks that I’m getting here are completely different,” he said. “Coming from Golden State, they were such a unique offense. It took a little bit of time to get that figured out.” He explains it like this: As he learned how to function as an NBA player, he didn’t play alongside a four-man or five-man who shot the ball much. Golden State’s offense flows through its guards, which opened what felt like endless shot opportunities and fostered a feeling of offensive freedom. Playing alongside Stephen Curry certainly didn’t hurt. “If a regular four-man shoots nine shots and a regular center shoots nine times, that’s 18 shots,” Poole said. “Now, you divide those 18 shots between three guards, that’s an extra six shots. So you maybe don’t have to know where your specific shots are because you’ll get a different set of looks, and you’ll know that opportunities will come back just through the rhythm of the offense. “[In Washington], we got more people bringing up the ball. We got everybody pushing the pace. We got guys who post up — we [in Golden State] didn’t have any post-up players other than [Andrew Wiggins].” With the Wizards, Poole is learning how to operate around forwards Kyle Kuzma, Deni Avdija and Danilo Gallinari, all of whom do get their work done in the post. He is doing all of this while facing more targeted defense than he ever did with Golden State, where he played within an offense whose specialty was scrambling defenses. Wizards point guard Tyus Jones said that has resulted in Poole overthinking his role in the offense and fretting about when his next shot is coming. After two of Poole’s best performances this season — a season-high-tying   on Dec. 15 and a 28-point performance featuring a career-high-tying   — Jones said both times Poole’s success was because he struck the right balance between patiently waiting for his shots and being aggressive in getting to the rim. Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr. agreed finding that harmony is the key for Poole. “I still think he’s feeling that balance of being a lead guard at times versus playing off the ball. You think about Tyus, who’s proven to be very deliberate in his execution . . . then you add Kuz and Deni who are more grab-and-go, which for our team, it’s been terrific,” Unseld said. “So it’s been a balance of slowing it down and getting certain guys the ball at certain times and facilitating versus: ‘Here’s a guy. Get it to him and push. Now we play.’ I think he’s kind of feeling that out, too, and I think it takes some time to get comfortable.” That’s just the offense. On defense, Poole gives an example of the type of mind rewiring he is referring to when he talks about adjusting in Washington. Both Golden State and Michigan, where he played college ball for two seasons, sent defenders baseline, while the Wizards send their players more to the middle of the action. “I was taught not to get backdoor cut so I would be below my man. But our team principles are to be up and fill gaps and trust that if somebody gets back door, you get help,” Poole said. “That’s different for me, and it’s going to take a little time to get naturally comfortable with it.” To be clear, Poole doesn’t sound as if he is complaining when he is talking about these schematic differences, more like he is stating facts. The 24-year-old’s belief in Washington’s rebuild is obvious. When he speaks about working with assistant coach David Vanterpool, whom he sits next to on the bench during games and whose mentorship he sought because of Vanterpool’s track record molding guards such as Damian Lillard, Poole mentions another difference between Washington and his experience with the Warriors. Poole spent the past four seasons drilling what he was good at. With the Wizards, he is trying to shore up weaknesses. “More so practicing for what’s coming than what it is — for, like, in three years, two years, when we’re in the playoffs,” Poole said. “That’s what I mean about rewiring my brain. Prior, everything was right in front of us. It was, ‘If you don’t win this game right now, we’re not going to win the Finals,’ type of vibe. Now I’m practicing and planning for what’s coming.” Poole sees himself as a leader in that future he and his team are manifesting, which means the new information he is trying to absorb on offense and defense is coexisting in his brain with things such as being aware of his teammates’ feelings and what to say — if anything — during timeouts. Just as he ingratiated himself with Warriors fans, he takes a burgeoning role in the D.C. community just as seriously. While he admits he hasn’t had the time during the breakneck pace of the season to participate in as many events as he would like, Poole beams when talking about the community work he has done. Last week, he presented Ben’s Chili Bowl founder Virginia Ali with her own bobblehead at Ali’s 90th birthday party at Lincoln Theater. Jordan Poole stopped by Virginia Ali's 90th birthday celebration yesterday to present her with her bobblehead. 🎂🫶  He studied a packet of details on Ali’s family and the history of Ben’s Chili Bowl in the days leading into the event, composed a speech and sat with Monumental Basketball senior vice president John Thompson III, a family friend of Ali’s, to fill in any information gaps beforehand. “It was a really, really dope experience,” Poole said. “It was just cool to meet her and see how good she looked. She’s just done so much for the city.” That element of the move to Washington — connecting with people in the city and his teammates — has been the smoothest part of Poole’s adjustment. Although the guard clearly gets frustrated on the court during what’s been a challenging season, he said he isn’t frustrated by the process. He has been through this before. It took about two years for Poole to find his groove with Golden State. “You’ve got to just keep going, every day. The plan is the plan,” Poole said. “Someone just told me that the other day, and I kind of like it. Everything will pan itself out, you know? You’ve just got to keep doing what you’re doing as long as you’re doing it with the right intent, which I believe in 100 percent. It’s just a matter of time.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/22/jordan-poole-wizards-warriors/,Washington Post,2023-12-23 02:11:00,
"By international standards, MLS is not a normal soccer league. There is a salary cap and no promotion and relegation. There are drafts, trades, conferences and playoffs — elements foreign to the sport globally. The league scoffs at international breaks. Severe weather demands a winter offseason instead of a traditional summer break. By international standards, MLS is not a normal soccer league. There is a salary cap and no promotion and relegation. There are drafts, trades, conferences and playoffs — elements foreign to the sport globally. The league scoffs at international breaks. Severe weather demands a winter offseason instead of a traditional summer break. Being different did not stop record attendance this year, a blockbuster broadcast deal and the arrival of Lionel Messi. The 29-team circuit is doing just fine. And amid all the quirks, the league does observe most soccer conventions. Since its birth in 1996, MLS has participated in a 110-year-old national tournament, the U.S. Open Cup, that has involved amateurs   and first-tier sides owned by billionaires. But in a late-day news dump Friday,   it will skip the tournament next year. Like a child throwing a sandbox tantrum, MLS is taking its toys and going home. Commissioner Don Garber has grumbled about the Open Cup for years, but no one expected him to lead a full-scale exodus. The league has not completely cut ties: It will send developmental squads from MLS Next Pro, its self-created third division. The Seattle Sounders, for instance, will be represented by the Tacoma Defiance — a fitting team name under the circumstances. Such action is the equivalent of the Premier League clubs en masse ditching the FA Cup and entering their under-21 squads. Venting on social media, some MLS fans fumed about the league thumbing its nose at tradition, while those who support smaller clubs seethed about losing the chance to beat the big boys in a single-game, knockout competition. So why did MLS withdraw? In Friday’s news release, the league said the Open Cup would “provide emerging professional players with additional opportunities for meaningful competition.” Many MLS teams call up young players for the competition, the league reasoned, so why not use a squad full of them? The other reason cited by the league rang truer: “The move also benefits the MLS regular season by reducing schedule congestion, freeing up to six midweek match dates.” In other words, the calendar is full and something had to go. But MLS created the congestion by launching a massive new tournament that no one asked for. The   involves all 47 MLS and Mexican Liga MX clubs and consumes four summer weeks. MLS has long been obsessed with tapping into the Mexican American market, and the Leagues Cup is the latest vehicle in that vein. The tournament also provided more live content for MLS’s broadcast partner, Apple TV Plus, which is paying up to $2.5 billion over 10 years; MLS doesn’t own Open Cup broadcast rights. Aside from the Leagues Cup, MLS’s docket includes the 34-game regular season, the playoffs and the All-Star Game. Early next year, 10 MLS teams will compete in the   (formerly called the Concacaf Champions League), the annual regional championship modeled after the famed European competition. MLS schedule-makers also must take into account large-scale international events held in the United States, such as the 2024 Copa América, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, probably the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup and the 2026 World Cup. It’s a lot, so MLS unloaded the Open Cup. It hasn’t ruled out returning. “MLS remains committed to working with [the U.S. Soccer Federation] to evolve and elevate the Open Cup for everyone involved in the years ahead,” the league said. To be fair, the Open Cup is a flawed tournament. Conceptually, it seems like a winner. Practically, it has sputtered in the shadows. Some MLS teams move early-round home games to smaller, alternative venues because, until the late stages, ticket demand is low. Managing a busy schedule and a tight roster, coaches often hold out regulars in favor of reserves and prospects. Some non-MLS venues are substandard. The financial rewards are small. TV coverage is limited, and a confusing number of online platforms show matches. The tournament just means much more to the lower divisions than to MLS. In May, Garber   and its organizer, U.S. Soccer, the sport’s domestic governing body. “From our perspective,” Garber said during a USSF board of directors meeting, “it is a very poor reflection on what it is we’re trying to do with soccer at the highest level.” Despite its flaws, the Open Cup offers something MLS doesn’t: consequences and charm. Without fear of relegation and with a low threshold for making the playoffs, the MLS regular season is monotonous. The Open Cup is more like the NCAA basketball tournament — if the NCAA were to invite teams from all three of its divisions, plus NAIA schools. A lower-division club packs a humble park and hosts a muscular visitor. A journeyman who dreams of an MLS contract scores a once-in-a-lifetime goal from great distance. A goalkeeper who plays soccer as a side hustle makes the clinching save in a shootout. These are the moments that help make soccer so appealing in much of the world. It’s Grimsby Town, from England’s fourth flight, pulling off five upsets against higher-tier opponents, including Southampton of the Premier League, to reach the   this past spring. It’s third-division Union Omaha advancing to the Open Cup quarterfinals in 2022 and second-tier Sacramento Republic playing for the title the same year. It’s D.C. United   amid a 3-24-7 regular season. That was the most recent of United’s three Open Cup titles, which rank fourth among MLS teams. Because United is the only U.S.-based organization yet to launch a MLS Next Pro team — it has plans to do so in Baltimore — D.C. will have no presence in the 2024 tournament. Since 1996, only one non-MLS team has lifted the trophy. The Rochester Rhinos, now defunct, sprung from the second division in 1999. But that misses the point. The journey and the storylines make the Open Cup special — and make soccer like no other. MLS, though, has put its own self-interests ahead of the game at large. For that, Garber and the league deserve a red card.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/18/mls-us-open-cup-decision/,Washington Post,2023-12-18 10:05:00,
"The Maryland Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday reinstated a member of the state’s Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention who had been  over social media posts about the Israeli government’s military actions in  , saying in a statement that the office lacked the authority to remove her. The Maryland Attorney General’s Office on Wednesday reinstated a member of the state’s Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention who had been  over social media posts about the Israeli government’s military actions in  , saying in a statement that the office lacked the authority to remove her. Zainab Chaudry, director of the Maryland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), returned to her role roughly two weeks after Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown (D) swiftly suspended her, deeming her social media posts “disruptive” to the hate-crime panel’s work. “Upon further review, it was determined that the law establishing the Commission directs the Attorney General to appoint members to a 4-year fixed term but does not provide the Attorney General the authority to remove a Commissioner before the expiration of their term nor the authority to suspend a Commissioner during their term of service,” a Brown spokesperson said in a statement issued Wednesday. Chaudry is part of a 22-member panel created by the General Assembly earlier this year to combat escalating incidents of hate crimes recorded by the state in recent years, according to Maryland State Police, which compiles the data. She was appointed to the commission by Brown as the designee from CAIR, which, like other groups including the Anti-Defamation League, the Baltimore Jewish Council and the NAACP, is guaranteed representation on the body. Brown faced intense pressure to act last month as state lawmakers called for Chaudry’s removal. In the Nov. 21 statement announcing her suspension, Brown called the decision a “first test” with deep implications for a body that “must serve as a model for the entire State on how to respond to incidents of hate and bias.” Chaudry at the time said she was being held to a different standard than other members of the panel. “We welcome Attorney General Anthony G. Brown’s decision to reinstate the appointment,” Edward Ahmed Mitchell, deputy director of CAIR’s national office, said  . “We also appreciate the productive conversations we have held with Attorney General Brown and his staff over the past few weeks. We agree that it is important for the commission to collaboratively develop additional guidelines and we look forward to upholding those guidelines, which must apply consistently to all commissioners.” Del. Joe Vogel (D-Montgomery), who sponsored the bill to create the commission, said he plans to introduce legislation for the 2024 session that would give the attorney general the authority to remove and suspend commissioners based on a set code of conduct. Vogel said he does not think that the commission, which is scheduled to meet next week, should convene until the attorney general has the new authority. “I don’t think we should give a platform for more hate to be espoused through this commission,” he said. In one post, Chaudry directly compared Israel to Nazi Germany — a juxtaposition widely seen as antisemitic — with the caption, “That moment when you become what you hated most.” She said she could have included more context with that imagery, but she did not retract the sentiment. “There are very chilling parallels between what we see occurring in Gaza with other very disturbing, terrifying moments in our world’s history,” Chaudry told The Washington Post last month during an interview. Reached by email on Wednesday, Chaudry said: “Eradicating hate bias requires examining and working to fix injustices and protecting the rights for all our diverse communities. My focus has been to consistently and unapologetically advocate for Maryland’s Muslim, Palestinian and Arab communities, and all those who face intolerance, dehumanization, erasure and censorship. That has not changed.” An increasingly bitter debate has been playing out across college campuses, on social media and among Democratic voters over the conflict and the U.S. response to it.   has come   from liberal members of his party for the administration’s support of the Israeli military operation. And as the war continues,   show a splintering in the party, with young voters and  increasingly   with Palestinians. About 80 percent of Gaza’s population of more than 2 million has been displaced, according to the United Nations, as Israeli forces continue responding to an Oct. 7 attack by   militants. After Brown announced Chaudry’s reinstatement, Ron Halber, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington, called for her to resign. “Ms. Chaudry remains a divisive and polarizing presence on the commission, which dramatically undermines its ability to carry out its critical mission,” Halber said. Before the commission’s Dec. 13 meeting, Brown plans to distribute draft operating guidelines for review by the body that address balancing a member’s right to freedom of speech and the role of a commissioner. “The draft guidelines will emphasize that appointees to the Maryland Hate Crimes Commission are public officials charged with specific roles and responsibilities under State law,” the attorney general’s office said in its statement. “In accepting these positions, appointees assume an obligation to put their own interests aside when coming to the table to serve as advisers on matters of such great public importance.” The commission has had only one meeting since it was formed. Minutes before the commission adjourned its first and only meeting in September, Chaudry, one of the more outspoken members of the panel during the nearly 90-minute meeting, expressed an eagerness to jump in, describing the commission’s charge to find ways to prevent hate and bias incidents as one of her priorities. “I’m really excited. This is a long time in the making,” she told the panel, noting her organization’s push to advance the bill that created the commission. “I think the diversity here in this space is really important because it reflects so many different communities to deal with hate bias. And I just can’t wait to get to work.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/06/maryland-hate-commission-reinstated-cair/,Washington Post,2023-12-06 18:15:00,

In 2017, U.S. Circuit Judge William H. Pryor Jr. was   for the first Supreme Court vacancy   got to fill. On Monday, Pryor delivered a stinging rebuke of Trump’s former chief of staff in a key   case. He might also have undermined Trump’s claims to presidential immunity in Trump’s federal Jan. 6 case. The ruling came as both the   and   could be headed to a conservative-leaning Supreme Court where Trump nominees fill three of nine slots. And it served as a timely reminder of how even many Republican- and Trump-nominated judges have taken a dim view of Trump and his allies’ efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday  former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows’s effort to get his Fulton County, Ga., criminal case “removed” to federal court. Meadows argued that he had been acting in his official capacity during the course of events relevant to the indictment, and thus was entitled to a change of venue. The three-judge panel unanimously rejected Meadows’s claim. Just as notable as the judgment was the author of the ruling — Pryor, a judge so conservative that his Supreme Court prospects appear to have been harmed by his   — and what he said about Meadows’s actions. Pryor wrote that Meadows’s effort failed not just because former officials can’t get cases removed to federal court, but also because Meadows’s political actions wouldn’t have qualified his case for removal anyway. In the course of making that case, Pryor repeatedly alluded to the concept of Meadows seeking to interfere in the election results. Sometimes it was discussed as an allegation. But at other points that careful caveat wasn’t there: You could read those sections as describing the allegations against Meadows rather than directly accusing him of something. But referring to election “interference” and Meadows’s attempt to “infiltrate” (a  ) Cobb County’s process seems like a choice. Perhaps most significant, the ruling in its own words describes Georgia’s election results as “valid” — an adjective that wouldn’t seem to be strictly necessary in this context but is something Trump to this day wrongly disputes. Also potentially significant in the ruling is what it might say about Trump’s claims to presidential immunity in his federal election-subversion case. Trump’s lawyers have signaled that they will argue Trump has immunity because his actions  , which states that a president’s duty is to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” But Pryor wrote that Meadows presented “no legal authority for the proposition that the President’s power extends to ‘assess[ing] the conduct of state officials.’” Then he gets to the line about “interference.” “We are aware of no authority suggesting that the Take Care Clause empowers federal executive interference with state election procedures based solely on the federal executive’s own initiative,” Pryor wrote, “and not in relation to another branch’s constitutionally-authorized act.” While not binding on the Supreme Court, that reading from a conservative judge might signal that Trump shouldn’t try  to fall back on such an argument for immunity. The Meadows ruling is hardly the first example of a Republican-nominated judge ruling against Trump’s side in a case with some proximity to the matters ahead. With judges ruling nearly unanimously against Trump’s and his allies’ lawsuits after the 2020 election, The Washington Post conducted an analysis finding that, by mid-December 2020,   — about 44 percent.

"NASHVILLE — The first blockbuster trade of the baseball offseason came Wednesday as teams began packing up their suites at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and braced for a winter spent making deals from across the country instead of across the resort. The deal, finalized shortly before midnight, centered around three-time all-star Juan Soto, who was sent from the San Diego Padres to the New York Yankees with defense-first center fielder Trent Grisham. In return, the Padres received young right-handed pitchers Michael King, Jhony Brito and Randy Vasquez (all of whom have major league experience), catcher Kyle Higashioka and right-handed pitching prospect Drew Thorpe. NASHVILLE — The first blockbuster trade of the baseball offseason came Wednesday as teams began packing up their suites at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and braced for a winter spent making deals from across the country instead of across the resort. The deal, finalized shortly before midnight, centered around three-time all-star Juan Soto, who was sent from the San Diego Padres to the New York Yankees with defense-first center fielder Trent Grisham. In return, the Padres received young right-handed pitchers Michael King, Jhony Brito and Randy Vasquez (all of whom have major league experience), catcher Kyle Higashioka and right-handed pitching prospect Drew Thorpe. The move for Soto, a 25-year-old outfielder due to hit free agency after the 2024 season, signals a change in posture for both franchises. The Yankees, who have been less willing to jump at available stars in recent years than in their decorated past, look to be aggressive again after finishing fourth in the American League East and missing the playoffs. The Padres, who have spent freely on stars in recent years despite a modest market size, appear determined to lower payroll now — and perhaps for years to come. Soto, the former Washington Nationals standout who was a key part of  , was already a rarity among young superstars since his call-up in 2018, when he was still a teenager. A four-time Silver Slugger, Soto has walked more than any player through his age-24 season. (He turned 25 on Oct. 25.) He has more homers (160) through that age than all but eight players in history — and the same number as future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols. And now he has already been traded twice — perhaps the most surprising part of his résumé. In San Diego, as in Washington, the cost of signing Soto to an extension became simply too expensive. His agent, Scott Boras, is expected to seek a long-term deal for Soto worth about $400 million. The Padres, whose fearless and free-spending owner, Peter Seidler, died last month, decided they need money for starting pitching now and to rein in their still-substantial payroll for later. The Nationals made a similar calculation when  , a deal that brought them a haul of prospects and signaled the start of their rebuild. In part because of the meteoric numbers he compiled in his Nationals tenure, in part because he never quite seemed to be the same on or off the field in San Diego, the two years he spent as a Padre will probably be remembered as both very good and disappointing. He hit .265 — 30 points below his career mark — in 214 games, with slugging percentages and OPSes that still qualified as elite but that were also more than 50 points lower than his career numbers. People familiar with his Padres tenure said Soto also changed off the field in San Diego, preferring to do his hitting alone and out of sight, becoming harder for coaches and others to reach than he had been in Washington. But those familiar with his thinking said this week that Soto was open to a long-term future in San Diego if team and player could find a financial fit. They couldn’t and — like the Nationals before them — the Padres made sure to get something for him while they could. The move was the second the Yankees made in 24 hours. On Tuesday night, they acquired outfielder Alex Verdugo from the Red Sox in a deal that provides outfield depth while betting on Verdugo to produce before becoming a free agent next offseason. And they are pursuing Japanese ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto to bolster an aging rotation. The Yankees, who flirted with the AL East basement last season, have become the early leaders in terms of offseason additions in what is traditionally a loaded division. But the Toronto Blue Jays are pursuing Shohei Ohtani. The Baltimore Orioles signed closer Craig Kimbrel to a one-year deal reportedly worth $13 million, making him the Orioles’ biggest free agent signing since Chris Davis. But so far, the Yankees are acting like the Yankees of old this offseason, and by pairing Soto with slugging Aaron Judge in the heart of a suddenly formidable order, they might start looking like it next summer, too.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/06/juan-soto-traded-new-york-yankees/,Washington Post,2023-12-06 23:23:00,
"The blue tarp covering the new street sign finally fell and the crowd erupted. They had waited years to see Marion Barry Avenue rise — a name that reflected their pride in being Black Washingtonians, hope for the future of their neighborhood and resolve in cementing a shared history for future generations. The blue tarp covering the new street sign finally fell and the crowd erupted. They had waited years to see Marion Barry Avenue rise — a name that reflected their pride in being Black Washingtonians, hope for the future of their neighborhood and resolve in cementing a shared history for future generations. For those gathered in Anacostia on Saturday, Marion Barry Jr., the four-term D.C. mayor  , is their “mayor for life.” People celebrating the new street name said Barry still looms large in their lives. They called him a mentor who taught them how to use local government to advocate for their communities. He gave them their first summer jobs through a program he launched in 1979 and one that continues today. Some said they tell their children about him, teaching about his accomplishments alongside figures like Martin Luther King Jr. Now the street bearing his name will intersect with Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, in a section of the city that includes what was the heart of his political base as mayor and on the D.C. Council. “It’s reclaiming a piece of D.C.,” J.R. Clark, 57, who grew up in the District and lives in Ward 7, said during the celebration Saturday. “It’s reclaiming our history and not letting others define who our leadership is and who our heroes are in our community.” Barry was the  of his generation. He created new opportunities for Black people, elevating them to city government positions, and created programs that helped people who needed it the most: food for seniors, home-buying assistance for the working class and summer jobs for youth. He found supporters in racial justice advocates in the NAACP and everyday folks who benefited from the social services he championed. Even after he served a jail sentence when the FBI caught him   on camera in a 1990 sting at the Vista Hotel, he came back to win a fourth term as mayor. In the , he was viewed favorably by 81 percent of Black Washingtonians, and just 7 percent of White people. Barry proudly  “Chocolate City,” a moniker bestowed when D.C. was majority Black. The years-long grass-roots effort to rename this major thoroughfare in Southeast Washington included  , letters to the D.C. Council and a push from council member Trayon White Sr. (D), who represents Barry’s home of Ward 8. And it came during a time of communities across the country reexamining the past and pushing to change the names of public spaces to more fully represent the diversity of America. The roots of the road’s previous name, Good Hope Road,  to the 19th century when renowned abolitionist and statesman Frederick Douglass lived in Anacostia. Some in the neighborhood questioned changing the name of a street that  their community through so many generations and complained to the D.C. Council of potential logistical complications. Still, the council this year  the legislation, which was backed by Barry’s widow, Cora Masters Barry. Many on Saturday said they thought calling this road, the entrance to Anacostia, after a man who fought hard for this often overlooked part of D.C. was a perfect fit. “To me, this is it,” Masters Barry said. “He’s alive. You’ll call his name all day. A thousand times a day people will be saying, ‘Marion Barry. Marion Barry.’” At a block party celebration, people waved signs that said: “It’s A Great Day To Live in Ward 8,” uplifting a community too often defined by challenges such as poverty, underinvestment and gun violence. The area  at least 89 homicides by mid-November, by far the most of any ward. The hundreds of people gathered Saturday heard from speakers including Masters Barry, White, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D) and Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D). They watched videos of Barry’s career, hugged longtime friends and shared memories of the former mayor and the difference he made in their lives. “He would be the first to tell you that he was the champion for the last, the lost and the least. But he would also tell you that he transformed every ward of Washington, D.C.,” Bowser said from the stage. “Marion Barry challenges us to do more, to be bigger, to get up when we’ve been knocked down and to show the world who we are as Washingtonians and who we are as people.” The city has continued to honor his legacy over the years. His statue stands on Pennsylvania Avenue NW outside the Wilson Building. The office building at One Judiciary Square was named the Marion S. Barry Jr. Building. The summer youth employment program he championed has his name, too. Yolanda Armstrong, 42, arrived early to snag one of the few seats in front of the stage. She stood in front of her chair, dancing to go-go music and cheering in anticipation for what the day would bring. She said she got her first job from Barry, working in customer service at an office. Now she works for Marty’s Food and Catering, a community catering business that provides food for people in need. Armstrong, of Southeast Washington, is a fourth-generation Washingtonian who credits Barry with paving the way for other Black people in this city to find professional success and ascend to the highest levels of local government. Armstrong’s children, she said, “know who Marion Barry is, they know President [Barack] Obama, they know the mayor.” “He was the blueprint. Everything from the street that you walk to the restaurants you eat at, the jobs, the buildings, he's the steppingstone for everything,” she said. “It makes me feel so good to see recognition for someone I knew was bright and brilliant and gave us opportunities” As Tatum Primus, 16, a former D.C. youth deputy mayor, walked up to the stage Saturday to honor a man she never met, she thought about how Barry would be distraught by the current gun violence. Primus, who wants to be a defense attorney one day, shared a poem she wrote that she hoped would speak out against this crisis in a way that honored the late mayor. “Oh, D.C., violence only leads to more pain and despair, leaving wounds that are deep and hearts that can’t be repaired,” she said from the stage. “We must put the guns down and rise above this ugly strife. And reclaim the city’s spirit, its true vibrant and chocolate life.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/18/marion-barry-good-hope-dc-anacostia/,Washington Post,2023-11-18 19:19:00,

Sam Altman is best known as the chief executive of OpenAI — the pioneering artificial intelligence company that has turned him into one of Silicon Valley’s most powerful people. But before that, Altman was known as one of the tech industry’s most prolific angel investors, making dozens of investments in a range of companies focused on extending life to building fusion reactors. Now, his sprawling web of investments in start-ups is facing fresh scrutiny, as some of them do business with OpenAI or could benefit from preferential access to OpenAI’s technology. Since 2010, Altman has personally invested in 125 companies, according to venture capital research firm PitchBook. Other entities that he’s associated with, including an investment firm he founded with his brothers called Hydrazine Capital, have invested in two dozen more. This year alone, as OpenAI grew rapidly under his leadership, he made more than 20 investments. From 2011 to 2019, Altman was also an investor at Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s most prominent start-up incubator, where he served as lead partner on another 280 deals, giving him influence among dozens of the most promising start-ups in tech. Here are a few of the most notable investments in Altman’s empire. Nuclear fusion has been a science-fiction fantasy for decades. Unlike regular nuclear reactors, which generate power by splitting atoms, fusion reactors do the same by smashing two atoms together. A   from U.S. government scientists has ignited excitement that clean and cheap fusion energy may actually be possible. Despite those recent advances, many scientists and engineers are still skeptical that fusion will work any time soon. Several start-ups are trying to do it anyway, including Helion Energy. Altman invested in the Everett, Wash.-based company as a partner at Y Combinator in 2014. Then in 2021, he invested $375 million in the company, according to venture capital data firm CB Insights, his largest personal investment ever. In May, just months after investing billions of dollars in OpenAI, Microsoft signed a deal to be the first company to buy electricity from Helion, which it expects to begin producing in 2028. Remember the Concorde jet? Boom Aviation is one of a small group of companies trying to bring back supersonic commercial travel more than 20 years after the Concorde made its last flight. Altman first invested in Boom as a private investor in 2016. Then, as a partner at Y Combinator in 2019, Altman invested in the company again.

"Four of the NFL’s best teams were on the field Monday as part of the NFL’s Christmas triple-header. The Baltimore Ravens staked their claim to being the league’s top team by overwhelming the San Francisco 49ers. The Philadelphia Eagles escaped with a victory, at least. The Kansas City Chiefs continued to look nothing like themselves. Four of the NFL’s best teams were on the field Monday as part of the NFL’s Christmas triple-header. The Baltimore Ravens staked their claim to being the league’s top team by overwhelming the San Francisco 49ers. The Philadelphia Eagles escaped with a victory, at least. The Kansas City Chiefs continued to look nothing like themselves.  Their defense had four interceptions of passes by 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy. Their quarterback, Lamar Jackson, perhaps seized the lead in the league MVP competition. And the Ravens left no doubt which team is the leaguewide Super Bowl favorite as of Christmas. They outclassed the Niners, 33-19, in Santa Clara, Calif. If this indeed was a Super Bowl preview, it’s going to be a rather deflating Sunday in February in Las Vegas for the 49ers and their fans. This game was not all that competitive. Purdy was viewed by many observers as the NFL’s MVP front-runner entering the game. But the Ravens harassed him into two sacks and four interceptions, two of them by safety Kyle Hamilton. Ravens defenders tipped passes and hit Purdy’s arm in the pocket. Purdy left the field in the fourth quarter and was examined in the medical tent on the sideline after getting up slowly following a hit. He was replaced by backup quarterback Sam Darnold, who had a touchdown pass but also threw the 49ers’ fifth interception of the night. Bad news   Brock Purdy is headed to the medical tent.   Purdy left the medical tent and returned to the sideline, and the 49ers called him questionable to return to the game with a stinger. But Coach Kyle Shanahan kept Purdy on the sideline as Darnold finished the game. Trent Williams, the 49ers’ star left tackle, exited the game earlier with a groin injury. The Niners had their winning streak stopped at six games. They have been hailed as the NFL’s best team for much of this season. But they clearly were second-best Monday. They dropped to 11-4, although they retained the No. 1 seed in the NFC. They already have clinched the NFC West title. The Ravens improved to 12-3, now the NFL’s best mark. They’re a game ahead of the Miami Dolphins for the AFC’s top seed and have won five in a row. They host the Dolphins on Sunday in Baltimore. “We just started moving the ball in the right direction,"" Jackson told ABC after the game. ""And we just started having success.” Purdy is picked off by Kyle Hamilton! 📺:   on ABC 📱: Stream on      Jackson was the star of stars Monday. He threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns, while adding 45 rushing yards. “He’s putting on a show tonight,” Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman said on the ABC broadcast. It would be the second MVP for Jackson, who won the award in the 2019 season. “It’s cool,"" Jackson said. ""I’m honored to be in the conversation. I have one. Man, we’ve just got to keep winning, keep doing what we need to do to get to February. That’s all.” The Ravens scored on seven straight possessions at one point, with three touchdowns and four field goals. The Ravens led by 33-12 in the fourth quarter before the 49ers got a cosmetic touchdown with Darold at quarterback and threatened to add another. The one down note for the Ravens is that Hamilton exited the game in the late stages with a knee injury, the extent of which was not immediately clear. The statement that the Baltimore defense made with Monday’s performance, Jackson said, was nothing particularly new to him. “They’ve been making statements,"" Jackson said. ""I don’t think it’s anything new. That’s a great team that we just played. And they showed they can play against anybody—any atmosphere, anywhere. They just showed that tonight.”  They ended their losing streak at three games by holding on to beat the New York Giants, 33-25, in an NFC East clash in Philadelphia. But the defending NFC champions weren’t all that impressive, and they certainly weren’t dominant. The Eagles coasted to a 20-3 lead at halftime, and Giants Coach Brian Daboll benched undrafted rookie quarterback Tommy DeVito in favor of Tyrod Taylor. The Giants managed to make things rather interesting from there. They took advantage of a pair of Eagles turnovers — a fumble on a kickoff return after two Philadelphia players collided, then an interception by Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts that Adoree’ Jackson returned 76 yards for a touchdown — to pull within 20-18. What a start to the 2nd half for the Giants! 📺:   on FOX 📱: Stream on      Even when the Eagles steadied themselves to score the next 10 points, they could not put the game away. Taylor threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to Darius Slayton to get the Giants within 30-25 with five minutes remaining. The Eagles responded with a 43-yard field goal by Jake Elliott with 1:10 to play, then intercepted Taylor’s pass into the end zone as time expired. “I appreciate how we persevered,” Hurts told Fox. “Not the prettiest win, but we’ll take it. We haven’t won in a long time, so [it’s] definitely something to appreciate. We’ve got to keep building, man. We’ve got things we need to polish up and clean up as we make this push. But we need to finish strong. Everything is still in front of us.” ADOREE JACKSON PICK-SIX 🚨 📺:   on FOX 📱: Stream on      The Eagles won for the first time since Nov. 26 and improved to 11-4. They moved a game ahead of the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East. They also won six days after Hurts questioned whether the Eagles were “committed enough” following a defeat at Seattle. They won an 11th straight meeting with the Giants at Lincoln Financial Field. Even so, it was difficult to envision this victory being a springboard to bigger things for the Eagles. Yes, it was a division game, but it was quite a struggle against a Giants team that fell to 5-10 and was eliminated from playoff contention. It is only natural, after so many years of marveling at the greatness of the Chiefs, to expect them to work out all these issues, pull things together and begin resembling, well, the Kansas City Chiefs again at some point entering the playoffs. After all, Andy Reid is still dialing up the plays from the sideline. Patrick Mahomes is still slinging the passes from the pocket. And Travis Kelce is still finding seams in the defense to make catches. At some point, though, it begins to hit home that this is all there is, at least this season. It becomes clear that this is who the Chiefs are in 2023. It becomes time to accept that, even with an all-time great coach in Reid, a quarterback for the ages in Mahomes and a tight end as good as they come in Kelce, these Chiefs are simply not   Chiefs. Travis Kelce was not stoked  That was how it felt Monday. The Chiefs could not come up with enough answers to offset their own blunders and lost to the Las Vegas Raiders, 20-14, at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs handed the Raiders two defensive touchdowns seven seconds apart in the second quarter — on a fumble lost by Mahomes on a gadget play gone terribly wrong, followed by an interception by Mahomes — and did not have the offensive prowess to compensate. Kelce threw his helmet on the sideline in disgust at one point, leading to a brief conversation with Reid. The Chiefs look less and less like the team that has hosted the past five AFC championship games, reaching the Super Bowl three times and winning two titles during that prosperous run. It’s not that the Chiefs are inept. It’s not that the closest thing the NFL has had to a dynasty over the past half-decade has crumbled entirely and all at once. The Chiefs still have a respectable 9-6 record. They lead the AFC West by two games over the Raiders and Denver Broncos. They are the   in the AFC, behind only the Ravens and Dolphins. But they were eliminated Monday from contention for the No. 1 seed. And they are not playing like a viable Super Bowl contender — not even close. They have lost three of four and four of their past six games. Just when they should be figuring things out, everything looks out of sorts. Two TDs in seven seconds from the   defense! 📺:   on CBS/NICK 📱: Stream on      The wide receiver issues remain glaring. Mahomes and his wideouts too often are not on the same page. The gaffes are too frequent. The emotional outbursts provide glimpses of the mounting frustration. The Raiders were the beneficiaries Monday. They continued to bolster the case that Antonio Pierce,  , should receive the job on a more permanent basis. The Raiders improved to 4-3 under Pierce and 7-8 overall. “I think our team showed that we can go play on the road and do a hell of a job,” Pierce told CBS afterward. “Defense, offense — it was a team effort. Hell of a job by us. My [job situation] will take care of itself.” The Raiders were outgained by 103 yards, 308 to 205. Aidan O’Connell threw for only 62 yards on 9-for-21 passing. But tailback Zamir White ran for 145 yards. And defensive tackle Bilal Nichols and cornerback Jack Jones took advantage of the Chiefs’ generosity on offense. Nichols scored an eight-yard touchdown when Mahomes lost control of the ball on a trick-play handoff, and Jones followed with a 33-yard dash to the end zone after intercepting a Mahomes pass along the left sideline. That was all it took. The Chiefs were done — for the day and possibly for a season that is increasingly slipping way. This wasn’t a 70-point tour de force. It wasn’t about magnificent offensive artistry or breathtaking track-meet speed or next-level scheming. This was gritty, grimy football. It was all about blocking and tackling, about doing the little things right amid playoff-level intensity. It had little to do with those dazzling things the Miami Dolphins are known for. And it was exactly what the Dolphins needed. They got the signature win that they lacked, and they officially punched their ticket to the playoffs Sunday in Miami Gardens, Fla. The Dolphins crafted a workmanlike crunchtime drive that resulted in Jason Sanders’s fifth field goal of the day to beat the Dallas Cowboys, 22-20. “I think the key was the guys just having competitive greatness all over,” Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa told Fox afterward. “The defense did a great job. The offense did a great job. This was a great team win.” DOLPHINS CLINCH A PLAYOFF BERTH ON A WALK-OFF FIELD GOAL! 📺: FOX  The Dolphins improved to 11-4. They stayed two games ahead of the Buffalo Bills in the AFC East and remained on the heels of the Ravens for the top playoff seed in the AFC. Perhaps most importantly, the Dolphins demonstrated they could beat a good team. Their 10 previous victories this season had come against teams that began Sunday’s play at .500 or below. Their losses have come to the Bills, Chiefs and Eagles, with a come-from-ahead clunker against the Tennessee Titans thrown in the mix. The Cowboys’ championship mettle can be questioned; they followed a road loss to the Bills with this road loss to the Dolphins. But they are unquestionably a top-tier team at 10-5. They already had clinched a playoff berth. Dolphins Coach Mike McDaniel said during the week that he had given his players permission to dismiss such questions by media members about beating good teams. Now, McDaniel needn’t worry about such instructions. “I think if we were to listen to any of the narratives, I don’t think we’d be in the position that we’re in,” Tagovailoa said. “So I’m very proud of this team, very proud of the guys in that locker room continuing to fight for one another … and managing the outside noise. This is a game we’ll enjoy.” There were a few glimpses of the Dolphins’ usual flash, the sort of glitz and glamour that resulted in their 70-point showing against the Denver Broncos in September. Tagovailoa threw for 293 yards and a touchdown on 24-for-37 passing. An ankle injury slowed wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who still managed to contribute nine catches for 99 yards. Still, this game was more of a slog than a sprint. Sanders provided three field goals from longer than 50 yards. The Dolphins didn’t reach the end zone until the final seconds of the first half. They relied heavily on a defense that sacked Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott four times. It was a rugged game that featured a questionable roughing-the-passer call against each team in the first half, one on the Dolphins’ Christian Wilkins for supposedly landing on Prescott with all of his body weight and one on the Cowboys’ Micah Parsons for a hit to Tagovailoa’s back that seemed neither late nor to his head or neck. The Cowboys wasted a 15-play opening drive by losing a fumble on a first-down play from the Miami 1-yard line. The Dolphins failed on a fourth-and-goal attempt from the 5-yard line in the second quarter. The Dolphins led 13-7 at halftime following Tagovailoa’s four-yard touchdown pass to running back Raheem Mostert. They stretched their advantage to 19-10 in the third quarter. But the Cowboys used a 17-play touchdown drive to take the lead at 20-19 with 3:27 to play. Wideout Brandin Cooks made a terrific catch in the end zone of an eight-yard lob by Prescott. Tagovailoa and the Dolphins took it from there. “All the scenarios were going in my head,” Tagovailoa said. “And so we had to drive the ball down, make use of that clock and try to get it down to where we could give ourselves an opportunity to win the game.” It was a good Saturday for the Pittsburgh Steelers and especially for the Buffalo Bills as the NFL’s stretch run arrived, with so much still to be settled in the playoff picture. The Cincinnati Bengals weren’t nearly as fortunate.  They struggled more than expected Saturday night against the Los Angeles Chargers in Inglewood, Calif. But they got a 29-yard field goal from kicker Tyler Bass with 28 seconds remaining to escape with a 24-22 triumph that fortified their AFC playoff chances. The Bills won their third straight game to improve to 9-6. This victory did not have the cachet of their triumphs over the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys. The Chargers, after all, were coming off a 63-21 defeat to the Las Vegas Raiders that led to the firings of Brandon Staley as their coach and Tom Telesco as their general manager. But this still was significant for the Bills as they slid into the No. 6 playoff seed in the AFC. “When you’re playing a team with nothing to lose, that’s a dangerous team,” Bills quarterback Josh Allen said during his postgame news conference. “And that was a dangerous team we played today. We gutted it out and found a way.” Allen ran for two touchdowns and threw for another. But the Chargers, in their first game with Giff Smith as their interim head coach, hung tough even while playing without injured quarterback Justin Herbert. Fill-in starter Easton Stick avoided mistakes, and the Chargers had leads of 10-0 in the early going and 22-21 in the final minutes. Kicker Cameron Dicker produced five field goals. Bills take the lead with 28 seconds left on the Tyler Bass FG  on Peacock Also available on      But Allen and the Bills made the necessary plays in crunchtime. Allen had an 11-yard completion to wide receiver Stefon Diggs on a third-and-eight play on the winning field goal drive. He connected with wideout Khalil Shakir on a third-and-four play later on the drive, and Shakir got up off the turf to reach the end zone for an apparent 28-yard touchdown. It was reversed on an instant-replay review that showed Shakir was touched by a Chargers defender and thus was down by contact at the 13-yard line, leaving the Bills to eventually settle for Bass’s field goal. Stick and the Chargers had 28 seconds to try to move into position for another field goal, but failed. Ed Oliver had a key sack for the Bills on the first play of the Chargers’ final drive. The Bills continued to be unable to sustain any on-field excellence for extended stretches, a trend that has dogged them all season. But they got the victory they needed, with playoff-positioning help from the Bengals’ defeat. The Bills are a team that no one should want to face in the AFC playoffs, assuming they actually advance there. “That’s the name of the game right now,” Allen said. “This is our playoffs.”  They ended a three-game losing streak and pushed their record back above .500 by overwhelming the Bengals, 34-11, behind the exploits of wide receiver George Pickens and third-string quarterback Mason Rudolph on Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh. Coach Mike Tomlin had promised changes following the Steelers’ defeat in Indianapolis a week earlier. He followed through by benching Mitch Trubisky as the fill-in starter at quarterback, with starter Kenny Pickett still sidelined by a high ankle sprain. Rudolph came through by throwing touchdown passes of 86 and 66 yards to Pickens as part of a 17-for-27, 290-yard performance. The home crowd was left chanting Rudolph’s name. “I’ve only had a limited amount of reps with him in training camp,” Rudolph told NBC after the game. “The touchdown I threw to him in the preseason game, I think it just clicked, like, ‘This guy’s got a different gear and he makes a lot of great plays.’… We’ve got so many weapons, man, it was fun dispersing the ball to them today.” Pittsburgh is chanting ""MASON RUDOLPH!"" 💛🖤 📺:   on NBC 📱: Stream on      Pickens had been under intense scrutiny and heavy criticism for his lack of effort as a blocker on a play against the Colts. But he showed again what a gifted receiver he is. He had four catches for 195 yards. The Steelers won for the first time since a 16-10 triumph at Cincinnati on Nov. 26. Their season started to unravel with losses to the Arizona Cardinals, New England Patriots and Colts. There was increasing speculation about Tomlin’s future with the franchise as he faced the possibility of suffering his first losing season with the Steelers (8-7). But that is far less probable now, whether the Steelers can squeeze their way into the AFC playoff field or not. The loss put a major dent into the Bengals’ postseason hopes. They fell from sixth to 10th in the AFC standings. Their winning streak ended at three games. Jake Browning had thrived recently while filling in at quarterback for the injured Joe Burrow. But Browning failed to take advantage of the Steelers’ depleted secondary. He threw three interceptions and failed on a fourth-down incompletion into the end zone.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/23/nfl-week-16-preview-bengals-steelers-bills-chargers/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 00:43:00,
"Virginia Del. Elizabeth R. Guzman (D-Prince William) announced Thursday that she will be seeking the Democratic nomination to succeed Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who is running for governor instead. Guzman, 50, is a social worker and public administrator who emerged as a champion of immigrant rights, public education and organized labor following her election to the House of Delegates in 2017. She narrowly lost a state Senate primary in June after new redistricting maps grouped her with another well-known Democrat. Virginia Del. Elizabeth R. Guzman (D-Prince William) announced Thursday that she will be seeking the Democratic nomination to succeed Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who is running for governor instead. Guzman, 50, is a social worker and public administrator who emerged as a champion of immigrant rights, public education and organized labor following her election to the House of Delegates in 2017. She narrowly lost a state Senate primary in June after new redistricting maps grouped her with another well-known Democrat. Amid a growing field of candidates for Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, Guzman is casting herself as a coalition builder whose personal story — immigrating from Peru as a young single mother and then flipping a competitive, partially rural statehouse district — can win over voters in this blue-trending but competitive seat. “You have to fight for legislation that improves the lives of all of your constituents, and I think that’s where I’ve been one of the most effective legislators in Richmond,” she said in an interview this week. “I never had to compromise my values, but I was able to get things done.” Spanberger’s decision not to seek reelection has attracted several candidates seeking to represent the district, which includes Guzman’s home county of Prince William — a booming, diverse exurb of Washington — and stretches into rural, conservative parts of central Virginia. Three other Democrats, all of whom are also from Prince William, are running: County Supervisor   (Woodbridge), Del.   (Prince William) and  , a retired Army colonel who helped his brother file a report that brought about the first   into President  . At least four Republicans have also filed to run for the seat next fall, and the GOP’s national campaign arm for the House of Representatives has listed the seat as one of about three dozen Democratic-held “targets” it is looking to flip. The group released a statement Thursday calling Guzman a “dyed-in-the-wool progressive” who “makes the other Democrats in the race look like Democrats-in-name-only.” But in an   released Thursday, Guzman promised to “close the door on the Trump era for good” as she switched between English and Spanish and presented her own background as a case for championing the needs of marginalized groups. “I will keep fighting for people struggling,” she says in the ad, “because I know getting a little help along the way and achieving the American Dream goes hand in hand.” After coming to Virginia from Peru with her daughter in search of greater opportunity, Guzman worked three minimum-wage jobs at once before putting herself through college, getting married and starting a career as a social worker. She got involved in local politics as a way to push back on a hard-line immigration policy promoted by Republican leaders in Prince William. Amid a wave of Democratic wins in 2017, she unseated an eight-term GOP incumbent and became one of the first Latinas in the Virginia state legislature. Her election prompted then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to recruit Guzman to give the party’s   to Trump’s 2018 State of the Union address. Guzman emphasized in an interview that she has been able to collaborate with Republicans in the state House on bipartisan priorities such as boosting online child safety while promoting a host of liberal policies. After Democrats won control of the General Assembly in 2019, she pushed to guarantee   for home health-care workers, raise the age at which juveniles are tried as adults and   on public-sector collective bargaining. Her legislative efforts have at times attracted negative attention. In fall 2022, she ended up   over a bill that would have expanded the definition of child abuse to include inflicting “physical or mental injury” on children because of their gender identity or sexual orientation. (An erroneous news report — and then some Republicans and Democrats — falsely took the measure as threatening criminal charges against parents who deny their children gender-affirming medical treatments.) Guzman’s electoral success has been mixed since her first win several years ago. In 2021, she dropped out of the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor as she struggled to raise enough money to fund a competitive campaign. Earlier this year, she lost the primary for a state Senate seat by less than one percentage point. Newly drawn maps had looped her into the same House district with a veteran Black lawmaker, prompting her to unsuccessfully challenge state Sen. Jeremy McPike (D-Prince William) rather than competing against another state delegate of color. A potential matchup could have been in the works in the 7th Congressional District. McPike had also been expected to enter the race to succeed Spanberger but   Wednesday that he would instead focus on his duties in the General Assembly. Guzman, who helped with Spanberger’s Hispanic outreach efforts against a Latina GOP opponent last year, says she knows the turf well. And while some other primary candidates will remain in local or state office next spring and must juggle their campaigns with legislating, Guzman’s loss earlier this year means she will have more time to devote herself to the 7th Congressional District, she said. Her own story, she says, shows that “an immigrant with an accent could win elections. That’s a strength and not a weakness.” A previous version of this article incorrectly said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was House speaker in 2018. Pelosi was minority leader then. The article has been corrected.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/30/virginia-7th-congressional-district-elizabeth-guzman/,Washington Post,2023-11-30 14:44:00,

"One of the most vital figures in D.C. sports typically arrives at Capital One Arena in the dead of night, leaves the building before the majority of the city’s residents have started their day and is asleep during the games and concerts he works dutifully to ensure take place. Kim Webster, the senior director of Capital One Arena operations for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, oversees the changeovers at the downtown venue, which hosts more than 200 events every year. Working behind the scenes and against the clock, Webster and his crew transform the floor from a basketball court to a hockey rink one night and from a hockey rink to an elaborate concert stage or Monster Truck Jam course the next, over and over and over again. Without their efforts, the arena’s ever-changing show couldn’t go on. One of the most vital figures in D.C. sports typically arrives at Capital One Arena in the dead of night, leaves the building before the majority of the city’s residents have started their day and is asleep during the games and concerts he works dutifully to ensure take place. Kim Webster, the senior director of Capital One Arena operations for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, oversees the changeovers at the downtown venue, which hosts more than 200 events every year. Working behind the scenes and against the clock, Webster and his crew transform the floor from a basketball court to a hockey rink one night and from a hockey rink to an elaborate concert stage or Monster Truck Jam course the next, over and over and over again. Without their efforts, the arena’s ever-changing show couldn’t go on. “For me, there’s no Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,” Webster said in a recent phone interview. “It’s more like Wizards, Caps, Wizards, Caps, Georgetown. I go by what we’re doing, and I couldn’t tell you what day it is now.” Webster  tell you how long he has been in the arena management business. This season marks 50 years for the 71-year-old, dating from his first job as a member of the crew that opened Capital Centre in 1973. Webster was a 21-year-old living with his mother in Seat Pleasant when Washington Bullets owner Abe Pollin broke ground on his new arena in nearby Landover in August 1972. On the advice of his stepfather, a WTOP cameraman, Webster applied for and landed a part-time job cleaning the arena as it was built. “I can remember sleeping up in the seats for a couple hours and coming back down and working again,” Webster said of the round-the-clock shifts required in the final weeks leading up to Capital Centre’s first game. “It was pretty hectic.” The gig paid $4.50 an hour, but it provided access to all the concerts, Bullets games and, beginning in 1974, Capitals games at the arena Webster could stomach. About five years later, he became a full-time member of Capital Centre’s changeover crew, working under the direction of longtime arena supervisor John Edwin “Chief” Gentry, whose  . Gentry retired in 1988. Webster became the changeover boss after Pollin moved the Capitals and Wizards to their current downtown arena, which was originally named MCI Center, in December 1997. “[Webster is] the conductor of the Capital One Arena orchestra,” said Jordan Silberman, the president of venues for Monumental Sports & Entertainment. “We wouldn’t be able to pull off all the events we do without him in his role, and we are indebted to his 50 years of service.” Most changeovers begin after midnight and take about seven hours to complete. The average time of a changeover will be trimmed considerably from the start of the basketball and hockey seasons to the end, Silberman said, as the roughly 20 seasonal and part-time workers who assist Webster’s more experienced full-time crew of 18 get more comfortable with the process throughout the seasons. The thousands of changeovers Webster has been a part of over the past 50 years tend to run together, but there are some exceptions, including the time Capital Centre was hosting a rodeo and a few cattle escaped their corral. “When we got down there, the security guard was standing on top of his desk,” Webster said with a laugh. About five times per season, Capital One Arena hosts two events in different sports on the same day, which requires an all-hands-on-deck approach to complete the changeover on a more compressed timeline. Such was the case earlier this month, when the Georgetown men’s basketball team hosted Syracuse for an 11:30 a.m. tip-off and the Capitals welcomed the New York Rangers for a game that night. Shortly after the buzzer sounded on the  , Webster and his crew got to work removing the chairs and bleachers on the floor level. Then they attacked the 120-foot-by-60-foot court, which is composed of 238 panels, applying cardboard to protect the surface of each piece before loading them onto pallets and taking them to a storage room beneath the lower bowl of the arena on forklifts. Most of the arena’s hockey dasherboards remain in place for basketball games, except for the corner sections, which are removed and stored for egress and ingress. Webster’s crew reinstalled the corners as two separate groups began building the penalty box and players’ benches. Then they installed the glass on top of the dasherboards before adjusting and tightening each panel as necessary and loading the subfloor that sits atop the ice onto pallets for storage. Webster pitched in on various tasks, but he was mostly there to make sure the detailed plan he developed for his crew went smoothly and everything got done on time. “Being 71, I try not to do too much physical labor, but it’s quite a job trying to keep 35 guys and personalities on point and dedicated to what we’re trying to do,” he said. “He’s still getting his hands dirty,” Silberman said. “He’s on his hands and knees troubleshooting issues. There aren’t many people like Kim. He is a different breed.” The quick changeover was completed without a hitch, but there was little time to celebrate. Soon after the Capitals  , Webster’s crew began preparing the arena to host a concert the next night. During the overlapping basketball and hockey seasons, Webster, with the aid of blackout curtains, adjusts his sleep schedule to accommodate his odd hours. He wakes up around 10 p.m., has breakfast and makes the half-hour drive from his home in Crofton to the arena. Webster has managed to find joy in a job many fans who attend events at Capital One Arena may not realize exists, and he takes pride in the fact that his crew has met every deadline through the years. “I love what I do,” he said. “You’re doing something that’s making thousands of people happy, and it’s a great feeling of accomplishment.” “He is an exemplar — working hard, behind the scenes late at night and early in the morning,” Monumental Sports & Entertainment founder Ted Leonsis said in a statement. “He is a true hero among our Monumental family and I congratulate him on this milestone. His relentless work ethic is inspiring and because of what he does, we can leave an indelible mark on fans night after night.” Given his sleep schedule, Webster rarely watches Capitals or Wizards games, but he wears a Stanley Cup ring after getting swept up in the excitement of the Capitals’ title run in 2018. “Everybody on the crew felt it,” he said. “It was electric.” Webster would like to retire in the near future, so expect someone else to be in charge of the changeovers if the Capitals and Wizards move to a   in 2028. “Fifty years doing this is great. I love the job, but I’d also like to spend time with my family,” Webster said. “I miss holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, parties. I’m dedicated to what I do, but I would like to spend a little time with my wife, go camping, kayaking — stuff I like to do.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/23/capital-one-arena-kim-webster-changeovers/,Washington Post,2023-12-23 10:00:00,
"ELMONT, N.Y. — The jerseys that the Washington Capitals wear for practice often tell a story.

ELMONT, N.Y. — The jerseys that the Washington Capitals wear for practice often tell a story. The forwards are typically split in two, with half the group wearing red and half the group wearing white. When the players take the ice, before any drills get underway, the color a player is wearing can be the first hint that line changes are afoot; the three players on each line all normally wear the same color. On Thursday at UBS Arena, as the Capitals trickled out for practice, it quickly became evident Washington Coach Spencer Carbery had tweaked things  . Less than 24 hours after   by the New York Rangers — a loss that brought back Carbery’s season-long frustration with the Capitals’ lack of five-on-five scoring — center Connor McMichael was wearing white for Thursday’s practice, while his usual linemates, Anthony Mantha and Aliaksei Protas, donned red. The   has been a consistent contributor for Washington over the past month, and Carbery hasn’t wanted to disrupt its reliable chemistry. But in the wake of Wednesday’s loss, McMichael moved up to center Alex Ovechkin and Tom Wilson, while Dylan Strome took McMichael’s vacated spot with Protas and Mantha. “That’s something that I think we’ll start with [in Friday’s game] and see where it goes from there,” Carbery said. “Just trying to get a different look. We’ve been hesitant to do something like that because of taking away from the success of Mikes, Pro and Mo. But we feel like we may need to alter some things to try to help in some different areas.” Carbery’s assessment of what McMichael will bring to his new top-line role was succinct: “Confidence. Speed. Playmaking ability.” The last time Strome’s line with Ovechkin and Wilson produced an even-strength goal was Dec. 10, seven games ago. Even more striking:  , that line has been on the ice for eight five-on-five goals all season — only one more than the fourth line of Nic Dowd, Nicolas Aube-Kubel and Beck Malenstyn. Now, as the Capitals again seek a spark among their forwards, the 22-year-old McMichael will take a turn in the top spot on the lineup card Friday when Washington faces the New York Islanders. “Just [looking for them to] control play,” Carbery said. “Being able to generate a little bit of chemistry, some [offensive]-zone shifts. Being able to read off one another, support one another. Be able to generate, whether it’s off the rush, whether it’s off forecheck pressure where we’re able to attack or [offensive]-zone sequences. Being able to have some sequences like that.” A week after defenseman Ethan Bear   to continue his rehab from shoulder surgery, with the expectation that a contract would be made official in the near future, Bear is now officially a Capital, having signed a two-year, $4.125 million contract that has a salary cap hit of $2.0625 million. Because Bear signed partway through the season, the first year of the contract is prorated, and Bear will be paid $1.375 million. He then will be paid $2.75 million next season. Thursday’s session was the first full practice for the Capitals since Bear arrived; he has taken part in morning skates and optional practices, but because of the schedule, the full team had not been together for a regular practice in over a week. Bear skated on the right side of the second defensive pair, alongside  . Trevor van Riemsdyk, who has played with Sandin for much of this season, appeared to be the player who would come out of the lineup when Bear goes in. Van Riemsdyk skated with Alex Alexeyev, who has been a healthy scratch for 14 consecutive games, while the first and third pairs — Martin Fehervary and John Carlson, and Joel Edmundson and Nick Jensen — remained unchanged. Carbery didn’t fully commit to Bear making his season debut Friday, and Bear still needs clearance from doctors before he can play. But after a six-month recovery process, he’s anxiously awaiting his chance. “Everything feels good,” Bear said. “I’m healthy. I’m ready to roll. It’s any day now when I’m going to play, so we’ll just take it day by day. I feel good. I’m excited. Just ready for when I get that nod.” Six months is a long time to be away from the game, but Bear said it went quickly, and his itch to play has only grown since he arrived in Washington last week. “Now that it’s all settling in here, I’ve done everything I possibly could to be ready,” Bear said. “I’m not going to be second-guessing myself. I’m ready to play when I get that chance.” For several weeks, Carbery has been saying forward Max Pacioretty is “real close” to playing. On Thursday, Pacioretty skated on a regular line during practice for the first time, joining Evgeny Kuznetsov and Matthew Phillips. As he did with Bear, Carbery didn’t commit to Pacioretty playing Friday, but the forward is expected to play before the week is over. “I would expect him to play one of the next two games, barring anything minor setback-wise,” Carbery said. “Got him into, not necessarily that he’ll play tomorrow, but just to get him into a line, some more reps. Get him even more comfortable so that if he does in fact go tomorrow, try to get him into those situations as much as possible.” Pacioretty hasn’t played in nearly a year after suffering his   in the span of five months last January. Carbery attempted to temper expectations, given Pacioretty’s lengthy absence and the time it will take to shake off the rust, but there’s no denying that the Capitals are eagerly anticipating adding a proven goal scorer to their lineup. “We’re looking for scoring any way we can find it five-on-five,” Carbery said. “He has proven in the past that he’s been able to contribute in that department. He will be a welcomed addition.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/28/connor-mcmichael-caps-top-line/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 17:16:00,
"Cornerback Dorian Strong is among the many players on Virginia Tech’s roster from the Washington region who have been back in the area for nearly a week preparing for Wednesday afternoon’s Military Bowl. The redshirt junior, however, has a bit more relevant history than most of his teammates who grew up in D.C. or the surrounding suburbs. Cornerback Dorian Strong is among the many players on Virginia Tech’s roster from the Washington region who have been back in the area for nearly a week preparing for Wednesday afternoon’s Military Bowl. The redshirt junior, however, has a bit more relevant history than most of his teammates who grew up in D.C. or the surrounding suburbs. In the 2019 Maryland 4A championship — the final game of Strong’s high school career at Wise —  the Upper Marlboro native caught a 42-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter to give the Pumas the lead over Northwest. That game, a 35-14 Wise win, was at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium, where the Hokies (6-6) are set to face Tulane (11-2). When Virginia Tech learned its bowl destination this month, Strong could not help but recall the last time he played in Annapolis while also eagerly anticipating the chance to help the Hokies finish with their first winning record since 2019. “It’s exciting because I’ve definitely seen a couple of my [high school] coaches and my family,” Strong said last week, not long after announcing he would return to Virginia Tech for his final season of eligibility. “It’s going to be fun to have them in the stands, knowing I’m out there playing, knowing I’m out there balling, knowing they haven’t seen me play in a couple of years, so I’ve got to put on a show.” Strong has started every game for the Hokies this season, collecting three interceptions and eight pass breakups with 21 tackles. He was selected third-team all-ACC and helped Virginia Tech finish fourth in the conference in total defense (322.2 yards per game) and third in passing defense (172.9). With several regulars on defense — including Silver Spring native Mansoor Delane (Archbishop Spalding), the other starting cornerback — from the Washington area, the Hokies are making their third appearance in the Military Bowl. They  , 35-31, in the 2018 edition and  , 33-17, in 2014. “I’m glad to be able to come back home and play in front of the DMV,” said freshman cornerback Dante Lovett, whose last game in high school at DeMatha   in last year’s WCAC title game at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. “It’s a great opportunity. It’s real fun to be back out here.” The resurgent Hokies closed the season with two wins in their last three games, securing bowl eligibility  , 55-17, at Scott Stadium on Nov. 25 to also claim the Commonwealth Cup in the regular season finale. Virginia Tech turned around its season after losing three in a row in September amid quarterback uncertainty. Coach Brent Pry eventually chose to stick with redshirt sophomore Kyron Drones, a transfer from Baylor, as the starter over Grant Wells, who had won the job in preseason camp. Wells recently announced he would enter the transfer portal. “Living like 35, 40 minutes from here, it’s pretty special,” said Hokies defensive tackle Josh Fuga, a redshirt senior from Woodbridge who played high school football at Freedom. “I have a lot of people, a lot of friends, coming who always said they wanted to come to a game but things got messed up. Now they have no excuse.” Virginia Tech has been staying at a hotel in D.C. and practicing at the St. James in Springfield, where local high school coaches have been observing workouts at the invitation of Pry. In his second year with the Hokies, the former Penn State defensive coordinator has made recruiting in the D.C. area, particularly Northern Virginia, a priority. The Hokies have 19 players on their roster with local ties, including nine freshmen. Next season’s freshman class features three prospects who played at area high schools, headlined by defensive back Joshua Clarke (Flint Hill), the 14th-ranked recruit in Virginia, according to 247 Sports. Defensive lineman Emmett Laws of DeMatha and linebacker Gabe Williams of Pallotti also have signed with the Hokies. “That’s the two-way street we talk about,” Pry said after a recent practice. “A lot of guys want to be protective and not let anybody see it and not let anybody watch. It’s a two-way street. We’re going to recruit your schools and want [coaches] to help keep their players at home and in-state. We want to be there for them, and this is a great opportunity for them to come and see us in bowl prep.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/26/virginia-tech-tulane-military-bowl-preview/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 13:54:00,
"NEW YORK — Mark Davis stepped away from the party for a moment as Wednesday night turned to Thursday morning. The pause didn’t last long before Chelsea Gray’s mother arrived to drag him back to the festivities. Moments earlier, Coach Becky Hammon was doing the Tootsie Roll dance, and Kelsey Plum skipped back and forth with a barrel speaker on her shoulder, with gold bottles of Armand De Brignac champagne all around. NEW YORK — Mark Davis stepped away from the party for a moment as Wednesday night turned to Thursday morning. The pause didn’t last long before Chelsea Gray’s mother arrived to drag him back to the festivities. Moments earlier, Coach Becky Hammon was doing the Tootsie Roll dance, and Kelsey Plum skipped back and forth with a barrel speaker on her shoulder, with gold bottles of Armand De Brignac champagne all around. The Las Vegas Aces   to win back-to-back championships with a 70-69 victory over the New York Liberty in Game 4 of the Finals, the first repeat champions since the Los Angeles Sparks in 2001-02, and the celebration was in full swing. Adding insult to injury for their opponents, all of this took place on the Liberty’s home practice court inside a Barclays Center that was rocking for two games before fans exited with disappointment etched on their faces. Davis bought the team before the 2021 season as it was coming off a Finals appearance in the coronavirus-affected bubble season the year before. At that point, the organization was just three years removed from three consecutive single-digit-victory seasons as the San Antonio Stars. Now it has won two titles and reached the Finals in three of four seasons. “I’ve been around sports all my life. I know how hard it is to win a championship,” said Davis, who also owns the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders. “And then to repeat is even harder. What I did is I hired three strong women. And I got the hell out of the way.” The three women were President Nikki Fargas, General Manager Natalie Williams and Hammon. They have led the organization to a place among some of the most prolific teams in league history, with plenty of room to continue. The Aces, Sparks and 1997-2000 Houston Comets are the only back-to-back champions in the WNBA’s 27-year existence. A’ja Wilson became the third player in league history to be the No. 1 draft pick and be named defensive player of the year, MVP and Finals MVP, joining Candace Parker and Lauren Jackson with the distinction. Wilson also became the first player in Finals history with multiple 20-point, 15-rebound games. The statistical accomplishments go on and on. “It’s historical, right?” forward Alysha Clark said with a smile. With Wilson as the franchise cornerstone, the Aces will also bring back former No. 1 picks Plum and Jackie Young, who are both two-time all-stars; 2022 Finals MVP Gray, a five-time all-star; and sixth player of the year Clark. And they still may find a way to bring back Parker, who signed before the season and played just 18 games before suffering a fractured foot. They will enter the 2024 season as the favorite to win again, with a chance to join the Comets as the only teams to win at least three titles in a row. Wilson, Plum and Young are all under 30 years old and still have room to grow. “This was created by a lot of really good people being excellent at their jobs every day,” Hammon said. “And we appreciate all the work that goes unseen and unsaid. And we are truly a team.” The year wasn’t all smooth for the Aces.   in May after former player Dearica Hamby accused the coach and team of  .

"D.C. United selected   with the seventh pick of the  Tuesday, but the sophomore forward said he has not decided whether to turn pro right away or remain in school for at least another season. “I’m just really excited with the opportunity right now,” said Murrell, a Maryland native who had 11 goals and four assists in 19 matches this fall. “Some stuff has to shake out in the next few weeks. ... I’m thrilled to be picked by D.C., just to be able to stay home and stay in this area.” D.C. United selected   with the seventh pick of the  Tuesday, but the sophomore forward said he has not decided whether to turn pro right away or remain in school for at least another season. “I’m just really excited with the opportunity right now,” said Murrell, a Maryland native who had 11 goals and four assists in 19 matches this fall. “Some stuff has to shake out in the next few weeks. ... I’m thrilled to be picked by D.C., just to be able to stay home and stay in this area.” If Murrell does not sign, United would retain his MLS rights until Dec. 31, 2025. Hoyas Coach Brian Wiese said Murrell is “leaning heavily toward coming back,” but that could change as contract talks accelerate. The 6-foot-3 Murrell is from Forest Hill, north of Baltimore, and played for McDonogh School and Pipeline Soccer Club, which was co-founded by former United forward Santino Quaranta. Murrell was the Gatorade national high school player of the year in 2022. He had seven goals and four assists in 21 games as a Georgetown freshman, then spent last summer in the National Premier Soccer League with the Annapolis Blues, a fourth-division amateur team. This fall, his stock soared after he scored eight goals in the Hoyas’ first nine matches. “He is improving at a rate that is pretty frightening,” Wiese said, adding that, should Murrell return to Georgetown, he would be a candidate for the Hermann Trophy, which is awarded to college soccer’s best player. “When he is running, he is dangerous,” Wiese said. “He still needs to build his game in the box and improve in the air, but he works so hard to get better.” Wiese said Murrell has the potential to become a player like Duncan McGuire, the Orlando City rookie out of Creighton who had 13 goals this season. With its first selection of the second round, United selected Clemson captain  , a senior midfielder who scored in the Tigers’ NCAA championship game victory over Notre Dame last week. Later in the round, United claimed the MLS rights to former North Carolina defender  , who is under contract with second-division Sacramento Republic. In the third round, D.C. chose Wisconsin junior goalkeeper  . With the draft’s No. 1 pick, Toronto FC claimed Lipscomb forward  , a Trinidad and Tobago native who recorded 29 goals and 18 assists in a 57-game NCAA career. Duke sophomore defender-midfielder   (St. Albans School and Bethesda Soccer Club) was chosen second by the Colorado Rapids. His father, also named Wayne, is the former Howard University president. Two picks later, Colorado selected Maryland freshman forward  , the Big Ten freshman of the year who had three goals and seven assists in 14 matches. The draft came at a busy time for United.  , is conducting the coaching search after the club   in October. No decision is imminent, two people familiar with the matter said. The draft is among several platforms that Mackay will use to enhance the roster. Free agency is underway, and the international marketplace is open. Mackay also is weighing whether to retain playmaker Gabriel Pirani, whose loan from Brazilian club Santos expires Dec. 31, and is overseeing the pursuit of a third designated player to join striker Christian Benteke and midfielder Mateusz Klich on high-end contracts. This month, United   from St. Louis City for defensive midfielder Chris Durkin,   from Montreal for Ruan. United has made several front-office changes. Aside from Mackay’s appointment, Caleb Shreve, who worked with Mackay in Nashville before joining Orlando, was named assistant general manager, and Clarens Cheridieu was picked as director of player personnel after serving as assistant GM of second-division Loudoun United. Technical director Stewart Mairs and director of scouting Sean Howe  , and longtime executive Dave Kasper moved into a consulting role. MLS will unveil its 2024 schedule Wednesday.

"Civil rights groups and residents in Wicomico County filed a federal voting rights lawsuit Thursday against the county on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, alleging that its system for electing school board and council members is racially discriminatory and unlawful. The Wicomico County NAACP, the Caucus of African American Leaders and the Watchmen With One Voice Ministerial Alliance joined four Wicomico residents in charging the county with violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which the plaintiffs say extends from “a long and disgraceful history of discrimination against Black residents.” Civil rights groups and residents in Wicomico County filed a federal voting rights lawsuit Thursday against the county on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, alleging that its system for electing school board and council members is racially discriminatory and unlawful. The Wicomico County NAACP, the Caucus of African American Leaders and the Watchmen With One Voice Ministerial Alliance joined four Wicomico residents in charging the county with violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which the plaintiffs say extends from “a long and disgraceful history of discrimination against Black residents.” The system in place, plaintiffs argue in court filings, empowers “Wicomico’s white majority to override and dilute the influence of Black voters, suppress Black candidacies, and deny Black residents equal opportunity to elect their chosen representatives.” The seven-member boards are composed of five district-based positions and two at-large positions, which, according to the complaint consistently delivers a racial makeup of six White representatives and one Black representative on each body. Black people account for about 30 percent of the county’s roughly 104,000 residents, and people of color overall comprise about 40 percent, census data shows. “The at-large component of the election systems for the Wicomico County Council and the Board of Education, together with the polarization of voting in the county, essentially reserves the at-large seats for whites only,” Eddie Boyd, a county resident and one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “This is not speculation, as no African American has been elected at-large since the creation of the system. We need a new system that is equitable to all the parties involved.” Wicomico County attorney Paul Wilbur said Friday that the county and officials named as defendants, including Board of Elections President Katrina Purnell and Board of Education Chairman Eugene Malone, have not yet been served with the lawsuit. Filed in federal court in Baltimore, the lawsuit says Wicomico’s current voting system is in violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits any voting law or practice that results in a “denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.” The county’s only majority-Black district accounts for the lone Black representation on both the council and the school board. About 60 percent of Wicomico public school children are students of color, the suit notes. It calls for the at-large seats to be eliminated and the boards to be represented by seven districts, including two with a majority Black population. It also asks the court to issue an injunction barring the county from holding elections under the current system. “This lawsuit has been decades in the making, but now, both the County Council and School Board must reform their discriminatory election systems to comply with the Voting Rights Act and to afford Black voters equal opportunities to elect their candidates of choice,” Deborah Jeon, legal director for the ACLU of Maryland and one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “They can do so voluntarily, or await a court order. But we are determined, at long last, to see fair representation for Wicomico’s Black residents and families.” The 35-page lawsuit includes a detailed history of racial mistreatment in Wicomico County over the past 120 years, including segregation, lynchings, educational and economic discrimination, the removal of established Black neighborhoods for highway construction projects and voter intimidation and obstruction. “This is not a new struggle, but a new front on an old one that has been going on since the reconstruction era,” Monica Brooks, president of the Wicomico County branch of the NAACP, said in a statement. “There has rarely been a time in our country’s history where there hasn’t been some form of racist disenfranchisement or gerrymandering, and Wicomico is no exception … unless we can use this moment to prove otherwise … unless we can create a ‘new reconstruction’.” Carl Snowden, a longtime Maryland civil rights activist whose Caucus of African American Leaders is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, was involved in efforts in the 1980s that brought voting rights lawsuits to communities on the Eastern Shore, Annapolis and Prince George’s County. Back then, Snowden said in an interview Friday, there was not a single African American member of the General Assembly from the Eastern Shore despite its significant Black population. There are recent examples of court-ordered changes to voting laws leading to the elections of Black representatives in Maryland. In November, voters elected the  in Federalsburg, a small town in nearby Caroline County. “One of the great benefits of the Voting Rights Act is that it empowers powerless people so we have today African American mayors and board members and representatives in various jurisdictions on the Eastern Shore,” Snowden said. He expects the lawsuit filed Thursday to bring changes to Wicomico County. “This lawsuit really attempts to, through the courts, reverse historic wrongs,” Snowden said. “With the stroke of a pen, judges have been able to make it possible for people of color to elect representatives of their choice.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/08/maryland-wicomico-lawsuit-naacp-civil-rights/,Washington Post,2023-12-08 17:19:00,
"Jordan Poole needed a moment to cool off. When the Washington Wizards guard was subbed out in the middle of the second quarter Tuesday night, he walked past his teammates’ outstretched hands and beyond the trainer trying to hand him a warmup jacket as he beelined to an empty spot near an exercise bike just off the court. He had just made a bad pass that resulted in a turnover, and the spot where he stood with his hands on his hips, staring at the action on the court, offered some solace — no one but teammate Delon Wright keeping his legs warm and a few security guards stood by. Jordan Poole needed a moment to cool off. When the Washington Wizards guard was subbed out in the middle of the second quarter Tuesday night, he walked past his teammates’ outstretched hands and beyond the trainer trying to hand him a warmup jacket as he beelined to an empty spot near an exercise bike just off the court. He had just made a bad pass that resulted in a turnover, and the spot where he stood with his hands on his hips, staring at the action on the court, offered some solace — no one but teammate Delon Wright keeping his legs warm and a few security guards stood by. What an argument for taking a break during the workday. Although Poole’s Wizards fell for the third time this season to the ascendant Orlando Magic, this time by a 127-119 score, his 18-point charge in the fourth quarter helped them make it a tight game late. It isn’t often a crowd erupts for a team that’s trailing by 14 points in the final quarter, but that’s what happened when Poole danced, then leaped over the three-point line to nail a shot with 5:06 to play. The folks at Capital One Arena were on to something — the Wizards (5-24) went on a 12-2 run after that to get within four with just over two minutes to play. But without staunch defense, they couldn’t close. “He’s had stretches where there’s been frustration, whether it’s been lack of calls, missed shots,” said Wizards Coach Wes Unseld Jr., who credited his team’s defense for allowing Poole’s offense to flow. “… He was able to channel that frustration into something positive.” Poole tied a season high with 30 points, including six three-pointers. His efforts combined with strong play from Daniel Gafford and Tyus Jones to make the night a good fight, at least, for the second consecutive meeting with Orlando (18-11). Jones had 22 points and six assists. Gafford had 13 points, 13 rebounds, three assists, three blocks and two steals. And as solid as they were, the fourth-quarter spurt was thanks to more than just the three leaders. Rookie Bilal Coulibaly had a critical assist and drew fouls, and Kyle Kuzma was in the right place at the right time for a crucial block. “Just trying to be aggressive down the stretch,” Poole said to explain his success late. “We needed to make one last push. ... The crowd got involved a little bit, so that gave us some energy, but we needed to make a push.” By then, though, the Wizards had flubbed too often on offense — they had 20 turnovers — and allowed the Magic to get comfortable on defense. After an eight-point first half, Paolo Banchero poured in 12 points in the third quarter, and Franz Wagner matched him. Wagner ended up leading Orlando with 28 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, and Banchero was close on his heels with 24 points and eight assists. Rookie Anthony Black had a career-high 23 points. Here’s what else to know about the Wizards’ loss: With Banchero and Wagner working, the Wizards lost the most ground — 70 points — in the paint despite Gafford’s strong play. Orlando shot 52.7 percent overall. Wright was back from a left knee sprain for his first game since Nov. 10. He had seven points, four rebounds and a steal in 13 minutes off the bench. “He worked hard to be back. It was definitely a spark for us — good to have him back,” Jones said of the defensive-minded guard. “He was classic Delon tonight: couple steals, couple deflections, just disrupting things on defense, was able to get to the paint a couple times, get a couple nice buckets.” Can a run of three baskets in a row really be that special? As it turns out, yes. Gafford went on a mighty, if mini, tear just before halftime to keep Orlando from gaining steam heading into the break. He had an athletic block and two difficult offensive rebounds in the final 2:20 of the second quarter — and scored after each play to keep things competitive.

Tuesday will go down as a momentous date in American political history, with the Colorado Supreme Court ruling that a former president engaged in insurrection and is therefore . The  , the first of its kind involving  , would keep him off the 2024 primary ballot in the state over his role in the  , 2021, insurrection. A state district court previously ruled that Trump had engaged in insurrection but that the relevant section of the 14th Amendment did not apply to presidents. The state Supreme Court upheld the former finding and reversed the latter, in a 4-3 decision. It delayed its ruling until at least Jan. 4, just before the deadline for the Colorado secretary of state to certify the primary ballot, to allow the U.S. Supreme Court to review the issue if it chooses to. Trump’s campaign quickly signaled that it would appeal. Below are some takeaways. The decision is at once explosive and likely to have little direct impact on the 2024 election. Colorado has trended blue in recent decades and is not considered a competitive state in presidential elections, having given   a 13.5-point victory in 2020. That made it the 14th-bluest state — the kind of state that if Trump ever won it, he would most likely secure more than enough electoral votes to be elected. Nor is Colorado’s primary particularly important. Its contest is slated for March 5, Super Tuesday, alongside a dozen other states. Trump is a huge favorite for the GOP nomination and very likely won’t need Colorado. It also bears noting that the victory for those seeking to disqualify Trump could prove fleeting. The U.S. Supreme Court may reverse the ruling. But the Colorado ruling also states that Trump is to remain on the ballot after Jan. 4 if someone merely seeks review at the U.S. Supreme Court, until the Supreme Court issues an order. If a decision isn’t prompt enough to change the ballot, Trump could stay on it by default. That doesn’t mean the decision is unremarkable. For one thing, it’s historic. For another, it’s conceivable that Colorado becoming the first state to disqualify Trump could embolden other judges and states to go down a similar road, in a way that counts. What’s more, the ruling could allow Trump to rally supporters behind a sense of persecution that has already proven potent in the GOP primaries. Even some Trump critics were quick to criticize the decision. “I do not believe Donald Trump should be prevented from being president of the United States by any court,” said former New Jersey governor   (R), one of Trump’s primary opponents, who has attacked him over Jan. 6. “I think he should be prevented from being president of the United States by the voters of this country. ... And I don’t believe it’s good for our country if he’s precluded from the ballot by a court.” A   last year found that 7 in 10 Republicans said it was not even appropriate to label Jan. 6 an “insurrection,” which gives you a flavor of how this might play on the right. Whether the decision could be replicated remains to be seen. All seven justices on the Colorado Supreme Court were appointed by Democratic governors. That means three Democratic appointees disagreed with the court’s decision. Republicans were also much quicker to attack the decision than Democrats were to hail it, suggesting there is unease on the left with this method of defeating Trump. Section 3 of the   bars from “any office, civil or military, under the United States,” anyone who takes an oath “as an officer of the United States ... to support the Constitution of the United States [who] shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.” Denver District Judge Sarah B. Wallace previously cited the timeline of Trump’s actions and his history of promoting political violence in finding that Trump “  and direct it at the Capitol with the purpose of disrupting the electoral certification.” But she also ruled that Section 3 wasn’t meant to pertain to presidents. The state Supreme Court stated that she erred on that latter count. It took issue with Wallace’s rationale that earlier drafts of the 14th Amendment explicitly mentioned the presidency and the idea that it was specifically excluded. The court cited a drafter of the amendment, then-Rep. Samuel McKee (Ky.), who at one point described the aim as barring traitors “from all political power in the nation.” “While nothing in Representative McKee’s speeches mentions why his express reference to the Presidency was removed,” the court ruled, “his public pronouncements leave no doubt that his subsequent draft proposal still sought to ensure that rebels had absolutely no access to political power.” The decision sets up the U.S. Supreme Court to make yet another major ruling relating to Trump and Jan. 6 — potentially a third to crowd the docket in the coming weeks and months. Already in the last week or so, special counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to   from his election-subversion indictment. Then the Supreme Court signaled it would   against hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, including Trump: obstruction of an official proceeding. Some judges have rejected or expressed skepticism about that charge’s applicability. The Supreme Court hasn’t signaled whether it will review the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision, but regardless, its handling of the matter will constitute a major decision. If the court somehow declines to review the case, it will effectively allow Trump to be excluded from the ballot. If it takes up the case, the decision about his eligibility would be up to a conservative-leaning court containing three members nominated by Trump himself. Such a decision could also prove significant for many other efforts to disqualify Trump, which thus far haven’t been successful. Perhaps anticipating the U.S. Supreme Court’s review, the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision cited a 2012 opinion by then-appeals court Judge Neil M. Gorsuch. In it, Gorsuch alluded to “a state’s legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process,” which “permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.” The decision is the culmination of a long-running effort to disqualify not just Trump but other Republicans over Jan. 6. Efforts to disqualify members of Congress including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and now-former congressman Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) failed, in part, because it was harder to directly attach them to the events of Jan. 6. But last year the effort notched what appeared to be the first disqualification under the 14th Amendment since the Civil War era: A New Mexico judge kicked Otero County Commissioner Couy Griffin   after Griffin was convicted of misdemeanor trespassing on Jan. 6. Previous efforts to disqualify Trump from the 2024 ballot have failed in Minnesota and Michigan.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/19/4-takeaways-colorado-supreme-courts-disqualifying-trump/,Washington Post,2023-12-19 21:36:00,
"The most scrutinized and analyzed free agency in MLB history ended Saturday afternoon, when Shohei Ohtani’s winding offseason journey ended a few miles from where it started in a record-setting contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ohtani announced the deal on Instagram as his representatives passed around its unthinkable terms:  . Until Saturday, Ohtani’s former Los Angeles Angels teammate Mike Trout had the richest contract in baseball history. It pays him $426.5 million over 12 seasons. The most scrutinized and analyzed free agency in MLB history ended Saturday afternoon, when Shohei Ohtani’s winding offseason journey ended a few miles from where it started in a record-setting contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ohtani announced the deal on Instagram as his representatives passed around its unthinkable terms:  . Until Saturday, Ohtani’s former Los Angeles Angels teammate Mike Trout had the richest contract in baseball history. It pays him $426.5 million over 12 seasons. Ohtani’s deal was long expected to break records. After all, every other massive baseball contract signed in the modern era paid its recipient to pitch or hit at an elite level. Ohtani can do both. But the $700 million the Dodgers committed to him — an even $70 million per year in average annual value — is far and above what even the most optimistic prognosticators expected. It assumes, at least in the most basic of calculations, that Ohtani will be worth about $35 million annually as a hitter and as a pitcher. For reference, only four players are earning that much as hitters: Aaron Judge, Trout, Carlos Correa and Anthony Rendon. Only six players have earned that much annually as pitchers: Max Scherzer, Justin Verlander, Jacob deGrom, Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg,  . In practice, the Dodgers are not paying Ohtani to pitch next season. The 29-year-old underwent his second elbow surgery in five years this fall, and the soonest he is expected to pitch again is 2025. Because of that injury and those that preceded it, the Dodgers cannot be sure how much pitching they will get from Ohtani during the deal. But Ohtani is the biggest star in the world and is now playing for one of the sport’s most prominent franchises. The Dodgers are paying him to hit and to pitch as much as he can. But more than anything, they are paying him to be an icon. And they will not be paying him as much annually as it seems. Ohtani’s deal contains what a person familiar with it referred to as “unprecedented deferrals” — the majority, that person said, of his annual salary. California taxes are high, and deferrals help with those. But in waiting to pay large chunks of Ohtani’s salary until after his playing years, the Dodgers also free up money to spend on his teammates now. Those teammates include former MVPs Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman as well as all-star catcher Will Smith and a familiar cast that has not missed the playoffs in a decade. While Ohtani spent years dodging questions about what he would prioritize in his long-term baseball home, he always made clear that he wanted to win. Few franchises have won as reliably in recent years — or seem positioned to continue winning in future ones — as the Dodgers. The other thing Ohtani always made clear was that he wanted to play for a team that would let him continue to pitch and hit when he is able. That he agreed to a deal with the Dodgers suggests Los Angeles — an organization not exactly prone to letting one player dictate its direction — is willing to let him try for as long as he feels he can. The Dodgers are certainly paying him like a player they expect to pitch again at some point: More complete hitters have signed for far less annually than Ohtani did. What Ohtani will be able to give the Dodgers as a pitcher remains to be seen. He had Tommy John surgery in 2018 and  . When he has been healthy, Ohtani has been dominant. Until he injured that elbow again in 2023, the right-hander had compiled three elite seasons in which he pitched to a 2.84 ERA while averaging more than 11 strikeouts per nine innings and just more than 5⅔ innings per start. But even if he is limited on the mound moving forward, Ohtani is unprecedented. He has grown into one of MLB’s most powerful left-handed hitters with a .922 OPS and a .274 batting average, both of which are well below the numbers he put up when he finally got healthy and comfortable in the past three years. Since the start of the 2021 season, Ohtani has won two American League MVP awards and could have won another, maintained a .964 OPS and averaged more than 40 homers and drove in nearly 100 runs per season in an Angels lineup that was not as deep as the one he is joining. When Ohtani shared his Instagram post Saturday — topped with the Dodgers logo, his message clear — it ended a wild few weeks of speculation conducted by an industry that had only a blurry picture of what its greatest star really wanted. His free agency, like his career, had developed into something baseball had never seen. When the two-way star from Japan was posted for MLB teams to sign six years ago, before he proved himself as one of the game’s best starters and power hitters all in one, there was widespread intrigue. But as the end of his deal with the Angels approached this year,  , there was a frenzy. In that frenzy, the Dodgers were long considered the favorites, though “favorites” was always a loose term because, whatever anyone said, no one really knew what Ohtani wanted. For years, he dodged questions about where he would want to be, and handicapping the race was made difficult by its secrecy this offseason. Ohtani,  , did not address the media for months, and his representatives doggedly avoided providing hints of his intentions. Because of his familiarity with Southern California and their seemingly endless financial resources, the Dodgers always seemed most certain to make a credible push. They were the first team to admit meeting with Ohtani this offseason, though at times that seemed as if  . The Toronto Blue Jays reportedly flew Ohtani to their spring training facility in Dunedin, Fla., for a recent meeting. The San Francisco Giants, who also have money to spend and a need to inject their franchise with superstar energy, reportedly met with him, too. The Angels wanted to bring him back, if possible. At times, rumors spread that Ohtani wanted to stay on the West Coast, to play with a fellow Japanese player, not to play with a fellow Japanese player and so on. The Chicago Cubs seemed to make a real push. The New York teams never seemed to bite, and the Seattle Mariners, who once seemed to make sense, started cutting payroll in ways that indicated they would not be able to afford a record deal. But in the end, the Dodgers were always there. They would allow Ohtani to stay in an area he knows well and guaranteed him the chance to win as much as any franchise can. He will join a lineup that already includes Betts and Freeman, one that already cleared the designated hitter spot for him when it signed J.D. Martinez to a one-year deal before last season instead of finding a long-term fit. And after he recovers from elbow surgery, he is slated to join a Dodgers rotation that relied largely on prospects last year and could use a few new anchors moving forward. More importantly, one of the top baseball players of the modern era will join one of its top franchises, a logical alignment of star and market that should yield endorsement deals and television revenue, sell merchandise and put one of the game’s most storied players in one of its most storied stadiums. Many of baseball’s transcendent players have worn a Dodgers uniform. The most legendary player of this generation will join them.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/09/shohei-ohtani-signs-dodgers/,Washington Post,2023-12-09 17:17:00,

But there is no escaping his past when he lives a short walk from its charred remains.

He remarried, raised two sons. “My new family,” he calls them. But there is no escaping his past when he lives a short walk from its charred remains. Across the former Yugoslavia, poignant museums commemorate the wars sparked during the splintering of the six republics and two autonomous regions once held together by a fragile socialist bond. Bosnia has at least five museums about the war; Croatia has three. Serbia has one. Kosovo has none. Earlier this year, nearly 25 years after war ended, the Ministry of Culture announced plans to develop one. For now, the history is preserved in privately-owned sites, like the ruins of the home where Muqolli’s first family once lived. As memories fade, evidence of the war has survived only because Muqolli and other Kosovars safeguard it. The night of April 16, 1999, plays over and over in Muqolli’s head. At the time, Kosovo was a province of Serbia, with an ethnic Albanian majority and Serbian minority. When Albanian Kosovars launched a rebellion in 1998, the Serbian military and ethnic Serbian police officers carried out massacres that left some 13,500 people dead or missing. That night, Muqolli’s parents, siblings, wife and four children had gathered for safety in the house that his father built in the village of Poklek. Muqolli left the forest where his unit of guerrilla soldiers was fighting to visit. They ate and talked until 2 a.m., when he stealthily returned to his position. The next day, 53 people staying in the house were killed by grenades and bullets fired by uniformed policemen, witnesses later recounted. The structure was set on fire, and most of the bodies were reduced to bone. Today, Muqolli, a soft-spoken man with cropped gray hair and wide hands, goes to work installing phone and internet lines, and returns each night to his new wife and sons, a few blocks from the shell of his old house. He never considered tearing it down. For nearly 25 years, he has preserved it as a public memorial to his family and to the war. Walking up a stone path from the roadside, he travels back in time. At the end of the lane, trees sagging with plums nearly hide the tall house. “When I come here,” he said. “I see my family again.” In the room where his family was killed, his voice drops to a whisper. “To visit this home is terrible,” he said. “It’s so painful even for a common visitor, let alone me: A father, brother, and son.” A belt buckle, a child’s shoe, and bullet casings still lie in the rubble. The responsibility of tour guide and caretaker makes him ill, he said. He has trouble sleeping. His thoughts are dark and depressed. But if he does not do it, no one else will. “My children’s bones are here,” he said. Just as Muqolli has reconstructed his life, Kosovo, too, has rebuilt. In 2008, nine years after a NATO bombing campaign ended the war, Kosovo declared its independence. A flood of international aid helped lay its foundation, and construction is everywhere. Yet reminders of the conflict are unavoidable: War veterans march in the capital every few weeks, ensuring their sacrifices are not forgotten. Granite monuments to fallen soldiers dot cities and the countryside. Even so, evidence is slipping away. “Why is there no museum to the war?” said Bekim Blakaj, the executive director of the Humanitarian Law Center Kosovo, which collects documentation of wartime crimes. “We will lose the narrative and the memory of what happened.” In the dimly lit National Museum in Pristina, the capital, there is no account of the bloodshed, the destroyed cities, or the refugee crisis that displaced half the country. A rebel leaders’ burned-out compound is preserved by the government, along with a small museum and a cemetery. But to learn about the civilian toll, a visitor must seek out Muqolli and the few others who have saved their own small pieces of the war. In the small city of Gjakova, known for its dervishes of Islam’s mystical Sufi order, sits Kosovo’s most famous private museum: the Qerkezi house, a neat, two-story home adorned with a red-and-black Albanian flag. Ferdonije Qerkezi lives alone now, but she once shared this home with her husband, their four sons, and two daughters-in-law. She slowly climbs the stairs to her sons’ bedrooms, where their beds, clothes, toys, and photographs are wrapped in plastic. Matching tuxedos hang in the wardrobe; her husband, a tailor, made them for their sons’ joint wedding. Qerkezi sits heavily on a beige couch and launches into a history she has spent more than two decades reciting to visitors. It never gets easier. “It’s beyond words to describe the pain and deep sadness of telling the story of how your family was taken away and murdered,” she said, her breathing labored. “I don’t know if there are words.” On April 27, 1999, a Serb police officer came to Qerkezi’s house and took her husband and sons — the youngest was 14 — for questioning. Qerkezi waited for her family’s return and did not change a thing in the house. Every night, for the first two years after the war ended, she set a dinner table for six. Word of her vigil spread and visitors began to come. Aid workers, dignitaries, even presidents. In 2005, the bodies of her youngest and oldest sons were found in a mass grave in Serbia; her husband and other sons are still missing. In 2008, the house was declared a museum by the municipality, but aside from free utilities and donated glass cabinets, Qerkezi gets no assistance. Asked why there is no war museum in Kosovo, she grew angry. “Why didn’t I do it on my own? It’s just because I can’t fit all war crimes in one house,” she said. “Why didn’t the state do it?” At family-run museums across the country, proprietors repeat the same words to describe what they’ve preserved: “proof,” “evidence,” “testimony.” Serbia has long denied wrongdoing and most families still do not know who was responsible for killing their loved ones. Some still hope to achieve justice in court. Anne Gilliland, a professor at UCLA who has studied private museums across the Balkans, calls them archives. “The family members there are living documents themselves,” Gilliland said. For a decade after the war, Kosovo was governed by a United Nations-appointed international coalition. “They were not interested in collective memory,” said Baki Svirca, a historian who is helping the government create an official narrative of the war. “They were much more interested in keeping the status quo and peace.” Svirca has been studying war museums from North Carolina to Israel. He particularly admires how the Jewish community has memorialized the Holocaust, while using it as a tool for education. He hopes one day Kosovars can replicate that model. Kosovo’s minister of culture, Hajrulla Çeku, said plans for one or more official museums will be drafted next year “to present a comprehensive history of crimes” but declined to comment on why previous governments did not start the task. For now, those stories are being preserved by whatever means possible. In the small city of Suhareka, a storefront pockmarked with bullet holes and scorch marks sits in a strip mall. The door is locked but there is a phone number posted outside, and soon a lanky, white-haired man appears jangling a key ring. The man, Hysni Berisha, said this was a pizzeria, where 44 members of his extended family were shot and burned by Serbian forces. Their bodies were later unearthed from a mass grave in Serbia. The owner gave Berisha the shop and he left it as it was. Last year, with a donation from a local energy drink company, he encased the bullet-scarred walls in glass and built an elevated walkway over the rubble-strewn floor. “I’ve never been interested in keeping this for the state, or the city, or myself,” he said. “My idea is to keep it for the next generations. Reconciliation might come but this should never be forgotten.” In another country, he said, the site might have become a museum with a memorial park for reflection. Instead, it is squeezed next to a gaming parlor that echoes with clacks from a foosball table. The bodies of some children killed here were never found, he said. Sometimes they appear in his dreams, asking if anyone is looking for them. “I have a lot of voices in my head,” he said. When there is an official war museum in Kosovo, it will struggle to disentangle fact from hatred. Most of the war’s victims were ethnic Albanians, but Serbs, Roma, and others also suffered. Just as Serbia largely denies Kosovo’s accounts of the war, Kosovo often ignores these other victims. In the basement of a student library in Pristina, a wall is covered with the names of all 1,133 children killed or missing in wartime. Their clothing, toys, and books are displayed in glass cases by the Humanitarian Law Center, which has compiled a file for each victim. Those stories led to an exhibit called “Once Upon a Time and Never Again,” which opened in 2019. It was meant to run for a year, but victims’ families kept visiting, bringing relatives and friends. The staff felt they could not close. In one glass case are notebooks filled with the neat penmanship of Fadil Muqolli’s murdered children. Muqolli’s eldest “new” son is now 19, part of the first generation to grow up in an independent Kosovo. At times, Muqolli said he feels guilty that he started another family and burdened it with his past. Recently, the government pledged to renovate his house and hire a docent. His son has begun helping at the museum. He hopes they both can step out from the war’s shadow but not forget it. “This house,” he said, “is a piece of the new history of our country.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/kosovo-homes-war-museums-survivors/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 01:00:00,
"In its past life, the Webster School in downtown Washington had been many things: a segregated school for White children built in 1882, an “Americanization” school for assimilating immigrants after World War I, a rehabilitation school for pregnant teens in the latter half of the 20th century. But since the 1980s, the Webster School has been a vacant, boarded-up, red-brick building in the middle of a busy downtown corridor, its double doors stained with age and wear. In its past life, the Webster School in downtown Washington had been many things: a segregated school for White children built in 1882, an “Americanization” school for assimilating immigrants after World War I, a rehabilitation school for pregnant teens in the latter half of the 20th century. But since the 1980s, the Webster School has been a vacant, boarded-up, red-brick building in the middle of a busy downtown corridor, its double doors stained with age and wear. Owned by the federal government, Webster has stood as a visible reminder of the impact of vacant or underutilized federal buildings in the District, a problem that local leaders and congressional lawmakers have scrutinized with escalating intensity after the pandemic upended in-person office work. But now, the historic building might get a new lease on life: The federal General Services Administration announced this month that it plans to  , the former Homeland Security headquarters complex on Nebraska Avenue, as part of a strategy to downsize its federal footprint, identify unused or underused federal real estate and save taxpayers millions of dollars. The action from GSA follows months of calls from Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) for the Biden administration to either make significantly better use of vacant or underused federal buildings or to let the District do something with them — especially as D.C. seeks to revitalize its ailing downtown. As part of D.C.’s forthcoming Downtown Action Plan that Bowser   this spring, the mayor has broached transforming vacant federal or private office buildings into housing, luring or expanding universities and other means to attract more residents and visitors. Although that plan is still in the works, D.C. officials said the two federal buildings could pose significant redevelopment opportunities for the city while breathing new life into the Webster, aligning with the downtown reboot. “It’s really a prime site,” said Gerren Price, president and CEO of the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, which is helping to develop the plan. “And my hope is that it becomes just the start to many more of these federal buildings that could become just real beacons of hope and development for downtown.” The building is located on H and 10th streets NW near Chinatown — a corridor that has in some ways embodied the challenges downtown D.C. has faced since the pandemic sent workers home and emptied streets. Nearby businesses have closed, Price said. Crime has increased, prompting calls from the BID for a stronger police presence. But while the area near Capital One Arena has seen lots of change over the years, one constant has been the boarded-up Webster. Once owned by the D.C. school system, it went up for sale in the 1990s. One interested buyer wanted to demolish it and turn it into an office tower, prompting a campaign by preservationists to designate the building a local historic landmark in 1999. That victory for the preservationists derailed the office makeover for the school — but the next interested buyer, the Secret Service, whose headquarters is right next door, only complicated the building’s future. Worried in the aftermath of 9/11 that the vacant building could pose a security threat, the Secret Service wanted to use the building for its own purposes. The GSA took the building through eminent domain in 2003 — but the Secret Service never did anything with the Webster School despite agreeing to seek funding to restore it. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) began applying pressure years later, calling on the GSA to either use or sell the building in 2013 — but having the Secret Service as a neighbor  . As the building continued to languish, Norton introduced legislation in July with Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) that would compel the GSA to sell the building. “We can’t afford to have a valuable property in downtown D.C. vacant,” Norton said, noting she still wants to push her bill forward. “We should be able to generate tax revenue from this building.” In a statement Wednesday, the GSA said it had initiated outreach to the District on the Webster School and Nebraska Avenue Complex, and would have more information to share in the coming months on plans to transfer or sell these assets move forward. The federal agency has increasingly looked for ways to consolidate space and dispose of assets it no longer needs, partly due to the proliferation of remote work: In July, a   from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found “extreme underutilization” among 24 federal agency headquarters, many of which are near the White House and National Mall. The GAO found that 17 of those agency headquarters were filled at 25 percent capacity or less during three separate weeks between January and March this year. In response, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week approved bills intended to address low office space utilization. One measure, called the Federal Use it or Lose it Leases Act, introduced by Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.), requires the GSA’s tenant agencies to return space if their utilization rates fall below 60 percent for six months over a one-year span. (Norton told The Washington Post in an interview that she supported this legislation, but Norton had voted against it by voice vote during the markup. She noted in a later interview she got mixed up.) In congressional oversight hearings earlier this year, the GSA official then in charge of public buildings said the agency understood “what the District is trying to do with its downtown, and we’re trying to make sure that strategically, our assets can contribute to the vitality of downtown.” That official, Nina Albert, was   to be her deputy mayor of planning and economic development, joining the District government at a critical time as the Downtown Action Plan is in the works. Albert said officials have not yet discussed plans to consider buying either Webster or the Nebraska Avenue Complex. But she said the city would seek to partner with the federal government to identify potential developers and rezone the properties to make them suitable for new uses. “What we want to do is partner and introduce the federal government to people who we know might be interested, so that the federal government can see, what could the opportunity be?” Albert said. “Could it be a retailer, could it be a museum? Could it be residential? What does that look like? And show them that there is a market.” D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said city government can play a role in the federal efforts to downsize by a having a vision for properties as they are identified, suggesting housing as one possibility for the Webster School. Plus, now that the GSA is planning to  , Mendelson said the massive J. Edgar Hoover Building downtown could also be a target for private development with a range of possibilities, including commercial, hotel and residential. “To me, the greatest opportunity is if we take the initiative in developing a vision,” Mendelson said. “My sense is that the feds are still disorganized in how much they want to downsize, when and where, and still sorting it out. And we could bring some leadership to that.” As for the District’s broader revitalization vision, Albert said the Downtown Action Plan will seek to leverage downtown D.C.’s existing strengths, such as trying to attract businesses that thrive in proximity to the federal government. But while the federal government will always be important to the city core, she said, it doesn’t have to be the only anchor. “We also have other anchors, and that’s what the plan starts to identify,” she said. “Our universities are incredibly strong, as well as our hospital and medical ecosystem, and we’re exploring how to meet the needs of those industries better.” Kevin Clinton, chief program officer for the Federal City Council, a nonprofit business and civic group that has also contributed to the action plan, said that telework, high financing costs and   have been the primary contributors to downtown’s uncertain outlook. And while there was optimism earlier this year that in-office mandates from private companies as well as   by the Office of Management and Budget to increase in-person work among federal employees would dampen the impact of telework, he said, the difference so far has felt marginal. According to data collected by Kastle Systems, which measures traffic at offices through access cards, the percentage of workers who showed up at their offices in downtown D.C. was about 43.7 percent in October, a slight increase compared to October 2022 (41.7 percent) but nowhere near the 98.2 percent in February 2020, a month before the pandemic started. “People are coming back, but they aren’t coming back with a vengeance,” Clinton said. Clinton noted that he was encouraged by a provision passed by the D.C. Council in the spring to incentivize more office-to-residential conversion projects. Price, the DowntownDC BID president, said he is tracking 23 such projects, four of which are under active construction. Price added that while return-to-work figures have been less than inspiring,  , pedestrian traffic downtown and   are signs that “there’s still a great interest in all of the other things the downtown has to offer outside of spaces to do your job.” Clinton and Price said recommendations in the Downtown Action Plan will focus on trying to attract people downtown in part by enlivening green spaces — Price pointed to the   as a success — and increasing the kinds of amenities and needs that could draw residents, such as grocery stores and educational opportunities. While the plan was expected to be released this month, Price said they extended the period for public engagement after significant interest during public meetings, and it’s now expected to be released in early 2024. Mendelson said he would be looking for recommendations to boost public safety in high-trafficked corridors as well as short-term economic strategies that could make a difference in the next year or two, such as pop-up events that could take advantage of vacant retail spaces. “We’ve learned with the pandemic, we’ve got to have a greater diversity of uses in our downtown,” Mendelson said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/29/dc-downtown-webster-school/,Washington Post,2023-11-29 06:00:00,

Tender reunions. A bountiful spread. Little ones meeting relatives for the first time. There are plenty of reasons to be a shutterbug this holiday season, but don’t let those memories be marred because your phone’s camera lenses are grimy. From our little Help Desk family to yours, consider this a friendly reminder to wipe down those cameras whenever you can, to ensure your precious photos aren’t hazy and full of halos. In our experience, the best way to do this is to give those lenses a quick, circular wipe-down with a microfiber cloth. Don’t forget to give those front camera(s) a cleaning, too — it’ll give you sharper selfies. If you wear glasses, you probably have one of these cloths already. They also frequently come with some phone accessories, like screen protectors. You can also use premoistened lens wipes, which often come in packs of 50 or 100. Many of them are made of paper, so don’t feel the need to press too hard when you’re wiping — and stop once they start to (quickly) dry out. In case you were wondering, no — traditional wet wipes aren’t a good substitute. They often contain moisturizers and other additives that can actually make your lenses even messier. If you don’t have any of these things on-hand, don’t worry: A sleeve will do in a pinch (as long as you aren’t wearing anything coarse). This could take a bit longer, as dry fabric tends to push grease and schmutz around — if you’re really having trouble getting those lenses clean, exhaling on them before wiping them down usually helps.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/23/clean-camera-lens/,Washington Post,2023-12-23 06:00:00,
"Alexandria Mayor Justin M. Wilson (D) will not seek reelection next year, he announced Friday, capping off two terms in which he pushed to embrace urban development and steered the Northern Virginia city through the   pandemic — and opening up what will likely be a hotly contested primary race in June. Alexandria Mayor Justin M. Wilson (D) will not seek reelection next year, he announced Friday, capping off two terms in which he pushed to embrace urban development and steered the Northern Virginia city through the   pandemic — and opening up what will likely be a hotly contested primary race in June. Wilson, 44, made the announcement in the lengthy, often wonky newsletter he sends out on the first of every month — a hallmark of the plugged-in, tech-savvy style he employed in more than a decade in local government. “We’ve accomplished some enormous things. I love this job, and I would do it forever if I could,” he said in an interview earlier this week. But “this is a lot harder when you don’t have the ability to pull all-nighters every night, and I never intended to do this forever.” First elected to Alexandria City Council in 2007, Wilson never gave up his day job as a senior director at Amtrak — even as he became known for talking policy with some residents mid-jog at   and answering emails from others in the middle of the night. Alexandria school board member Abdel S. Elnoubi (District C) called him “one of the most passionate, tireless & dedicated public servants I’ve witnessed"" in a post on social media. As a policymaker, Wilson often pushed to update the city’s infrastructure and lean into urban growth, working to bring   and   to Potomac Yard, funding plans to build five new schools and securing a deal to   on the city’s West End into a hospital. That set of development-minded priorities led him to   but also made him a frequent subject of criticism from some residents who clashed with his at-times brash approach. Just this week, the council   a hotly debated package of zoning changes that could bring duplexes and townhouses to more suburban single-family neighborhoods. While a cadre of young renters, interfaith groups and tenants’ associations cheered that plan, longtime homeowners accused Wilson of colluding with developers and claimed the plan will overwhelm their neighborhoods. Bill Rossello, president of the Seminary Hill Association, said Wilson had an “authoritative and divisive” style that had divided the city and made many longtime residents feel discredited. “He doesn’t treat people with respect when they disagree with him,"" said Rossello, who has often criticized Wilson’s agenda. “He does exactly the opposite."" Wilson drew similar complaints — and praise — for other hotly debated projects, such an effort to  on Seminary Road, which some neighbors said would lead to greater traffic, or a push for   to fix eroding waterways, which they claimed would cut down trees. Sandy Marks, chair of the Alexandria Democratic Committee, said the criticism was merely a sign that he had been making “courageous” moves that past leaders had been too shy to take on. “Anytime you’re pushing bold, progressive, anti-racist policy, you may be called controversial,"" Marks said. “He’s been a real leader, unabashedly speaking out when he should instead of playing it safe."" Wilson’s exit is likely to create a competitive Democratic primary in June, when the mayor’s office and all six other seats on City Council will be up for grabs. Alexandria has a weak-mayor system, which means that the part-time job’s main policy-marking function is presiding over the council. Both Vice Mayor Amy B. Jackson (D) and Council member Alyia Gaskins (D) have indicated they would consider running to succeed Wilson, though neither has made an official announcement. Some have also floated the possibility of former mayor Allison Silberberg — whom Wilson defeated in the last two primaries — trying to win her old job back. (Alexandria   a Republican candidate for mayor in more than a century and a half, and whoever secures the Democratic nomination will be heavily favored to win in the deep-blue city.) A onetime civic activist involved with the Del Ray Citizens’ Association, Wilson won a special election to fill a city council seat well over a decade ago, when he was 28. He lost his first reelection bid but made it back onto council in 2012 and has been serving in elected office since. He began sending   during his first year on the body, eventually gaining 15,000 subscribers in information-hungry Alexandria with thousand-word missives that covered everything from Metro funding and the state legislature to sewer and street repairs in painstaking detail. His action-oriented style also earned a reputation for being impatient on the dais. As vice mayor, he   to limit the public comment portion of city council meetings; at other times, he was criticized for texting or posting on social media while residents were testifying. Wilson stressed that in his online way, he had tried to make himself accessible to residents, even while advocating for policies or tax hikes that some of them resisted. “The reality is most people are living their lives, and local government is not something that gets on their radar a great deal,” he said. “I always want to be human to folks so that they don’t feel like I’m this nebulous entity.” Wilson said his announcement was not timed to follow the controversial zoning vote. He also swatted away rumors that he is eventually preparing to run for the congressional seat held by Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.).  The two men have known each other since the future mayor was a teenager and working as a state Senate page for Beyer, who was then Virginia’s lieutenant governor. Beyer, an Alexandria resident, joined a chorus of Northern Virginia officials who took to social media to praise Wilson for his long stint in city politics. “He’s been my Councilman, my Mayor, and my friend for time out of mind, and he’s done so much for Alexandria,” the congressman   on X, formerly known as Twitter. Without city council meetings to lead and a packed schedule of events to preside over, Wilson confessed that he was at a loss for what he would do with all his newfound free time. “It’s absolutely terrifying,” he said. “I’m going to want to find something where I can give back and be involved … The good news is, I have a year-plus to figure that out.” If nothing else, he said, there would be a lot more time at home with his daughter, a high school sophomore, and impromptu travel with his wife. Asked if he would keep sending out his newsletter, he said he wasn’t planning on it past December 2024. But, he added, anything was possible.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/01/justin-wilson-alexandria-mayor-reelection/,Washington Post,2023-12-01 07:00:00,
"Week 16 delivered clarity through a series of sudden jolts. The MVP had a clear front-runner in Brock Purdy, and then Lamar Jackson snatched the award out of his hands with help from his defense. The 49ers were the NFL’s clear juggernaut, and then the Ravens blasted them off their home field. The 2024 draft order appeared set, and then a 56-yard field goal jumbled spots two through four. Week 16 delivered clarity through a series of sudden jolts. The MVP had a clear front-runner in Brock Purdy, and then Lamar Jackson snatched the award out of his hands with help from his defense. The 49ers were the NFL’s clear juggernaut, and then the Ravens blasted them off their home field. The 2024 draft order appeared set, and then a 56-yard field goal jumbled spots two through four. In the NFL, clarity is always fleeting. Here is what to know.  Teams have traded the title of Super Bowl favorite around like a hot potato all season, and the Ravens will have to beat the Dolphins in Baltimore next week to maintain their place at the top of the league. But they left no doubt they deserve it with their Christmas night bludgeoning of the 49ers, a 33-19 demolition on the road that made Jackson the clear MVP favorite. The Ravens have led in the fourth quarter of every game they have played, haven’t lost by more than seven points and own a plus-173 point differential. They are an absolute powerhouse. The Ravens throttled the 49ers’ luminous offense because they possess the defensive version of the 49ers’ offense: waves of stars at every level. Defensive tackle Justin Madubuike, linebacker Roquan Smith, safety Kyle Hamilton and cornerback Marlon Humphrey are among the elite at their positions, and they’re supported by solid players everywhere within rising star defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald’s system. Their blend of experience, skill and brainpower led Monday night to five interceptions, four of them of Purdy before the Ravens knocked him out of the game with a vicious hit. Baltimore’s defense cleared the way for Jackson to claim the lead in the MVP race with two games left. Unlike in 2019, when he ran away with the award, Jackson does not own the typical statistical résumé of an MVP. But his renewed style under first-year offensive coordinator Todd Monken allows him to hold every game in the palm of his hand. He patiently bounces in the pocket, darting around pass rushers and forcing the secondary to cover receivers for a relative eternity. He ranks outside the top 10 in passing yards (3,357) and has thrown just 19 touchdown passes, but he dominates every play he is on the field. “Anyone that watches football and knows football [can] see the type of impact he has on the game — not even stat-wise but just individually,” Smith told reporters Monday night.  There was reason to believe the Chiefs would snap out of the offensive malaise that enveloped them during the middle of the season. Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid have slain every dragon in their path for years. Mahomes has been particularly adept at working new receivers into Kansas City’s system. Rookie wideout Rashee Rice was emerging. They were the  , for crying out loud. Even  . But Kansas City’s ghastly performance in a 20-14 home loss to the Raiders may have squeezed the last drops of optimism out of their season. The Chiefs lost 10 yards on their first three drives, surrendered two defensive touchdowns and generated 4.2 yards per play. Judging by his style of play, Mahomes has no trust in his offensive line, his receivers, his play caller and probably his water boy. Often, he drops back and essentially disregards the play, his eyes on the pass rush and his instincts telling him nobody is open downfield as he drifts back and attempts to make something out of nothing. The majority of snaps end with Mahomes scrambling near the sideline, making a throw that straddles the line between brilliant and reckless. It is no way to run an offense. For all the justified hand-wringing over the Chiefs’ wideouts, the biggest difference in their offense may be the effectiveness of Travis Kelce. In his age-34 season, Kelce has been merely very good and not the best pass-catching weapon in the NFL. His decline, even if he remains productive, has exposed the Chiefs’ dearth of skill at wideout and left Mahomes without a partner who can take over games. Kelce’s 10.8 yards per catch is the lowest of his career, and he has surpassed 100 yards in only two games, something he did six times last season. The Chiefs are 3-5 in the past eight games, averaging 19.4 points over that span. At 9-6, they have already ensured their worst record of Mahomes’s tenure. They are squandering a superlative defense; the Raiders passed for 62 yards Monday and scored on just two offensive possessions, both field goals. The dismal AFC West has kept Kansas City safely in first place, but the Chiefs will have to go on the road in the playoffs for the first time in Mahomes’s career — and they may have to beat the Bills in the first round to even get there. Bet against Mahomes at your own peril, still. But the Chiefs may be in for an unfamiliar reckoning.  Dallas seemed like a changed franchise when it blasted the Eagles, 33-13, earlier this month, standing tall in a crucial spot against a quality rival. Then came the past two weeks. The Cowboys wilted against the Bills and Dolphins, scoring 30 points in two losses and probably blowing a chance to win the NFC East. The Eagles have their own problems, but they need only to beat the Cardinals and Giants to clinch. The Cowboys are a different team at home and on the road. They are 3-5 away from AT&T Stadium with victories against the Giants, Chargers and Panthers while averaging 21.5 points, compared with 39.9 at home. That’s bad news for a team likely to spend the entire playoffs on the road. Given the Cowboys’ track record, they would be vulnerable against the Buccaneers, their projected first-round opponent.  The Bucs were expected to bottom out, contend for one of the top picks and choose their permanent post-Tom Brady replacement in the draft. They may have found their quarterback of the future in a much different way. The Bucs signed Mayfield to a one-year, $4 million contract with incentives, and he has shown flashes of the talent that made him the No. 1 pick in 2018. The Buccaneers are in command of the NFC South after thumping the Jaguars, 30-12, for their fourth straight victory. Over the past three games, Mayfield has completed 67.4 percent of his passes, averaging 269.3 yards, and has thrown for eight touchdowns and zero interceptions. In his postgame news conference Sunday, Mayfield said he “would love” to return to the Buccaneers next season. It would make sense for Tampa Bay. Mayfield is just 28, and he is on pace to throw for more than 4,000 yards. The Browns gave up on Mayfield only after he played through a severe shoulder injury. The Panthers have proved to be a situation inhospitable to winning football. In a brief cameo with the Rams last season, Mayfield showed glimpses of his best self. Now he’s playing better than ever and headed for a home playoff game. The Buccaneers can clinch the division this week with a victory over the Saints at home.  In what was supposed to be a year to reset the salary cap and rebuild the roster after years of chasing Super Bowls at the expense of the future, the Rams are 8-7 and in playoff position after their convincing, 30-22 victory over the Saints on Thursday. Rams General Manager Les Snead has received credit for savvy drafting, and he deserves it. The Rams have harvested quality depth in late rounds, and landing Puka Nacua — who gained another 164 receiving yards Thursday — in the fifth round was a franchise-changer. But the Rams are winning mostly because the most important figures from their Super Bowl season are still around. Aaron Donald is still a menace who makes the game easier for every teammate because of the blocking resources that opponents must allocate to contain him. Cooper Kupp, though diminished by injury, is still an elite wideout. Coach Sean McVay has proved he remains a step ahead on offense. Most of all, Matthew Stafford has been one of the best players in the NFL. With   and Kirk Cousins shelved, Stafford, 35, is carrying the torch for the Manning-Brady-Brees-Rivers-Ryan-Roethlisberger brand of aging quarterback that predominated over the past decade. Among the top 14 quarterbacks in passing yardage, only Stafford is older than 30. He still has the same explosive, elastic arm as ever. Would Nacua be an instant star if he didn’t have Stafford to exploit his skills? With Stafford and McVay leading the way, the Rams have won five of six and look like a terrifying first-round playoff matchup.  The man who likes to say “the standard is the standard” offered a reminder Saturday: Mike Tomlin is still Mike Tomlin. After George Pickens’s poor effort and the Steelers’ overall lethargy led to a three-game losing streak, many questioned whether Tomlin still had his usual control of his team. On Saturday, the Steelers smoked the Bengals, 34-11, to keep their wild-card hopes alive in the jumbled AFC. They galvanized around third-string quarterback Mason Rudolph, who passed for 290 yards. Pickens, rightfully criticized all week, caught four passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns, including an 86-yarder on Pittsburgh’s opening possession. The Steelers have must-win games in Seattle and Baltimore to finish the season, a daunting task even if the Ravens could have the top seed locked up by Week 18. They still have plenty of questions, starting with why their offense looked so much crisper with Rudolph than with alleged franchise quarterback Kenny Pickett. But the notion that Tomlin was losing his grip on the steering wheel can be put to bed.  For any franchise, that would be a worthy accomplishment. For the Lions, it is earthshaking. The Lions won the NFC North for the first time since the formation of the division, clinching it Sunday with a 30-24 victory over the Vikings. They will play their first home playoff game since January 1994. Build our legacy now  General Manager Brad Holmes and Coach Dan Campbell deserve credit for a methodical rebuild that took only three seasons. Holmes jump-started it with the brilliant trade of Stafford, acquiring a haul of draft capital and Jared Goff from the Rams at a time when the roster required a reboot. Holmes had been part of the front office that drafted Goff No. 1 with the Rams, and his faith in Goff even after a rocky season in Los Angeles has paid off. Campbell has fostered an aggressive, tough team and allowed handpicked coordinator Ben Johnson to build one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL. It would require an unexpected slip by the 49ers, whose 9-1 conference record puts them in the driver’s seat, but the Lions are not out of the running for the NFC’s top seed. No matter which seed they earn, no stadium will be louder or more joyous than Ford Field on the second weekend of January.  When Patriots kicker Chad Ryland booted a game-winning, 56-yard field goal Sunday night, he may have upended the entire offseason. The Patriots’ upset victory over the Broncos dropped them to fourth  , nudging the Commanders to third and the Cardinals to second behind the Bears, who own Carolina’s first-round pick. Caleb Williams and Drake Maye are widely viewed as potential franchise quarterbacks, almost certain to be the first two players chosen. The Bears and Cardinals already have first-round quarterbacks in place, though each has been tantalizing enough to want to keep and maddening enough to justify moving on from. Would the Bears rather have Justin Fields and another massive haul of draft capital or their choice of Williams or Maye and a few second-day picks? Down the stretch, Fields has shown improved processing and accuracy as a passer while still using the running skills that make him one of the best ballcarriers in the NFL at any position. Given how he’s playing and the ceiling he has yet to reach, it would be difficult for the Bears to part with him. In the end, though, salary cap considerations may make the decision for the Bears. They will have to pay Fields soon, with Daniel Jones’s four-year, $160 million extension with the Giants probably providing a baseline. They could build around Williams or Maye on a rookie contract. If Fields becomes available, he has played well enough to create a bidding war among quarterback-needy teams. The Cardinals face a similar calculus, although Murray has accomplished more than Fields and his contract status makes him harder to move on from. The Cardinals appear more likely to build around their quarterback, but the coach-GM tandem of Jonathan Gannon and Monti Ossenfort didn’t pick Murray, and they may want to find their own guy. If the current order holds, it will be a fascinating offseason with wide-ranging ripple effects.  They did their level best Saturday night to squander an easy victory over the Chargers, committing three turnovers and blowing an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter. Once Tyler Bass booted a 29-yard field goal with 28 seconds left, though, nobody had a better Week 16 than the Bills. The Colts, Texans and Bengals lost, leaving the Bills as the only 9-6 wild-card team in the AFC. They have an 89 percent chance of making the playoffs, according to the New York Times’ calculations. If they can finish with victories over the Patriots and Dolphins, they have a chance to win the AFC East. Buffalo’s performance was disconcerting in how it surfaced the issues that dropped the team to 6-6 in the first place.   behind running back James Cook, but he gained only 3.5 yards per carry and fumbled. They couldn’t assert themselves along the lines, a problem they had seemingly solved. If that team shows up in the playoffs, its late-season charge will be moot. But the Bills, once in danger of falling out of the postseason, now have one foot in the playoffs.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/26/ravens-top-seed-chiefs-lose/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 09:30:00,
"The first thing South Lakes Coach Mike Desmond wants you to know about Jordan Scott is that Jordan Scott cannot hear you. That, of course, makes them needle for his attention even more. There’s the usual razzing from defenders who clap in his face and common folk who chant “o-ver-rated!” There’s the genuine curiosity — those who wonder if there is a glitch in the junior small forward’s system, who wonder what recruiting services see in a player who has never scored 30 points in a high school game and rarely dunks in so much as a pregame layup line. There are times when the ridicule has become weird and personal; during the playoffs last season, a rival team’s fans made a meme with his mom’s face on it. The first thing South Lakes Coach Mike Desmond wants you to know about Jordan Scott is that Jordan Scott cannot hear you. That, of course, makes them needle for his attention even more. There’s the usual razzing from defenders who clap in his face and common folk who chant “o-ver-rated!” There’s the genuine curiosity — those who wonder if there is a glitch in the junior small forward’s system, who wonder what recruiting services see in a player who has never scored 30 points in a high school game and rarely dunks in so much as a pregame layup line. There are times when the ridicule has become weird and personal; during the playoffs last season, a rival team’s fans made a meme with his mom’s face on it. It does not matter: He will not break that baby-faced stare. When he looks ahead, his eyes don’t pierce so much as they study. Perhaps that is where the paradox of Jordan Scott begins. He is a top-100 recruit and a product of Northern Virginia public schools, which have not featured a four-star talent since 2006. His physical and mental makeup have spurred more than a dozen high-major scholarship offers — he’s a 6-foot-7 springboard who guards every position, shoots lights-out and scores from any spot — and yet he remains the quietest player on the court. Teammates liken his game to that of Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo; he models his play after Candace Parker and wears a sleeve on his dominant leg and arm because of A’ja Wilson. His mom, WNBA and NCAA basketball broadcaster Christy Winters-Scott, has endeared him to the women’s game. “He knows he can be himself, and he respects that in others because he was given that respect,” Winters-Scott said. “He’s free-spirited. He’s not watered down or filtered out. He’s had that freedom to experiment who he is. He can be the person he wants to be, who also happens to play basketball.” Scott is the modern product of his local basketball roots. Last winter, he followed in the footsteps of his mom, sister and dad, all South Lakes graduates, by earning All-Met honors. (  was the player of the year in 1986.) His dad, Jerome Scott Sr., was a three-year starter at Miami; his mom played and coached at Maryland; his sister, Brianna, is one of the catalysts in  . At South Lakes, just two jerseys hang on the walls: those of Winters-Scott and Basketball Hall of Famer Grant Hill, who is endearingly called “Uncle Grant” in the Scott family.  Scott seems on track to add his No. 20. And, with a gifted roster by his side, the   (8-1) are within reach of the first state title in program history. Maybe then he’ll talk back — though only within the walls of his home. “He told me when he was an eighth-grader that he had to be better than ‘Uncle Grant,’ that he was winning us a state title and Grant never did,” Desmond said. “I’m being dead serious. He wants to be the best player to ever go to South Lakes so he can talk s--- with mom and dad, his brother and sister and Uncle Grant.” “He wants to break all our records,” Winters-Scott said. But what made Scott, a paradox of a player, so great? Winters-Scott raised her son with a different type of basketball education. As an assistant at Georgetown, she zipped and yelled around the bench, coaching while seven months pregnant. As an infant, Scott bobbed in a pouch on her stomach, facing outward toward her practices. He would eventually graduate to a seat on the floor, peering behind her right leg with Goldfish and a juice box in hand. Through the years, as Scott soaked up his surroundings, she encouraged him to lean into what appeared to be a creative and competitive disposition, a penchant for experimentation. When he was 5, he regularly stole his mom’s whiteboard in huddles and drew up plays for her teams. (They often worked, she recalls.) Since middle school, he has kept — and is still adding to — a book of his own plays. In elementary school, he picked out a blue-and-white ball from a bin at Target. For months, he dribbled it around the house and bounced it off the walls. Though it irked his dad, Winters-Scott would pull him aside and encourage him to keep it up. In middle school, he eschewed movie nights, preferring to stay up late watching film of the South Lakes girls’ team, which Winters-Scott coached to a state tournament appearance. These days, now preferring to experiment alone in the gym, he continues to test his limits. He also ends every game day with a film review. “You can tell he’s been around high-level basketball his whole life,” AAU coach Thomas Gadson said. “The game is really kind of easy for him. He understands things beyond the high school level. It’s at the high-major level.” In an early December game against reigning state champion Hayfield, the court still seemed like his playground. He charged down the lane and spun around a defender tossing a no-look assist. He tripped on a player’s foot and, before he hit the ground, added another 180 degrees, palmed the ball and tossed an underhanded pass. He played aggressive, catch-up defense, falling for a pump fake before pivoting back to the hoop and sending the layup attempt off the glass. Several minutes later, a player tried to test him from three-point range; he blocked that, too. And still, through it all, his expression never changed. Not when he was grabbed and nudged without a whistle, not on a rare miss or a sidestep three with a defender’s hands inches away from his retinas. He finished with an easy 15 points. “He goes about it quietly, and people who watch a game probably thought he sucked because he’s not taking off from 25 feet and dunking on you or doing any crazy, fancy, ankle-breaking moves,” Desmond said. “So I expect the same hate to be on him this year that was there last year: ‘Oh, he’s overrated and blah, blah, blah.’ And that’s fine. I really just think he’s like: ‘Cool, we won. You can say what you want.’ ” Says Scott: “Growing up and hearing ‘team basketball; make the extra pass’ five days a week, I guess it stuck.” Beneath the stoic look, does he like playing this way? Growing up, when his mom worked on Washington Mystics broadcasts, Scott was a staple at her side. He rebounded before games. One day, after watching Kristi Toliver’s one-legged fadeaway over and over, he poked then-coach Mike Thibault and took a shot of his own, asking if his fadeaway was like Toliver’s. Thibault said yes. The dimples emerged. In sixth grade, the Los Angeles Sparks came to town. Winters-Scott knew how much her son idolized Parker, knew that Parker knew of Scott from Instagram and tried to pull strings outside the locker room to let him meet her. She received pushback at the door before a voice called out: “Let Jordo in!” It was Parker. Winters-Scott put the ensuing photo of Scott, sandwiched between Parker and Nneka Ogwumike, on a sweatshirt that Scott wore to school. Through the years, Scott figures he has watched more of the women’s game than the men’s, though he remains an ardent NBA fan. But it wasn’t just what he watched; it was the intimacy with which he studied. Coaches said he saw the game differently, more purely, than his peers. He understood angles and how to play below the rim. South Lakes point guard Brian Kennedy said Scott always knows where to be on the court. Miles Franklin, an AAU teammate, said Scott has the best natural game sense he has ever seen. Two years ago, when Scott was a freshman, Desmond called him the smartest player he had coached in two decades. Now, Scott cites Parker as the biggest influence to his game. She’s positionless and unpredictable, a balanced weapon on offense and a former defensive player of the year. He changed his jersey number in AAU to No. 3, Parker’s number. Four minutes after a phone interview, he called back to blurt out, “Elena Delle Donne!” She, too, is an influence. “That knowledge lets him do certain things on the floor that frankly other guys are not even looking at,” said Gadson, who coached Scott this summer and watched him “more than hold his own” during college visits against high-major players. “It’s part of his DNA.” You’ll only see the dimples after games, once fans have filed out and only teammates, coaches and family are left. It’s a hidden part of Scott, same as his goofy, sarcastic sense of humor, his forte in the kitchen and his love of Marvel movies. Ultimately, it’s a testament to his values, which he keeps close to the vest. “Obviously family, friends and coaches, and people rooting for you,” Scott said when asked what he values. “And people that you know will have your back at any time obviously on the court and off the court. There’s someone that’s going to be there for you always rooting for you.” That’s why he trusts Desmond, who brings tougher love than many coaches but also traveled to Las Vegas this summer to watch Scott play — he had 16 blocks in an AAU game — and, like Scott and his mom, is up long past midnight watching film. That’s why Scott stayed at South Lakes with teammates who understand his wiring. When those people have had his back, it has been easy to focus on the controllables. For the Seahawks, it has been easy to follow his lead. The team is nearly spotless, save for a loss to No. 14 Patriot. Last season, after the Seahawks   and in one player’s words “lacked maturity,” they still made the state semifinals. This year, they’re assured. They’ve added transfers from Bishop O’Connell and another impact transfer from New Zealand. Kennedy and Sol Vita are two of the best undersized guards in the state. The last step, the Seahawks say, might be making Scott more selfish; he was taking just 11 shots per game and averaging 17.3 points entering Thursday. That could take some time. “I mean, I’m trying my best,” Scott said. “It’s just unnatural.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/hes-an-atypical-top-100-recruit-credit-his-mom-mind-wnba/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 08:00:00,

I like to imagine that the Jets kicker’s home is decorated with several of the   featured in “A Christmas Story.” Zuerlein, better known as “Greg the Leg,” turned the lights out on the Commanders’ comeback bid and delivered Washington fans an early Christmas present far superior to a Red Ryder BB gun by drilling a 54-yard field goal with five seconds remaining to put New York ahead for good. Zuerlein’s kick clinched the Commanders’ sixth straight loss after the Jets blew a 20-point halftime lead and   of securing a top-three pick in next year’s draft. Former Maryland kicker Chad Ryland’s last-minute, 56-yard field goal to lift the Patriots to a win over the Broncos on “Sunday Night Football” was another gift; it moved Washington ahead of New England and into   with two games to go. For a change, the long snapping wasn’t the problem for Washington’s special teams; Tucker Addington, who was signed to   last week, was perfectly adequate in his debut. The rest of special teams coordinator Nate Kaczor’s unit was a bigger nightmare than the words “some assembly required” at midnight on Christmas Eve. The Jets blocked a punt on Washington’s second possession after Jermaine Johnson II blew past Terrell Burgess, who somehow entered the day leading all special teams players in  . The Commanders’ Jamison Crowder lost a fumble after a 24-yard return in the second quarter, and Tariq Castro-Fields committed an encroachment penalty on a punt later in the first half to give New York a fresh set of downs. The Jets capitalized on Castro-Fields’s miscue to take a 27-7 lead. BLOCKED BY MAINE!!  |   on CBS  Commanders running back Brian Robinson Jr. missed his second consecutive game with a hamstring injury, leaving the rookie Rodriguez and Antonio Gibson to pick up the slack in the running game. Rodriguez made the most of his opportunity. The sixth-round pick out of Kentucky rushed for a career-high 58 yards on 10 carries, including his first two NFL touchdowns. Rodriguez demonstrated his strength on his first score, carrying a host of Jets defenders the final five yards on a 12-yard run with a push from his teammates. Rodriguez also showcased his athleticism by hurdling a defender on a 16-yard run that set up Washington’s go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter. First career TD for   👏 📺  : CBS  Howell’s receivers didn’t do him any favors. Curtis Samuel dropped Howell’s first pass, and Logan Thomas let Howell’s second pass slip through his hands and into the grasp of Jets safety Tony Adams for an interception. Samuel tripped at the top of his route on the play that resulted in Howell’s second interception midway through the third quarter, and that led to Howell being   for a second straight week. But Howell’s supporting cast was only part of the problem. The second-year quarterback, who has   and needed a bounce-back performance in the worst way, completed just 6 of 22 passes for 56 yards. Brissett moved the ball at will against New York’s defense, leading three straight touchdown drives. New York and Washington were in a giving mood: They combined for five turnovers. Sunday’s game featured an elite uniform matchup for Christmas Eve, with the Jets in their all-green duds and the Commanders in burgundy and white. It made for a festive scene at MetLife Stadium, even though the on-field product was generally unsightly. The Commanders fell to  , while the Jets, who were 1-6 on Dec. 24, won for the first time on the day before Christmas since Joe Namath passed for 343 yards and four touchdowns in a   in 1967. Who could blame people like my pal Cory for not starting the Jets’ running back in the fantasy football playoffs? Hall hadn’t rushed for more than 50 yards since early October and was limited to 18 yards from scrimmage in last week’s 30-0 loss to the Dolphins. The former Iowa State star had a career day against Washington’s porous defense, rushing for 95 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries. He also had a career-high 12 catches for 96 yards on 16 targets as the favorite outlet valve for Jets quarterback Trevor Siemian — who, as CBS analyst and former Washington free agent bust Adam Archuleta mentioned several times on the broadcast, failed to complete a pass of at least 10 air yards. BREECE HALL SHOWING UP IN THE FANTASY SEMIFINALS Down 27-7 at halftime against the league’s worst offense and New York’s fourth quarterback of the season, the Commanders appeared headed for their most embarrassing loss in years. Instead, Ron Rivera’s defense forced a punt or a turnover on the Jets’ first six possessions of the second half as Brissett and the offense mounted a comeback. “It’s about being a professional, and that’s what these young men showed — that they are professionals,”  . “They’re not going to quit, they’re not going to roll over, they’re not going to die. I couldn’t be more proud of the group … that came out, especially in the second half, and fought and played and gave it everything they had. They have pride. They have grit.” The Commanders and Jets combined for 22 penalties, 41 incompletions and several injury timeouts, all of which contributed to a slog of a game.

"LAS VEGAS — Logan Thompson made 32 saves, bouncing back from a shaky performance, and the Vegas Golden Knights stopped a four-game slide by holding off the Los Angeles Kings for a 3-2 victory Thursday night.

LAS VEGAS — Logan Thompson made 32 saves, bouncing back from a shaky performance, and the Vegas Golden Knights stopped a four-game slide by holding off the Los Angeles Kings for a 3-2 victory Thursday night. Jack Eichel, Michael Amadio and William Karlsson scored for Vegas — all in the first two periods. The Golden Knights had dropped five of six overall. “It’s our culture to be winning in this building,” Knights forward Paul Cotter said. “I think this is the start, hopefully, of a nice little streak going here.” Los Angeles had won four of five. Anze Kopitar had a goal and an assist for the Kings, and Trevor Moore also scored. Cam Talbot made 29 saves. Thompson surrendered four goals on Anaheim’s first nine shots during a   at the Ducks on Wednesday night, but then stopped 14 of the next 15. He carried that play into the matchup with the Kings. Coach Bruce Cassidy was critical of his goalies after the loss to Anaheim. That position has been hit hard by injuries for the second season in a row. Adin Hill, who is 10-2-2 with a 1.93 goals-against average, hasn’t played since Nov. 30 because of a lower-body injury. Thompson, an All-Star as a rookie last season, has been in and out of the lineup with injuries. “I think mentally this was the toughest month of my career,” Thompson said. “Just taking a step back and being grateful I’m in the NHL. I don’t know how long I’m going to be in the NHL and how long I’ll be a Vegas Golden Knight, but I come to the rink every day with a smile on my face.” Thompson said he wanted to return to the crease right after the loss to the Ducks. “I need to be better,” he said. “I expect a lot more out of me.” He got help from his teammates, who blocked a season-high 34 shots. “Our guys will play hard for whoever’s in there,” Cassidy said. “We’re going to do our part there. We just want the goaltender, not to win us games, we just don’t want them to lose games.” It was just the second regulation road loss for the Kings, who are 13-2-1 away from home. Knights defenseman Ben Hutton didn’t play the final two periods because of an upper-body injury. With chances at a premium during a defensive first period, Eichel took advantage of a small opening. Ivan Barbashev delivered a cross-ice pass to Eichel, who beat Talbot high from the left circle. Eichel has 40 points in 37 games. Vegas twice extended that lead to two goals in the second period. Amadio scored off a rush after receiving a pass from Pavel Dorofeyev, and Karlsson scored his 15th goal from the slot on a pass from Cotter from behind the goal line. Cotter has four points in his past four games and eight for December. He had seven in the first two months. “I think the disappointing part for me is the type of goals we gave up,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “A couple of them were gifts. I really thought the second goal killed us.” Kopitar got his 14th goal at 13:07, with Adrian Kempe recording his 20th assist on the play. Kopitar has 32 points in 32 games, and Kempe has 31. LA’s Kevin Fiala scored midway through the third period on a blast from the left point, but the goal was wiped out because of goaltender interference by Moore. Moore made up for it by scoring on a 6-on-5 with 1:59 remaining. It was his 17th of the season. “I thought as the game wore on, we got more connected,” McLellan said. “When they have the lead, they’re going to defend a little bit more. We spent more time in their zone. They did an outstanding job of blocking shots and clearing the net, which they’re very good at.” UP NEXT Kings: Host Edmonton on Saturday.

"The Texas Rangers on Wednesday did not end Major League Baseball’s longest World Series drought. That belongs to the Cleveland Guardians, who have not won the World Series since 1948. But the Rangers still ended decades of misery by winning the first World Series title in franchise history, which began in 1961 when the team was born as  . The Texas Rangers on Wednesday did not end Major League Baseball’s longest World Series drought. That belongs to the Cleveland Guardians, who have not won the World Series since 1948. But the Rangers still ended decades of misery by winning the first World Series title in franchise history, which began in 1961 when the team was born as  . This got us to thinking about other sad-sack teams that have been around awhile. Here, then, is the list of franchises that have been around the longest without winning a championship. For our purposes, we’re excluding long-existing teams such as the NFL’s Arizona Cardinals or Detroit Lions, who have never won a Super Bowl but won NFL championships before the Super Bowl was created. Likewise, the Buffalo Bills, Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers and Tennessee Titans/Houston Oilers won AFL championships before the AFL-NFL merger. In the NBA, the Brooklyn Nets and Indiana Pacers won ABA titles before joining the NBA. The Vikings have won 54.2 percent of their games over their history. They have made the playoffs 29 times since the NFL and AFL merged to become one league in 1970, third-most behind the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers. They’ve been to the NFC championship game nine times and the Super Bowl four times. They’re one of only seven NFL teams to win 15 games in one regular season. And yes, technically they have won an NFL championship, in 1969. But Minnesota went on to lose to the AFL’s Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl IV. That season did not end in champagne showers. Most NFL teams should be envious of the Vikings’ sustained success, yet most are probably glad not to have lived through Minnesota’s perennial winters of discontent.  In 1998, the Vikings went 15-1 during the regular season and averaged 34.8 points per game, the most by an NFL team in 48 years. After clobbering the Cardinals in the division round, Minnesota was an 11-point favorite to beat the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC championship game. But given the chance to take what likely would have been an insurmountable 10-point lead late in the fourth quarter, Gary Anderson’s 38-yard field goal attempt went wide left. It was his only missed kick of the season out of 107 field goal and extra-point attempts, and the Falcons would follow with a late touchdown to force overtime, where they won it on a field goal of their own. The expansion Suns were a winning franchise by their third season of existence and scored   in just their eighth, but they’ve returned there only twice since as they’ve cycled through periods of boom (in the 22 seasons between 1988 and 2010, they made the playoffs 19 times) and bust (their 10-season playoff drought that followed that run). Phoenix’s .536 all-time winning percentage  , and only the Utah Jazz has a better winning percentage among teams that have never won an NBA title.  The 1975-76 Suns finished the regular season only two games above .500 but defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in six games and then upset the Golden State Warriors — who had won an NBA-best 59 regular season games — to advance to face the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. The series was tied at two games apiece when the teams returned to Boston for Game 5,   that featured perhaps the most absurd 19-second span in NBA history. The Celtics won, 128-126, and would finish off the series two days later in Phoenix. The Suns wouldn’t return to the finals for another 17 years. The Padres and the Brewers (then known as the Seattle Pilots) were two of four MLB expansion teams in 1969. The other two (the Kansas City Royals and the Montreal Expos, who became the Washington Nationals) have won World Series titles. San Diego and Milwaukee have not. Both San Diego and Milwaukee have had their chances of late. The Padres advanced to the National League Championship Series in 2022 before losing in five games to the Philadelphia Phillies, then had the third-highest payroll in baseball this past season before flaming out and missing the postseason entirely (it’s since come out that the small-market franchise needed to take out   to cover expenses, including player payroll). The Brewers have made the postseason in five of the past six seasons but have won only one playoff series over that span, in 2018.  Of the teams’ combined three World Series appearances, the Brewers’ 1982 loss to the Cardinals was the closest either have gotten to glory (the Padres have won only one out of nine World Series games against two of the best teams of all time, the 1984 Detroit Tigers and 1998 New York Yankees). After eking into an AL East crown with a win over the Baltimore Orioles on the final day of the regular season, the Brewers won the deciding Game 5 of the American League Championship Series in dramatic fashion, overcoming a 3-2 deficit to the California Angles in the seventh inning. They then pounded the St. Louis Cardinals, 10-0, in Game 1 of the World Series and had a chance to wrap up the championship in Game 6. But the Cardinals won in a 13-1 rout, then closed out the series the next night in a 6-3 win. Though the Sabres and Canucks don’t have the dubious honor of having the longest Stanley Cup drought —   — they’re the two NHL teams that have been around the longest without ever winning it all. Though the franchises have combined to reach the Stanley Cup finals five times, neither has been much of a factor in recent years. The Sabres have not made the playoffs since 2011 and have not won a playoff series since 2007. Since their loss in the 2011 Stanley Cup finals, the Canucks have missed the playoffs in 9 of 13 seasons, and their only two series wins came in the 2020 pandemic playoffs.  Two of Vancouver’s three Stanley Cup finals appearances went to seven games, so it’s tough to pick one of them. I’ll go with the 1993-94 team that overcame a 3-1 series deficit to Calgary in the first round and then scored consecutive five-game series wins over the Stars and Maple Leafs before facing the New York Rangers — a team looking to end   — in the Stanley Cup finals. Once again, Vancouver faced a 3-1 deficit, and once again, the Canucks came back, winning Games 5 and 6 by a combined 10-4. But the Rangers jumped out to leads of 2-0 and 3-1 in the deciding Game 7 and held on over a tense final period to win their first Stanley Cup since 1940. Of the 10 teams to take part in Major League Soccer’s inaugural 1996 season, four have never won the MLS Cup. One of them (the Tampa Bay Mutiny) folded before the 2002 season. The three listed above still are looking for their first championship. Between 2002 and 2010, either FC Dallas, New England or New York appeared in the MLS Cup final six times. None of them won, and only the Revolution has been back since (in 2014).  In 2006, the Revolution appeared in its second of three straight MLS Cup finals. After a scoreless 90 minutes against the Houston Dynamo, the two teams traded goals about a minute apart in extra time, with Taylor Twellman scoring for New England and Brian Ching scoring for Houston. In the penalty shootout that followed, Dynamo goalkeeper Pat Onstad smothered Revolution defender Jay Heaps’s attempt in the fifth round to give Houston its first MLS Cup and extend New England’s misery. The Liberty is the only one of the WNBA’s existing original franchises without a championship, though it’s not for a lack of trying: New York has lost in the WNBA finals five times, including this season’s   in their first appearance in 21 years. The Liberty reached the finals in four of its first six years of existence but came up short each time. It’s only missed the playoffs nine times in the WNBA’s 27-season existence.  Game 2 of the 1999 WNBA finals between the Liberty and the Houston Comets featured one of the more memorable shots in league history, when New York’s Teresa Weatherspoon banked in a half-court buzzer-beater amid prematurely falling confetti in Houston to give the Liberty a 68-67 win and force a Game 3. Houston dominated the deciding game and won by 12, however.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/02/texas-rangers-off-no-championship-list/,Washington Post,2023-11-02 12:51:00,
"On the night before Christmas, guess what? No one in Florida was stirring after all. Not even the Florida House. The 13-0 ACC champion Florida State football team on Sunday clambered down air stairs from its plane that landed in Fort Lauderdale, not terribly far from its campus in Tallahassee, to prepare for Saturday’s Orange Bowl against Georgia. On the night before Christmas, guess what? No one in Florida was stirring after all. Not even the Florida House. The 13-0 ACC champion Florida State football team on Sunday clambered down air stairs from its plane that landed in Fort Lauderdale, not terribly far from its campus in Tallahassee, to prepare for Saturday’s Orange Bowl against Georgia. There was no boycott, no protest and, most mercifully, no phalanx of politicians and lawmakers accompanying the team to make grandiose statements about having been wronged. As well there shouldn’t have been. Just because the College Football Playoff made Florida State the first unbeaten Power Five conference champion   doesn’t mean that skulduggery took place, that this system to decide the best college football team was rigged, that Michigan, Washington, Texas and Alabama weren’t the legitimate four teams to play in the national championship tournament. This is no more ground for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Florida Sen. Rick Scott (R) to sow denial about the properness of the process than was the 2020 presidential election, the results of which they didn’t like and became part of sullying. The possibility of something untoward, however, was the specious argument amplified by DeSantis and Scott in particular in the immediate wake of Florida State’s being left out. DeSantis   that he was going to free up $1 million from the state budget to sue the College Football Playoff committee. Scott   angry missives to CFP executive director Bill Hancock that echoed the script of presidential election deniers. “Those who feel snubbed or mistreated should not be denied the opportunity to get an explanation for the decisions that created that perception,” Scott  . Scott claimed it wasn’t just Florida State fans who felt that way but “Americans across the country who doubt the integrity of the playoff system.” (Whatever happened to Republicans being able to lose graciously?) The shame in all of this is that it unnecessarily discredits the time-honored tradition of winning and losing — or in this case, losing out — that sports seems to have adjudicated for a long time. The final score is the final score. The standings are the standings. How we lose, or accept it, means something. “Sport’s glory, I want to suggest, resides in the way the proper spirit of the game gives flesh to the fairness required by its rules — in the tension between the quest for and love of victory and the acceptance of the reality, the objectivity, of vulnerability to defeat that is bound up with the very idea of a sporting encounter, and distinguishes it from a brawl subject to surveillance,” Australian philosophy scholar Tony Skillen wrote in   “Sport is for Losers.” “The good sport, then, has learned both to ‘go for it’, and to ‘take it’, and these intertwined lessons constitute among the deepest we can expect to be taught.” Skillen would do us well to counsel the playoff deniers. Was there some subjectivity employed in picking which college football teams would play next month for the national crown? Absolutely. Was there before, and will there be next year when the tournament expands to include a dozen teams? Of course. That doesn’t mean the process needs legal or political intervention. What DeSantis and Scott decided they should spend taxpayers’ money on is not a novel nonsense effort. After the Los Angeles Rams beat the New Orleans Saints in   in January 2019, a couple of Saints season ticket holders sued NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL for mental anguish, emotional trauma and other such damages. The suit was rooted in the belief that the Rams won in overtime only because the officials missed a pass interference call late in the fourth quarter. The lawsuit eventually  . That it got so far was a waste of time and labor. After Utah’s undefeated 2008 team was snubbed by what was then college football’s arranged marriage championship system called the Bowl Championship Series, Utah Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R) pressed President Barack Obama to have the Justice Department investigate how Utah could suffer such an egregious ruling. Hatch at one point told his Senate colleagues, “The BCS system is anti-competitive, unfair and, in my opinion, un-American.” Justice left the game to the coaches, players and college football governors. Remember Deflategate? Some New England Patriots fans sued the NFL over their favorite team being   in the 2016 NFL draft. It was part of the punishment after the league determined quarterback Tom Brady was in cahoots in a scheme to use deflated footballs for a better grip.

He has cooled now. “The guys are excited for the opportunity to compete — and that’s what we have, doing it against a great opponent,” Norvell said upon deplaning. “... Ultimately, that’s what we have in front of us.” As it should be.

Toward the beginning of the fourth quarter, Scottie Barnes used his long limbs to poke the ball away from Washington Wizards guard Landry Shamet near the top of the key, then turned to tear downcourt, bounding all the way. The Toronto Raptors forward didn’t just score off yet another turnover Wednesday night; he turned the giveaway into a spectacle, sending the ball high in the air to Jalen McDaniels for a flamboyant dunk. By that point, Barnes had every reason to feel nice and comfortable as the Raptors continued cruising to a 132-102 win at Capital One Arena. The Wizards hardly provided any resistance all night as they allowed their opponent to score at least 130 points for the 14th time in 30 games. Their defense was essentially nonexistent: The Raptors (12-18) shot 57.1 percent as they strolled through the paint with seemingly little thought from Washington. The visitors had 43 assists on 52 baskets and assisted on all 15 of their three-pointers. The Raptors also beat the Wizards (5-25) at the game’s uglier elements: Toronto had 20 turnovers to the Wizards’ 17 but managed to eke out more points off giveaways (25 to 21). “It’s a strength of that team, so we knew that ball security and valuing possession would be key,” said Coach Wes Unseld Jr., whose Wizards have lost three in a row. “Obviously you don’t want to turn the ball over, but when you do, you’ve got to find a way to show a little more resilience to those turnovers, and oftentimes they got behind us. Those turned into layups and dunks.” OG Anunoby, the Raptors’ third-leading scorer, was crafty as he used the roughly three inches and 40 pounds he had on his primary defender, Jordan Poole. He led all scorers with 26 points on 11-for-16 shooting. Pascal Siakam added 22 points and 11 assists, and Barnes had 20 points and 12 rebounds. “They just exploited mismatches. They’re a big team; they’re smart,” the Wizards’ Kyle Kuzma said. “They understand their team — when they see a mismatch on the court, they try to hunt it and attack it every time.” The Wizards’ offense was balanced — seven scorers in double figures, all between 10 and 14 points — but not one player made much of an impact on  . Poole and Kuzma had 14 points apiece, and no one reached double figures in rebounds as Toronto shoved Washington aside on the boards 53-34. Here’s what else to know about the Wizards’ loss: Asked about the Wizards’ rebounding deficit, Unseld reiterated that his team needs to prioritize getting on the boards. Washington has few defense-first players and has struggled in that area all season. “Some of it is we’re undersized a little bit, but I think it’s just a mind-set as well. We can’t afford to ball-watch, and I think at times we do,” Unseld said. “… [Rebounding] is something that we harp on, and there’s no schematics to boxing out. There’s individual technique, of course; you can do box-out drills and things like that, but there’s just got to be more of a shift in mind-set that this is a priority.” Forward Danilo Gallinari played on the second night of a back-to-back for the first time in his return from ACL surgery in September 2022. While his left knee held up, his back did not — the 35-year-old subbed out early in the second quarter and never returned because of lower-back spasms. He had one rebound in five minutes. Delon Wright, who was on the court during Tuesday’s loss to Orlando for the first time since Nov. 10 because of a knee sprain, was sidelined for rest purposes as he gradually increases his activity. Kuzma was listed as questionable because of a right quad contusion he suffered last week at Portland but managed to play anyway, keeping alive his streak of perfect availability.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/27/wizards-raptors-defense-blowout/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 23:26:00,
"Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) escalated his call to rein in state spending this week, telling a convention of local government leaders the “hard truth” is the state has to pick some priorities at the expense of others. In a speech laced with warnings, Moore told members of the Maryland Association of Counties that, “At a time when Marylanders are feeling squeezed and skeptical, we need to do more than tighten our belts. We must rethink how state government actually does business.” They responded with applause. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) escalated his call to rein in state spending this week, telling a convention of local government leaders the “hard truth” is the state has to pick some priorities at the expense of others. In a speech laced with warnings, Moore told members of the Maryland Association of Counties that, “At a time when Marylanders are feeling squeezed and skeptical, we need to do more than tighten our belts. We must rethink how state government actually does business.” They responded with applause. Thursday night’s speech represented the first-term governor’s latest public move taming   that accompanied him into office last year, when he sailed to victory on pledges to end childhood poverty, bridge the racial wealth gap and hasten the transition to 100 percent clean energy. He continued to press a message  : Maryland’s ambition will be constrained by its economic weaknesses and a sprawling budget that faces regular shortfalls because the state “spread ourselves too thin.” The state faces an estimated $400 million budget hole next year that legislative analysts project will to balloon to about $1.8 billion annually in five years — driven by a long-standing mismatch between tax revenue and ambitious policy goals. Maryland’s revenue is expected to rise 3.3 percent annually while spending is set to grow by 5.1 percent,   by the Maryland Department of Legislative Services. A similar dynamic has played out ahead of 17 of the past 20 budget cycles, Moore noted, with politicians pushing for policy wins passing legislation without putting money behind their plans. As Moore put it Thursday, “We put everything inside of budgets without a plan on how to pay for it, and the budget gap is the result.” He added, “The hard thing means actually fixing a system that’s broken, so that we can lead and not simply sustain.” He defended an early round of proposed and controversial spending cuts unveiled this week that would eliminate $3.3 billion of planned transportation projects over the next six years. He did not identify other priorities he would eliminate. “Papering over the problems — kicking the can down the road — simply asking people to pay more for things that they don’t feel are working that’s not hard,” Moore said. In his speech, Moore asked the local officials for their “trust” in navigating the cuts ahead, saying “trust demands transparency and trust demands truth, even if it’s hard. This evening, I offer both — both to you and to the people of this state.” “In this challenging time, we have a duty to act with discipline. Because discipline is what the people of this state deserve,” he said. While saying directly “I don’t have all the answers right now, and I’m honest about that,” Moore also outlined some of the programs he planned to push during his second year. He said he would unveil a package of housing bills next week, a handful of roughly a dozen he would push in the General Assembly session that begins in Maryland. He said he wanted to make Maryland the best place for businesses to invest in data centers and broadly to address the current workforce shortage in law enforcement. He said he would continue his campaign promise to address child poverty, promising an “all-out assault.” He said he would seek an “all-of-the-above” approach to public safety, which he broadly described to include reducing recidivism, support for law enforcement, enhanced coordination and statewide job training programs. Moore said the pandemic era federal aid and roaring stock market swelled states’ balance sheets nationwide — and in Maryland produced record surpluses. But ultimately it amounted to a “mirage” that disguised Maryland’s systemic problems. The largest mismatch between the spending plans on the books and the money to pay for them comes from an education overhaul called the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. It aims to boost achievement statewide, train students for careers outside of college and use the education system to alleviate some impacts of poverty, among other goals. It’s projected to cost $4 billion annually when fully implemented, which is several years away. Moore’s Republican predecessor, Larry Hogan, also harped on that mismatch during his two terms, blaming Democratic state lawmakers for passing laws that called for unsustainable future spending but making year-by-year solutions. Moore suggested he wanted a more wholesale overhaul, something he would need the Democratic supermajority in Annapolis to enact. “We’re forced to reckon with structural challenges that have plagued our state for years,” he said. “This administration is going to refuse to ignore it, and we refuse to push policies that will only make it worse, and something worse off to our successors.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/09/wes-moore-maryland-speech-trust/,Washington Post,2023-12-09 06:00:00,

American soccer’s governing body rejected MLS’s effort to send developmental squads to the  , the 110-year-old tournament involving all levels of the sport. The U.S. Soccer Federation’s decision Wednesday is an embarrassment to MLS, which caused a stir in the soccer community last week when it announced its  in the competition in 2024. The league cited a congested calendar, which includes a four-week tournament it co-created with Mexico’s top division, and the desire to provide greater competitive opportunities for young players. “After thoughtful consideration, we have informed MLS that the U.S. Soccer staff recommendation, which was adopted by the Pro League Taskforce, is that the request be denied,” the USSF said in a statement. “As we move forward, we will continue our review of the Open Cup to ensure it aligns with the U.S. Soccer strategic pillars. We remain committed to addressing the needs and concerns of all of our members, including MLS, and other stakeholders to enhance and improve the U.S. Open Cup.” The USSF did not provide reasons for rejecting MLS’s request. In a statement, MLS said it planned to send secondary squads because it “believes that there are several essential goals and concerns that must be addressed in connection with the tournament.” “MLS is committed to finding a viable solution for the 2024 tournament and is working to find a pathway that addresses its goals and concerns,” the league added. It is unclear if a solution is possible this year. MLS on Wednesday   its regular season schedule, which includes several midweek matches (when Open Cup games are played) and a late-summer gap for the Leagues Cup, the tournament pitting all 47 MLS and Liga MX clubs. The calendar is so crowded that MLS will again defy global protocol and schedule games during international windows, when players are away representing their countries. MLS could find itself in trouble with USSF governance, which sanctions pro leagues for first-, second- and third-division status. The federation’s pro league standards state that “U.S.-based teams must participate in all representative U.S. Soccer and Concacaf [regional] competitions for which they are eligible.” The Open Cup brings together the three pro divisions, plus amateur sides, for a single-elimination tournament running concurrently with their regular seasons. It is modeled after the English FA Cup and other national cup competitions throughout Europe. Since its founding in 1996, MLS has entered teams at or near the round of 32. Some teams take it less seriously than others, mixing regulars, reserves and young prospects. The tournament, however, has suffered from financial burdens on teams, substandard playing conditions at some lower-tier venues and a lack of visibility. The USSF controls broadcast rights and arranges live streams on various platforms; no games appear on MLS’s primary partner, Apple TV Plus, which is entering the second year of a 10-year, $2.5 billion deal with the league. MLS Commissioner Don Garber complained openly about the Open Cup last May. And last week, as a deadline for tournament entry approached, the league announced its plans to send teams from MLS Next Pro, a third-division circuit featuring developmental squads owned by MLS organizations. Every U.S.-based MLS team fields a team in Next Pro except D.C. United, which plans to launch a program in Baltimore in coming years. In recent months, MLS said it had discussed its Open Cup intentions with the USSF. “At no time did U.S. Soccer raise an objection to Next Pro’s participation,” said a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. In regards to the perception MLS is thumbing its nose at a traditional competition, that person added: “We respect the tournament history. … But what we bristle at is the tournament feels stuck. … We believe there needs to be more than a recognition that it needs to evolve.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/20/us-soccer-open-cup-mls-teams/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 12:36:00,

It’s quite possible that Trump ultimately will appear on the ballot, for a  , but the ruling remains a historic step with potential real consequences for the body politic. Americans in general and even (largely silent) Democratic lawmakers seem unsure about disqualification. Although a majority of Americans said after the  , 2021, attack on the Capitol that Congress should convict and disqualify Trump at his impeachment trial, the most recent polling shows   saying that his alleged election subversion — if it is proved — should disqualify him.  The poll didn’t ask whether   should make that decision. “Let the voters decide” is an easy argument to make. But there’s another way to look at this. And that’s that Trump is yet again suffering under a standard he himself attempted to set for America’s political system. Trump on Tuesday night derided the ruling as “eliminating the rights of Colorado voters to vote for the candidate of their choice.” But not only did Trump try to overturn the will of voters after the 2020 election, he has on myriad occasions pushed the idea that candidates should be disqualified irrespective of the voters’ will. That was basically the thrust of Trump’s rise to political prominence. He built a base in the early 2010s with the ugly and false “birther” campaign, whose entire premise was that Barack Obama wasn’t eligible to be president. A sampling: Trump didn’t stop there. During the 2016 GOP primary campaign, he repeatedly pushed the idea that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) might — and even should — be disqualified, both because he was   and because he purportedly cheated in the Iowa caucuses, which Cruz won. And Trump explicitly called for two others to be prohibited from running, including Hillary Clinton — a lot: Needless to say, there is more than a vein of irony in Trump’s having said that promoting false information about an election should lead the authorities to disqualify someone. And Trump has repeatedly pushed the idea that a candidate’s eligibility for president shouldn’t be left up to voters. The candidate who a court now says is constitutionally ineligible to serve as president once showed great interest in having people he disagreed with disqualified under the Constitution’s standards. This isn’t necessarily a good-for-the-gander situation. But it’s worth emphasizing that Trump’s supposedly principled response is undermined by his past words. And if it sounds familiar, it should. After all, long before Trump derided the idea that a   and former president like him could be indicted, he called for the  . If the whole 14th Amendment exercise is the political farce that Trump says it is, he certainly played a role in writing the script.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/20/trump-refrain-disqualification-thee-not-me/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 12:32:00,

According to multiple reports Monday, he and his new team agreed to a novel structure that defers an unfathomable $680 million of the contract until the end of his 10-year pact. So for accounting purposes, Ohtani’s decision to take just a $2 million salary from his guaranteed fortune for the next 10 years allows the Dodgers to manipulate their payroll and decrease their potential luxury tax bill as they attempt to make additions to fortify an already championship-caliber roster. The tactic is legal, amazingly. While deferred money is common in large MLB contracts, no one imagined the need to safeguard against the most coveted player ever choosing to postpone payment of 97 percent of his record-setting deal. Ohtani ignored the diminishing value of that $680 million over such a long time, and he trusts that nothing catastrophic will happen to the Dodgers or MLB in the future. After the Los Angeles Angels failed to make the playoffs in his first six big league seasons, Ohtani doesn’t just want to win with the Dodgers. He opted to equip them with the flexibility to dominate. The two-way superstar signed a two-way contract. How Ohtani of him. During the long and quiet wait for him to make up his mind, the speculation portrayed him as some kind of counterculture sports figure who might value something besides his maximum value. , in the months before free agency and in the pensive weeks he spent as perhaps the greatest athlete to hit the open market. And people shouted the darnedest things into the void. Many wondered whether his West Coast preference would limit his options and subdue the bidding war. Or maybe  , which will prevent him from pitching next season, would change the structure or reduce the number of years on his contract. Then there was the most naive take of all: It was deemed plausible that Ohtani, who is Japanese, might restrain his demands because it would be the honorable thing for him to do — a belief that must have been conceived by a “Karate Kid Part II” zealot. It was such cozy, convenient fiction. Then, amid heavy anticipation that Ohtani would defy convention, he still stunned the world. He got his, and he did it his way. He redefined Sho-Time, making the most of his moment, reaching agreement on a 10-year, $700 million deal that will forever look like a typo before reportedly coming up with the idea to divide the money like no one ever will again. I’m assuming it will not be allowed to happen again. Ohtani and the Dodgers invented some next-level competitive balance tax evasion. Ohtani is too humble and likable to be a villain (unless you’re one of those Angels crazies burning his No. 17 jersey). But hatred — or envy — of the Dodgers just rose to a preposterous level. The Dodgers still have wiggle room to pursue a major starting pitching upgrade to address their biggest concerns, which Ohtani can’t help with in 2024. Those aspirations include Yoshinobu Yamamoto, considered the next Japanese pitching prodigy, even though he might command a contract of more than $200 million. Ohtani isn’t just a once-in-a-lifetime player. Sometimes it seems as if he is from another dimension. In a sport that struggles to create must-see moments,  . Now that he plays for the Dodgers — a perennial contender, model franchise and premier brand in the nation’s second-largest market — he will pause time more often. The Dodgers didn’t acquire him simply to improve their chances of winning another World Series. With the vast financial resources of their ownership group, they could have improved their team a number of different ways. But they had to have Ohtani because, despite what they’re paying him, it’s a wise investment to add a little Sho-Time to the way they operate. With advanced statistics, you can measure how much the Dodgers enhanced their World Series potential, but we’re just beginning to fathom how much their entertainment value has multiplied. For six seasons, Ohtani had to shine through mediocrity to make people pay attention. He gets to do so now with the stage already set. He would look good in any uniform, but in Dodger blue, an icon will be cloaked in the iconic. Ohtani’s deal is nearly $275 million more than   former teammate Mike Trout signed in 2019. But the Ohtani contract doesn’t mean the next free agent baseball superstar can gin up some deferred money concepts and ask for $70 million a season. He’s an extreme outlier in a game currently paying mortal, single-position superstars between $30 million and $40 million a year when they enter free agency. Pitchers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander are the only other players with contracts averaging more than $40 million. Both are at $43.3 million, but the future Hall of Famers signed short-term deals last winter with the New York Mets, who promptly  . It led the Mets to get off those contracts by the trade deadline. In baseball, $40 million is the non-Ohtani standard for average annual salary, which is where New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge — working on   that he signed after   — resides alone. With a strong season,  , who is still just 25, might get offered in the neighborhood of $40 million annually next winter, and his total pact could exceed $500 million because New York and other suitors might be willing to offer him 12 to 15 years of security. But Soto could sign for $550 million and still lag behind Ohtani. The regularity of even a $50 million-a-year baseball superstar is still a ways away. Ohtani’s deal, especially with the creative math, won’t accelerate the timeline as much as you think. As Ohtani transitions from the faulty Angels to Southern California’s high-functioning baseball team, he doesn’t have to move to take a dramatic leap in competitiveness. Still, the entire sports world feels the ground shaking. In the end, after all the mystery surrounding how he would handle this situation, he did do something different. He took all the money, found the best team for him and somehow did it without seeming selfish and greedy. When it comes to athlete power moves, Ohtani wrote his own cheat code and hid it in a secret location. To be worthy of finding it, the next superstar might have to play three positions and walk on water.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/12/shohei-ohtani-contract/,Washington Post,2023-12-12 06:05:00,

The report on the investigation’s findings outlined what happened in the days leading up to the shooting, which  outraged the Israeli public and intensified scrutiny of Israel’s military campaign. The United States has urged Israel to modify  its operations in the  , citing concerns over the extreme civilian death toll. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari on Thursday said the results of the investigation had been shared with the families of the hostages, Yotam Haim, Samer Al-Talalka and Alon Shamriz. On Dec. 10, IDF soldiers raided several buildings in Shejaiya, a neighborhood in eastern Gaza City that has seen fierce fighting (the IDF   it had gained operational control of Shejaiya). During the raid, IDF soldiers heard calls in Hebrew asking for help. They assessed that it was a trap by   militants who sought to deceive them, the IDF report said. Such methods had been used in the past, it added. On Dec. 14, the IDF said, signs reading “SOS” and “save three kidnapped people” were seen on a building that was about 650 feet from where the hostages were killed the next day. During “intense fighting” on Dec. 15, an IDF soldier fired at three “figures” whom he had identified as a threat. Two were killed while one ran away, according to the investigation results. The soldier who fired the first shots “stood in a position with limited vision” of the hostages, the IDF said. Commanders declared a cease-fire to try to identify the third person, who  called out for help minutes later. Another cease-fire was ordered and the person “came out of a structure toward the force,” the IDF said. But two soldiers who had not heard the order to hold their fire “due to noise from a nearby tank” shot and killed the third person. The hostages had emerged from the building shirtless and  , the IDF said. The Hamas militants who were holding the three men were killed in the raid on Dec. 10, the IDF said, citing analysis that included footage from a camera mounted on a dog that was sent into the building. The three hostages had apparently fled the building after the Dec. 10 raid, the IDF said, “on an escape mission.” “The Chief of Staff determined that the hits on the hostages could have been prevented,” the investigation results read. “Alongside this, the Chief of Staff clarified that there was no malice in the event, and the soldiers carried out the right action to the best of their understanding of the event at that moment.” Hagari on Thursday praised the three hostages for “trying to do everything in their power to signal to us that they were in the area,” saying: “We are responsible for what happened.” Noting that there are still 129 hostages in Gaza, he said the IDF has “the duty to draw lessons as quickly as possible.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/hostages-killed-idf-investigation/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 03:32:00,
"Julius W. Becton Jr., a three-star Army general who retired as one of the military’s highest-ranking Black officers, then led the nation’s disaster-relief agency and D.C. public schools, died Nov. 28 at a retirement home in Fairfax County. He was 97. The cause was complications from dementia, said his daughter Joyce Best. Julius W. Becton Jr., a three-star Army general who retired as one of the military’s highest-ranking Black officers, then led the nation’s disaster-relief agency and D.C. public schools, died Nov. 28 at a retirement home in Fairfax County. He was 97. The cause was complications from dementia, said his daughter Joyce Best. Raised in the Philadelphia suburbs, Gen. Becton was 17 when he volunteered for service in the still-segregated Army, viewing the military as a way out of poverty. He went on to become a decorated veteran of three wars, receiving the Silver Star in Korea and Vietnam and serving as the first Black officer to lead what was then the Army’s  , at Fort Dix in New Jersey. In 1978, he was appointed commander of the VII Corps in West Germany, becoming the first Black commander of an Army corps. “He served as a mentor to those who followed in his distinguished footsteps,” Colin Powell, the first Black chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later said. “I was one of them and would never have risen without his example and help.” After retiring from the Army as a lieutenant general in 1983, Gen. Becton led the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, supporting relief efforts for an earthquake that struck Mexico City and a famine that ravaged Ethiopia. He was tapped to head the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 1985, after his predecessor resigned amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement. Gen. Becton coordinated the federal response to disasters, including floods that swamped parts of the Mid-Atlantic just as he took office, and was credited with overhauling FEMA itself. “He brought a sense of integrity back to the agency,” said Jane Bullock, FEMA’s chief of staff, in a 1996 interview with  . “He gave people in the agency a sense of direction.” By many accounts, he oversaw a similar turnaround at his alma mater, Prairie View A&M University, a historically Black public school near Houston. He was appointed president in 1989, taking over at a time when the school was hurt by low morale and public mistrust, with crumbling dormitories, a rash of crime on campus and a financial crisis that led him to temporarily halt most athletic programs. Gen. Becton called in the Texas Rangers to investigate allegations of financial misconduct, leading to indictments against eight administrators, and he oversaw fundraising efforts that reportedly grew the endowment to $10 million from $4.8 million. But he frustrated some faculty and alumni who accused him of lacking a long-term vision, and who criticized him for dismantling a football program that went on a record-setting 80-game losing streak after play resumed. He had been retired for two years, living in Northern Virginia, when he   to lead D.C. public schools in November 1996. The city was in the midst of a financial crisis, with its politics and finances overseen by the federally mandated D.C. financial control board, and the school system was in disarray: Facilities were falling apart, test scores were dismal and administrators struggled to complete basic tasks, such as mailing paychecks to teachers. Gen. Becton said he took the superintendent’s job out of a sense of duty to the District’s approximately 80,000 students, including many who were from poor Black families like his own. His father was a janitor with a third-grade education, and his mother took in laundry and made it to the 10th grade. All five of his children had attended Washington public schools when he was stationed in the District. One of his sons provided crucial encouragement, Gen. Becton recalled, asking him: “How would you feel if five years from now you had a grandchild in the school system, and you had a chance to do something about it and you didn’t?” Gen. Becton took office answering only to the financial control board, which had fired his predecessor, diminished the authority of the elected school board and empowered the new superintendent to overhaul rules for hiring and firing the system’s employees. While insisting that a turnaround would take at least five years, Gen. Becton promised to put “children first” and championed a message of integrity, loyalty and chain of command. He fixed leaky roofs, introduced academic and administrative changes, and installed metal detectors to stop students smuggling in weapons. But he struggled to connect with parents and community leaders, including some who found him aloof and rigid. Critics questioned his decision to close nearly a dozen schools, and a systemwide repair effort caused schools to start three weeks late. He resigned after 17 months, on the heels of an unexpected $62 million budget shortfall that the system’s finance chief   insufficient funding for the number of employees the system was authorized to have. Anthony A. Williams, the city’s chief financial officer and future mayor, had also released a report concluding that Gen. Becton had failed to fix the school system’s “organizational culture of indifference and resistance.” Gen. Becton suggested that he was undermined from within, including by recalcitrant teachers and administrators who had little interest in carrying out his changes. But he also acknowledged that he had failed to reach perhaps his most important constituency. “If I had one silver bullet, it would be greater parental and community involvement,” he said at a news conference announcing his departure. “I did not go out to generate, to develop, as much community and parental involvement as I should have.” Trying to reform the District’s schools, he later said, “has been the toughest job that I’ve ever had.” Julius Wesley Becton Jr. was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., on June 29, 1926. He grew up attending public schools in Ardmore, where he starred on the football team at Lower Merion High School and volunteered for the Army in 1943 at age 17, starting active-duty military service after he graduated the next year. “In the ’40s, a Black man had three ways to become a financial success: He could preach, teach or practice medicine,” Gen. Becton told the New Jersey Record. “I couldn’t be happy staying in the same place, doing the same thing, so I became a soldier.” Gen. Becton had enlisted in the Army Air Forces, planning to become a pilot. But he failed an eye test and, after a sergeant suggested he apply for officer candidate school, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry. While stationed in the Pacific at the close of World War II, he found himself disillusioned by the military’s treatment of Black soldiers. He separated from the Army in 1946 and received a football scholarship to Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., where he was one of the school’s  . He returned to active duty in 1948, after President Harry S. Truman ordered the military to integrate. That same year, he married Louise Thornton, his high school sweetheart. She became a nurse and  . In addition to his daughter Joyce, of Alexandria, Va., survivors include four other children: Shirley McKenzie of Alexandria, Karen Johnson of Arlington, Tex., Renee Strickland of Centreville, Va., and Julius “Wes” Becton III of Elmhurst, Ill.; 11 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. Gen. Becton completed his college education at Prairie View A&M, receiving a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1960. He earned a master’s in economics from the University of Maryland in 1967, and five years later he was promoted to brigadier general, becoming one of only eight Black generals in the Army, according to a New York Times report. By then he had acquired a reputation as an expert battlefield tactician, receiving his first Silver Star after leading a charge up a hill in Korea. According to a  , he was struck and wounded but kept fighting, leading his platoon through a chaotic 10-hour firefight while they were separated from the rest of their battalion. Gen. Becton received his second Silver Star during the Tet Offensive of 1968, while commanding a cavalry squadron during heavy fighting at Sông Bé in Vietnam. His other decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal, two Legion of Merit honors and two Purple Hearts. When Gen. Becton left the Washington schools job, D.C. Council member Kevin P. Chavous, who led the education committee,   “a man of honor,” adding that he was “someone who wanted to do the right thing, but in many ways fell victim to the same bureaucracy that has hurt so many administrators.” Gen. Becton said he   — “physically, emotionally, mentally” — but insisted that he had left the system a better place than he had found it. Education, he never stopped telling reporters and students, was a ticket out of poverty, and nothing less than the future of Washington’s children was at stake when it came to improving the school district. “I have ridden in the back of that bus, and I have sat at that segregated lunch counter, and I have traveled many miles with my family looking to buy gas and to use the restroom … and I was taught that if we got that education, you can never lose it,” he said at a  . “Let me say that again: If we got that education, you can never lose it.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/11/29/julius-becton-general-dead/,Washington Post,2023-11-29 16:05:00,

She is writing a diary series for The Washington Post throughout the season to document the life of a high school player. This is her second entry. There’s a running joke on TikTok and YouTube where creators ask strangers a question: Would you rather have a dollar or tickets to a WNBA game? Most respondents say, “A dollar.” It’s absurd but sadly not surprising. This undervaluation of female athletes seeps into high school sports. It’s no secret the varsity boys’ basketball team gets more hype than us. Last year, during its senior night, the parking lot was so jam-packed that parents had to park their cars in neighboring streets and walk to the gym. I’m not one to be jealous that their away games often draw more Richard Montgomery fans than our home games. Why should I, when the number of fans sitting in the stands is out of my control? Abby Meyers, a pro basketball player, came to one of our practices in June. When I spoke with her about the disparity of interest in men’s and women’s sports, she said: “In situations you can’t control, your only choice is to be okay and keep going. … I’m going to play this game no matter what, and whoever wants to come can come. If they don’t, they could miss something really cool.” What did annoy me, though, was one particular morning when RMBC (our school’s morning broadcast) came on. After a few ads from clubs and the all-important cafeteria lunch menu announcement, the broadcast played a flashy highlight reel of the boys’ team in action. As the video concluded, the announcer encouraged our student population to come out that night and support the team. Then, as if it was an afterthought, they said, “The girls also have a game.” ? My ears perked up, and I remember exchanging incredulous glances with my teammate and teacher, who had raised her eyebrows. That four-letter word sent our team’s group chat into a rage. Essentially, what those morning announcements had communicated to us and the rest of the school was that while the boys were worth a lovely three-minute reel, we weren’t even worth three seconds of airtime. It was like hearing those strangers say women’s basketball players aren’t worth a dollar — except these weren’t random strangers on the internet but our very own classmates. I’m not discouraged by having a smaller viewership. Our team puts in the hard work every afternoon because the game matters to us. We play for ourselves, and we’re endlessly grateful when our friends, families, teachers and amazing cheerleading team show up to support us. But when we’re consistently sidelined in the morning announcements and our   appears biased toward the boys’ games with the photos posted and captions written, we have a problem. When our captain last year commented, “The girls have a game too!” on an Instagram post exclusively dedicated to the boys, another account replied, “We do not care.” Girls deserve equal coverage and enthusiasm from their student associations and the individuals entrusted with keeping the school informed about sporting events. By focusing solely on the boys’ games, there’s an implicit message sent that our games aren’t as important or exciting or that we don’t work as hard — none of which are true. We have made these points known, and we’re cautiously optimistic amends will be made this season. Although it’s still too early to tell, things look hopeful. Our school newspaper, the Tide, is consistent with its coverage of all sports teams.  , an Instagram hub for RM sports affiliated with  , was created this year. It has been unbiased in the players featured for live interviews and has posted sports scores for boys’ and girls’ teams. The morning announcements I have heard congratulate both teams on their victories. While I feel more disappointment than discouragement when we go unrecognized, I do feel encouraged by recognition. We’re not asking for anything big. Even a quick shout-out in the announcements makes a difference — classmates will turn and look at you to say “Good luck!” or “Great win last night!” These moments may seem minor, but to the team, it’s a boost of morale. For JV players who look up to the varsity team, the recognition shows that our girls’ basketball program is valued, encouraging them to keep pursuing their athletic potential. A transformation in the way women’s sports are celebrated is much needed, and high school sports are a good place to start.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/24/basketball-diaries-we-dont-need-clout-spare-girls-disrespect/,Washington Post,2023-12-24 12:15:00,
"Every year, the Military Bowl works with the Pentagon and local military bases to arrange a flyover as part of the pregame pomp and circumstance at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The flyover before Wednesday’s kickoff between Tulane and Virginia Tech in Annapolis will feature two F-18 Super Hornets and a pair of pilots with connections to each other and the teams on the field. Every year, the Military Bowl works with the Pentagon and local military bases to arrange a flyover as part of the pregame pomp and circumstance at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The flyover before Wednesday’s kickoff between Tulane and Virginia Tech in Annapolis will feature two F-18 Super Hornets and a pair of pilots with connections to each other and the teams on the field. One of the fighter jets will be piloted by Cmdr. Adam Stephens, a Tulane graduate and the commanding officer of VFC-12, a reserve adversary squadron based at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach. The other will be flown by Stephens’s executive officer, Cmdr. Elliott Shoup, who graduated from Virginia Tech. “When the bowl selections came out and they announced the pairings, Elliott and I said, ‘Hey, this is awesome; we got to do it,’ ” Stephens said in a phone interview. “There’s not a ton of alumni in naval aviation for these two teams.” “We thought the Virginia Tech-Tulane alumni thing was reasonably compelling and probably kind of rare,” Shoup said. Military Bowl officials agreed and selected the duo to perform the flyover after Stephens initially expressed interest in the role to one of his contacts in the Tulane athletic department. Stephens, who grew up in Baton Rouge, developed an early interest in fighter jets. “I saw ‘Top Gun’ at a young age and decided that was what I wanted to do,” he said. After graduating from the Navy ROTC program at Tulane in 2006, Stephens attended flight school. He returned to New Orleans from 2017 to 2019 but has been based in Virginia Beach since 2021 and was appointed commanding officer last year. Shoup, a Falls Church native, attended St. Stephen’s School in Alexandria. He began flying with his dad, a private pilot, around age 7 and earned his private pilot’s license when he turned 18. A few years after graduating from Virginia Tech, where he studied aerospace engineering and watched Michael Vick lead the Hokies to an appearance in the 1999 national title game, Shoup decided he would rather be flying high-performance airplanes instead. He enrolled in flight school in 2005 and was flying F-18s by the fall of 2007. Stephens and Shoup have done flyovers before but never alongside each other. Stephens performed the flyover at last year’s American Athletic Conference title game, which Tulane won to earn a spot in the Cotton Bowl. Shoup, who has performed a flyover at Virginia Tech’s Lane Stadium, was the ground controller for that game, communicating via radio with Stephens, another pilot and the production crew to ensure they flew over the stadium at the precise time. On Wednesday, Stephens and Shoup will take off from Joint Base Andrews about an hour before kickoff. They’ll fly to a designated spot about 10 miles from the stadium, where they’ll circle and await direction from Kevin Byerly, another Virginia Tech graduate based at Oceana, who will serve as their radio man on the ground. After the flyover at roughly 1,000 feet and more than 300 mph, they’ll return to Andrews, get in a car and head to the stadium, hoping to arrive by halftime. “We love doing flyovers,” Stephens said. “It’s a cool recruitment opportunity. It lets people see us, and hopefully kids think, ‘Hey, I kind of want to do that.’ It’s exciting, and we love being a part of people’s experience during the game.” Stephens is looking forward to seeing his alma mater in a bowl game in person. Last year, he was planning to go to the Cotton Bowl to see the Green Wave take on heavily favored Southern California, but his wife talked him out of it, suggesting Tulane would get destroyed. Instead, the Green Wave scored 16 points in the final four minutes of regulation to upset the Trojans, 46-45, in one of the most thrilling games of the bowl season. “My roommates all through college went and were sending me videos throughout the game,” Stephens said. “I’m not going to miss that opportunity again.” Stephens and Shoup wagered a bottle of Colonel E.H. Taylor rye on the outcome of Wednesday’s game. Stephens doesn’t feel great about the Green Wave’s chances. “I’m a little concerned for Tulane,” he said. “They lost their head coach [Willie Fritz, who was hired by Houston]. The quarterback [Michael Pratt] who set all the school records isn’t going to play. They will have their badass freshman running back [Makhi Hughes], but I think they may be a little one-dimensional, so I’m not talking any trash. I’m just there for a good time.” “I think we’re both just happy that they’re in a bowl,” said Shoup, who follows the Hokies less closely now than he did before becoming a father of three but made it to a game in Blacksburg in October. “We’ll have families there, hopefully staying warm and having fun. It’s awesome that our two teams are playing, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to do it.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/26/military-bowl-flyover-tulane-virginia-tech/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 08:00:00,
"Several weeks before he was ousted as CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman called up his longtime mentor, billionaire Peter Thiel, to talk about how to overcome one of the biggest challenges for his company. To meet soaring demand for ChatGPT’s ever-expanding capabilities and make the huge profits Altman envisioned, OpenAI needed massive computer firepower. Several weeks before he was ousted as CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman called up his longtime mentor, billionaire Peter Thiel, to talk about how to overcome one of the biggest challenges for his company. To meet soaring demand for ChatGPT’s ever-expanding capabilities and make the huge profits Altman envisioned, OpenAI needed massive computer firepower. Altman confided to Thiel that he was looking to create a chips company, a massively expensive undertaking due to the cost of manufacturing. To raise the capital, he would   to the Middle East, including Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, and possibly tap his powerful Silicon Valley network, including Thiel’s Founders Fund and Vinod Khosla, both backers of OpenAI. Altman had spent much of 2023   and the tech media, seeking to show how careful his company was being about protecting against the risks of AI. He’d told them about how he held almost no stock in OpenAI, how he wanted to make the process of regulating AI more democratic, and how his company’s unique structure secured AI systems in the hands of nonprofit directors. But now, here he was chatting up investors in the Middle East with ties to authoritarian regimes, spinning up a deal with the same boundary-pushing ambition that Altman had perfected in a career brimming with contradictions. From his teens into his 30s, Altman, the college dropout, dealmaking prodigy and investing wiz behind ChatGPT, has seemed to leap from one success to another. He won the attention and dollars of Silicon Valley’s elites, who were impressed by the ambitious and savvy Stanford sophomore’s likely ascent to greater things. He rose to the top of the Valley’s   of start-ups at age 26. Industry stars such as Thiel, Khosla, and Paul Graham saw in Altman a magnetic figure who could expand the tech sector’s approach across the world.  from the AI start-up,   for his restoration, and   to his perch as CEO lifted him to a new level of fame, cementing his place in the small canon of the tech world’s household names. “We believe Sam is the best leader for OpenAI,” said OpenAI spokeswoman Hannah Wong. “The strong support from his team underscores that he is an effective CEO who is open to different points of view, willing to tackle complex challenges, and who demonstrates care for his team.” Through a spokeswoman, Altman declined to be interviewed. Yet Altman’s tumble last month over his   of OpenAI, coming on the heels of the global surge of fear and excitement over the powers and pitfalls of the company’s ChatGPT chatbot, did not come out of nowhere. Altman’s critics have long harbored questions about his   and motives. OpenAI’s board was briefed on Altman’s efforts to raise funds for a chips venture in the Middle East, according to four people familiar with the fundraising drive. It was unrelated to the decision to fire Altman, two of the people said. Still, it was hard to figure out “what angle he’s working in a given situation,” one of the people said. In a Silicon Valley milieu in which shooting star companies often give birth to cults of personality around firms’ founders, Altman has stood out. An investor with a dizzying array of interests, Altman might lack the singular focus of a Steve Jobs — or the sophisticated technical skills to create the products he sells — but according to fans and rivals, he has had since an early age an uncanny entrepreneurial energy and a force of will that inspires others to do their creative best. This article is based on more than two dozen interviews with current and former colleagues, competitors, friends of Altman and others in the industry, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive personal relationships or business dealings conducted in confidence. To some, Altman could be awkward and even antisocial. Even when he throws a party, “he retreats into his room pretty quickly. He has a timer or social clock where he needs to stop socializing,” said investor Lachy Groom, a close friend. “He’s not a schmoozer.” Another close friend, investor Keith Rabois, recalled how when he first met Altman, he spent their first hangout glued to two different phones. Yet last spring, at a   with about 60 members of Congress, Altman alternately wowed the politicians with talk about the potential of AI, captivating them with a demonstration of how quickly ChatGPT could spin up a floor speech, and implored them to impose guardrails on the technology he himself had unleashed. AI, Altman revealed, was a supremely useful tool, not a creepy creature of science fiction. Altman was,  , unflappable, confident, comforting. “I’ve never met anyone as smart as Sam,” said Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who spent extensive time with Altman in Sun Valley, Idaho, last summer. “He’s an introvert and shy and humble, and all of those are things that are not normal for people on the Hill. But he’s very good at forming relationships with people on the Hill and he can help folks in government understand AI.” Around the world, Altman’s manner seemed to assure everyone from national leaders to a 15-year-old high school student in Toronto who had been diagnosed with cancer and asked Altman for help with his research in 2021. “It’s very scary when a new, ambitious tech company comes out and says, ‘We’re going to build God, and we’re going make sure that it benefits all of humanity,’” said Arnav Shah, who became pen pals with the mogul. “But I’m 100 percent certain that if anyone is going to build this thing ... it should be him. I literally cannot think of someone that I would trust more that has more pure intentions.” His uncanny sense of the next big thing has led him to back hundreds of start-ups including a new utopian city, longevity and nuclear fusion ventures and Vita Brevis, a San Francisco speakeasy focused on art. He meshed with a brand of Silicon Valley investor who some see as proto-philosopher-kings, influential figures expected to have a take on the economy, world politics, and the shape of the future. Altman is given to grand statements about politics (“Democracy only works in a growing economy”) and even considered a run for California governor after   was elected president. Altman has courted these comparisons. “You also want to be an exponential curve yourself — you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory,” he wrote in a blog post titled “How to Be Successful” in 2019. But in recent weeks, following the internal drama at OpenAI, friends say Altman’s unusual ability to tolerate extraordinary doses of stress seemed to waver. first and last time i ever wear one of these  Altman has presented himself as an avatar of altruism, but his AI venture has run into crosscurrents of concern about the technology’s potential impact on the world’s economy and  human lives. The larger-than-life characters who become celebrity CEOs in Silicon Valley are sometimes tech wizards and sometimes hard-driving business builders, but always   about their goals, motives and methods. In Altman’s case, his employees, competitors, admirers and critics argue over his sometimes-cavalier attitude toward others (he says he’s not interested in “most people”) and his contradictory positions on AI (he warned against the technology’s role in fueling disinformation and erasing jobs, then pushed out ChatGPT knowing it was not protected against errors and offensive statements.) “Sam is the only person I’ve ever known who, where there’s a one-percent chance of a trillion-dollar outcome, that’s something to be leaned into,” said a person who worked closely with Altman. “The entire venture industry would run to the hills if you told them you should invest in this thing that is going to cost a ton of money and only has a one-percent chance of succeeding. But Sam would be like, ‘Interesting — how big can it be?’” For almost a decade, Altman, 38, has been one of the tech world’s foremost fireballs of investment energy. He won devotion — and dollars — from prominent investors, including his key early mentors, Thiel and Paul Graham, a founder of Y Combinator, the tech start-up incubator that Altman would come to run. “You could parachute him into an island full of cannibals and come back in five years and he’d be the king,” Graham  . “Honestly, Sam is, along with Steve Jobs, the founder I refer to most when I’m advising start-ups. On questions of design, I ask ‘What would Steve do?’ but on questions of strategy or ambition I ask, ‘What would Sama do?’” He referred to Altman by his nickname, which is also his handle on Twitter and the tech forum Hacker News. When Altman was in college, Graham said, within three minutes of meeting him, “I remember thinking ‘Ah, so this is   when he was 19.’” What Graham saw was not a deep knowledge of technology but rather “toughness, adaptability, determination.… Those are the qualities you need to win.” Altman first came to the attention of the Valley’s most prominent investors when his start-up, Loopt, won support from Y Combinator. Loopt, which he developed with his boyfriend, Nick Sivo, at Stanford, let smartphone users find and meet nearby people and preceded a booming market for using phones’ location data. Getting   — in a first batch of investments that included the social media giant Reddit — ended up being more important than Loopt’s own future. The company was never particularly successful, though Rabois noted that Altman successfully brokered deals for Loopt with all of the major telecom companies — an early sign of his knack for selling ideas to powerful people. At 19, Altman “seemed like he had a 40-year-old inside him,” wrote Graham, a founder of the incubator. “There are other 19-year-olds who are 12 inside.” Altman would never resort to an “I’m just a kid” defense when challenged by his elders, Graham said; rather, his response to “That’s a stupid idea” was “simply to look the other person in the eye and say ‘Really? Why do you think so?’” His most vital supporter was Thiel, the most high-profile gay man in Silicon Valley and Altman’s adviser and friend at least since he sold Loopt to the prepaid card company Green Dot for $43 million in 2012. Soon after the sale, which Altman has described as disappointing (his take was $5 million), he raised $21 million — mostly from Thiel — to start his own venture capital fund, called Hydrazine Capital. He launched it with his brother Jack, who lived with Sam in his four-bedroom house on Dorland Street in San Francisco’s Mission District. He became a part-time partner at Y Combinator and then, in 2014, its president, shocking some of his peers. Altman’s bond with Thiel blossomed: He helped Thiel’s venture firm, Founder’s Fund, get access to hot start-ups, and the men sometimes traveled together to speak at events. “It’s not just a friendship, like going around playing golf,” said a person familiar with the relationship. “It’s something much deeper than that. Sam has to be one of the two or three people closest to Peter.” The person said the Thiel-Altman tie had only one parallel: Thiel’s close bond with another young man whose star quickly ascended in Silicon Valley: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Thiel declined to comment. People who know the men say Thiel’s style and approach to business appears to have shaped Altman. For example, Altman has been criticized  , undermining open-source technology and pushing smaller companies to launch products through its platform — a strategy Thiel outlined in his book “Zero to One.” Thiel has long seeded up-and-coming mentees with capital and access to his powerful network. Altman has adopted the same tactic: He’d connect people for future jobs and deals with one-line emails that say simply, “Meet,” according to another person who has worked with him. Both men are private but consummate networkers, known for opening their many homes and throwing parties. Thiel’s holiday parties in Los Angeles and Miami are top-shelf events for Silicon Valley’s elite. Guests who have attended gatherings at Altman’s San Francisco house — he also owns homes in Hawaii and Napa Valley — described it as warm, with candles and friends offering blankets to curl up in, a welcome contrast with Altman’s sometimes awkward manner. People who know Altman from his Y Combinator days say that while some start-ups felt ignored by him, the young investor paid attention to the people and companies who mattered most: “His greatest gift was making the two most important people in his life happy: Paul Graham and Peter Thiel,” said one of the people. “I’ve had this conversation about what makes Sama special a hundred times,” said a venture-backed start-up founder who travels in similar circles. “He’s really good at the whole mafia thing. It’s almost like a secret society. There’s a reason why so many presidents come from Yale’s Skull and Bones.” The close friend agreed that Altman’s ability to convene useful people is key to his success. “He’s just cultivated such good, candid relationships that he can use them to make magic,” the friend said. “People have been real advocates for him when he was unproven, and to some degree he is paying that forward.” Altman is renowned for his loyalty to those he cares about. A janitor from his time at Loopt still works for Altman. Altman does not have regularly scheduled meetings, but responds to messages instantly, according to his personal coach, Matt Mochary. “People inside the company get unblocked instantly and people outside the company feel totally loved” he said on a podcast. “He does this to people who are in his circle of ‘I want you to feel loved.’” At Y Combinator, Altman went virtually overnight from a well-connected wunderkind to one of the best-known figures in Silicon Valley. As he transformed the incubator from scrappy start-up boot camp into an investment powerhouse with tentacles in distant places and fields, it in turn made him a star. “Once he took over YC,” a colleague said, “he felt like he could get a meeting with anyone.” Altman started putting his own spin on things immediately. Less than a month after Graham named him successor, Altman put out the call for wildly ambitious founders building start-ups around breakthrough technologies, invoking Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla as examples. He listed areas like energy, AI, transportation and housing, internet infrastructure and education as of interest. “Now small start-ups can do what used to take the resources of nations,” Altman enthused on his personal blog. “There was a profound change in the companies YC admitted after Sam became leader,” one of the people who worked with Altman said. “He used Y Combinator as a platform to do other things, and the seeds of his demise were also there.” Multiple people described Altman as a hands-off manager who picked potential winners and gave those people great autonomy so he could move on to his other interests. Even at OpenAI, Altman “sees himself more like an investor than a typical CEO,” another close friend said. This style led to Altman being  his role at Y Combinator, according to four people familiar with Altman’s work there. Some perceived him as aloof and absent. He told people what they wanted to hear, said three of the people. Other leaders resented Altman “hogging credit” for building successful start-ups, the colleagues said. Colleagues came to see Altman as off doing his own thing at OpenAI and investing in Y Combinator companies with his own personal fund, Hydrazine. Grumbling emerged that he was reaping enormous personal profits without building and advising those companies. (Other partners also invested in YC companies on the side, according to two of the people.) In 2019, that sentiment led to Graham flying into San Francisco from Britain, where he was living in semi-retirement after having children. People at Y Combinator hadn’t seen Graham in years. Graham convened a short meeting with company leaders. Then Altman was asked to leave the room. Graham explained that Altman would not be returning to YC as president. Five years after Altman took over the influential incubator, Graham said he had had no idea that Altman had been spending so little time nurturing start-ups at the organization and so much energy tending to his own projects, the people said. Graham and his wife were “his biggest fans and his enablers,” said one of the people describing their relationship at the time. Then “they flipped.” In an email to The Washington Post, Graham said his wife, Jessica Livingston, a Y Combinator founding partner, had encouraged Altman to step aside before his own visit to San Francisco, after the couple learned that he was going to be CEO of OpenAI’s new for-profit arm. “Since he agreed immediately, it would be misleading to use the word ‘fired’ to describe this,” he wrote. He did not respond to follow-up questions. the first day of openai, seven years ago today  A story Altman told about himself at a Y Combinator event symbolized his bold style: Trying to win a big client, Altman flew to the company’s headquarters and sat in its lobby all day until they agreed to see him, according to  . After several meetings, the leaders said they wanted to visit Altman’s offices. At the time, Altman’s firm consisted of only five people, so he hired some college friends to make his business look bigger. He said the scheme worked and he got the contract. Altman’s tactics generate plenty of debate in the Valley. Friends say he seems to work without stress, ever busy, ever on the phone. Yet others point to the same personality traits and see a salesman who knew few limits. “Ambition isn’t quite the right word to describe Sam,” said Groom, the close friend. “It’s something more like an inclination to say ‘Why not think bigger?’ AI companies might say, let’s try to raise 10 billion. Sam says, let’s do 100 billion — and there’s kind of a casualness about it. He has sort of an unbounded way of thinking.” He learned to program when he was 8. He told his brother when they played board games as children that “I have to win and I’m in charge of everything.” Son of a real estate developer and a dermatologist, he dropped out of college to start a business. He grew up in the suburbs of St. Louis and inherited an outsider sensibility that Thiel attributed to his Jewish identity, describing Altman’s belief system to the New Yorker as “things can always go deeply wrong and that there’s no single place in the world where you’re deeply at home.” He drives himself hard, accumulating roughly 18 pounds of muscle mass  . “I started off my career in life as a very anxious, high-strung person,” Altman told the Art of Accomplishment podcast last year. It left him, he said, “somewhat miserable ... tremendously less effective and a much worse leader.” Then he discovered meditation — his younger sister Annie, who has since cut off contact with her family, said she told Sam and her other brothers about the practice and they teased her about it, so years later, she said she was startled to find Sam had taken it on. More recently, though, Sam said on the podcast, he has mostly stopped meditating, partly because he doesn’t want to lose his motivation to work. He and Musk, the CEO of Tesla and owner of what used to be Twitter, created OpenAI as a nonprofit with the aim of warning and protecting the world against a technology Musk believed could wipe out humanity by accident. Altman appeared to agree: “Development of superhuman machine intelligence is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity,” he wrote on his  , adding that it “does not have to be the inherently evil sci-fi version to kill us all.” But the technology’s promise was too brilliant to pass up. It just needed the right regulation, and he wanted to set up a global governing board to erect boundaries for the tool’s use. Annie said around that time her brother was more fixated on human threats, like famine or riots, that could trigger violence. “People have small motivation to steal when they have housing and food,” she recalled telling him after he’d made a big purchase of guns and gold. By the time the company launched, Altman’s rhetoric on AI risk seemed to become more modulated. Some of Altman’s other political initiatives have remained stuck at the experimental stage. Sometimes described as a centrist Democrat, Altman from early on took public stands against Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential bid, calling Trump “abusive, erratic, and prone to fits of rage,” as well as “unfit to be president.” But Altman also credited Trump with being “ ” and rebuffed calls from some tech workers for him to spurn his friend Thiel, who had become an outspoken advocate for Trump. Some tech workers accused Altman of trying to co-opt their political movement rather than mounting any enduring effort to push back against Trump. Early in his presidency, when Trump threatened to create a registry of Muslims in the United States, many liberal tech workers signed a   pledge, vowing not to build such a directory. Altman responded by calling an   in which employees were asked to write down ideas for “Tech Worker Values,” but the initiative faded away. That same year, Altman launched an experiment to provide   — enough money to live on, he said — to a sample group in Oakland, Calif., to see if a cash giveaway might substitute for the traditional work that AI could eliminate. “As technology continues to eliminate traditional jobs and massive new wealth gets created, we’re going to see some version of this at a national scale,”  . “So it would be good to answer some of the theoretical questions now. Do people sit around and play video games, or do they create new things? Are people happy and fulfilled?” Altman increasingly argued that “AI could lead to resource abundance,” meaning it could eliminate massive numbers of jobs and concentrate resources in the hands of a few, said Matt Krisiloff, a friend and former colleague of Altman’s who spearheaded the universal income project and now heads a fertility start-up that Altman invested in. “He has a belief that if one day an AI can really operate as a human — and you have factories producing robots that can do infrastructure work or farming ...,” it will be “very important to figure out how those resources get distributed fairly for everyone to benefit.” Altman said a guaranteed income would “make real progress towards eliminating poverty.” He proposed to give 100 families in Oakland $1,500 a month. When the experiment began in 2020, the terms had changed: 1,000 people were to get $1,000 a month, and a control group of 2,000 people would get $50 a month, and the location had moved. The experiment, which Altman started with $10 million, is ongoing, with results expected in 2024, said Elizabeth Rhodes, research director of OpenResearch, an Altman-funded operation. Altman has not given up on the idea and has agreed not to talk about it while the experiment is ongoing. “I would bet anything he had no idea what he was getting himself into,” Rhodes said. “He was probably thinking of self-funding a smaller thing.… In Silicon Valley there are a lot of short attention spans, but he’s stayed consistent.” The consistency broke, according to some friends and critics of Altman, when he released ChatGPT, triggering the kind of corporate arms race OpenAI was founded to prevent. Still, the controversy at OpenAI that led to Altman’s firing and rehiring last month turned not so much on the existential question of how dangerous artificial intelligence will be, but on who would control the path forward for the world’s leading AI company — a battle that has caused schisms inside the start-up for years. Altman and Musk founded OpenAI in 2015 in part because they were worried that Google had acquired DeepMind, an AI pioneer, and seemed to be hurtling toward dominance. OpenAI recruited some of DeepMind’s talent, setting the company up as a nonprofit that they said would work for humanity’s benefit rather than financial returns. Altman eventually took control of OpenAI after a dramatic upheaval triggered by Musk. Musk, according to two people familiar with the internal discussions, was frustrated by the lack of progress and proposed to cut half of OpenAI’s staff — a move Altman rejected. Altman, by contrast, believed OpenAI desperately needed more money to amp up its computer power and compete for talent with tech giants. Altman’s solution was to transform the company into a for-profit enterprise, though it would still be governed by a nonprofit board. The shift helped Altman secure a $1 billion  . hello from redmond! excited for the event tomorrow  Altman played a central role in selecting board members, said a person familiar with the board’s dealings. “Either they were his friends or they were people who can never go up against Sam without being destroyed,” the person said. The transition to a for-profit masked internal tensions. Executives complained, to one another and openly, about Altman’s management style,  . “He will figure out what you want to hear,” one said. “It gets rid of the problem, but turns out to not be lasting in any way.” Seeking to ease the friction, Altman brought in his coach, Mochary, in 2018, but employees worried he was reporting private conversations back to the CEO, according to two people familiar with the environment Similar concerns led to the board’s decision in 2023, according to three people familiar with the proceedings. The Post   review of Altman’s behavior was triggered by complaints of senior leaders alleging manipulative behavior and retaliation. In the end, Altman’s reputation has only been burnished by his temporary downfall. “I don’t think he is a bully,” said Khosla, who declined to comment on the chip venture. “He just asks hard questions, and sometimes people are threatened by it.” “He’s the kind of founder that can bend reality,” said Hemant Taneja, a friend of Altman’s and managing director of the venture capital firm General Catalyst, adding that Altman had invited him to invest in OpenAI but that he declined because he couldn’t understand the company’s complex structure. “By creating the fastest and most popular consumer application of generative AI, he showed us the art of the possible. … This is the first technology where every CEO of every company in every industry is now thinking about how to do AI in their business. He made that happen.” A previous version of this article incorrectly identified Elon Musk as the founder of Tesla. Musk is the CEO of Tesla. The article has been corrected.

"Scouts and defensive coaches are raving about an NFC West team that is bruising and confounding opponents on a weekly basis, using a core of shape-shifting, position-toggling offensive weapons and a top-five quarterback to go on a remarkable tear following its bye … only it’s not the one you’re thinking of. Scouts and defensive coaches are raving about an NFC West team that is bruising and confounding opponents on a weekly basis, using a core of shape-shifting, position-toggling offensive weapons and a top-five quarterback to go on a remarkable tear following its bye … only it’s not the one you’re thinking of. Yes, the San Francisco offense has been all the rage this season, at least before the 49ers were drubbed by the Ravens on Monday night. Kyle Shanahan has been widely hailed for his offense — and rightfully so — while the polarizing Brock Purdy was the MVP favorite going into Week 16. But within the sport, Shanahan’s old coaching buddy Sean McVay and his Los Angeles Rams, led by quarterback Matthew Stafford, are being discussed in a similarly reverent manner. While the Rams don’t rely on hybrid running back/wide receiver combos in the mold of Christian McCaffrey and Deebo Samuel, they have their own rare blend of interchangeable weapons (Cooper Kupp and Puka Nacua), embodying some of the same core principles that have guided Shanahan and McVay to the top of the NFL’s coaching paradigm. (Oh, and both have former head coaches serving as defensive coordinators in San Francisco’s Steve Wilks and L.A.’s Raheem Morris, who both deserve another opportunity to run their own teams.) Stafford and the Rams’ potent mix have brought showtime football back to Los Angeles despite many predicting a lengthy rebuild after the Rams   to fuel   in early 2022. They have revived a season that appeared dead heading into their Week 10 bye at 3-6, off three straight losses in which they amassed a total of 40 points. The Rams are averaging 29.8 points during a 5-1 tear since, the loss coming on a punt return in overtime on a rainy day in Baltimore in which the Rams hung 31 points on the vaunted Ravens defense. “It’s always about the players, and we got a couple of people back healthy,” McVay said in a phone conversation after reviewing film of his team’s Thursday night victory over the Saints. “That’s where it starts. I think a lot of people don’t realize how big Matthew’s thumb injury was, and Cooper really got that ankle feeling a little bit better, and then getting [running back] Kyren Williams back, too. “The guys getting a little bit of rest really came at a good time for us, just being able to recommit to some of our foundational philosophies and being able to have some early-down marriage of the run and pass. And you can only do that if you’re able to be efficient, and you have to be able to run it and throw it if you want to be a good offense. So our guys have done a good job executing, and we’ve done a really nice job of being able to play up front, and we have some really nice continuity [on the offensive line] that we haven’t had for a couple of years. We’re sturdy on the interior of the offensive line and on the edges, and Matthew has a really good rapport with these players, and that has really helped us get the offense going.” Stafford’s play has been sublime since the bye. His accuracy was ailing and he was abysmal when under pressure the first 10 weeks (38 percent completion percentage under pressure, with a 60.6 rating) as he dealt with elbow issues and the offensive line shuffled. The running game also sputtered while alternating backs by the week as Williams, a second-year sparkplug they plucked in the fifth round, recovered from an ankle injury. (The Rams have crushed the late rounds of the draft lately while going seven years without a first-round selection.) Much was asked of the QB, and physically he did not seem up for it. But since the bye, Stafford has been able to contort his arm angles freely again. His fastball is all the way back, and his ball placement has been uncanny on deep throws. He has thrown 15 touchdowns to just two interceptions since the bye, with a sparkling 107.7 rating while averaging 263 yards; he has at least two touchdown passes in five straight games. “He is playing elite football,” said a top defensive coach on a team that recently faced the Rams, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he is not permitted to publicly discuss other teams. “His arm angles and accuracy are phenomenal.” A high-ranking executive on a team that recently faced the Rams said: “He’s playing his [behind] off and they’re very well coached, but I still think you can get to him with pressure. You look at some of the teams they’ll see in the playoffs, and that’s going to be their issue. I think you can blitz them.” The Rams are also confusing opposing coordinators with their personnel. As always, they espouse 11 personnel (three receivers and one tight end) and are using it now more than ever — 94 percent of the time this season, the most in the NFL and the highest rate of McVay’s career. They are in 11 personnel a remarkable 97 percent of the time since the bye. If it sounds predictable, it’s anything but. Determining which of their big-bodied and physical receivers is going to run which routes, and which might actually be the tight end in that formation or even serve as a second running back, causes nightmares. Having shiftable pieces such as Kupp and Nacua (a breakout fifth-round pick) who also get opportunities in the running game allows McVay to further decoy and confuse. “The pass game with McVay is like the run game with Shanahan,” said a longtime scout who has studied both offenses closely on film. “The offense is not complex. They do it with different formation shifts and motions, but it’s really the same plays over and over.” The defensive coach said: “Sean’s system is advanced in its simplicity. He dictates to the defense with his check-with-me system and creates 21 [two running back] and 12 [two tight end] personnel groupings out of 11 personnel looks, which are really tough to defend.” The receivers make it all go. No divas here. Blocking is the rule — their wideouts room is the antithesis of Pittsburgh’s — and the Rams do it as well as anyone. With no fullback or extra tight end on the field, the receivers have no choice, and like the offensive linemen they have played no small role in Williams churning out 601 rushing yards since Week 10, doing so at a ridiculous 5.4-yards-per-carry clip and going over 100 yards in five of six games. McVay celebrates that blocking as much as their catches and touchdowns — and there is plenty to champion there, too, as either Kupp or Nacua has gone over 100 receiving yards in each of the past four games. “There’s no question about it: You reward it when you get in those team meetings,” said McVay, who is still tweaking a red-zone offense that isn’t where he would like it to be. “You’re praising those big guys up front, but you’re also getting a chance to recognize some of those second- and third-level [receiver] blocks and digging out support that springs a long Kyren Williams run. “It’s important to be able to identify and praise those moments that embody a lot of the things you are trying to instill within your culture, and nothing is more powerful than them seeing it in front of the team when they are doing it and seeing the tangible results of what happens when they do it.” The combination of health, execution and scheme maximization has catapulted the Rams to the precipice of the playoffs. They are one of the hottest teams in the NFC, and no other team in that conference boasts a Super Bowl-winning head coach and quarterback. The season’s second meeting between McVay and Shanahan, set for Week 18, now could be significant for both teams, and with how the Rams are playing a third meeting seems more possible than could have been imagined six weeks ago.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/26/rams-mcvay-stafford/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 11:00:00,

Stoney, who has led Virginia’s capital through a historic reckoning with its Confederate past and a contentious period of economic growth, announced on Monday that he will seek the Democratic nomination for governor in 2025. Stoney, 42, will try to become the second African American elected governor in Virginia’s history. His announcement tees up a tough nominating contest with U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who said  last month that she will not seek reelection to Congress so she can run for governor. “I’m running for governor because I want to give every Virginian a fair shot at success,” Stoney said in an interview Sunday with The Washington Post. “The state needs someone with the experience of running something and who can get things done for every Virginian.” First elected in 2016 as Richmond’s youngest-ever popularly elected mayor, Stoney is term-limited and had made no secret that he was pondering a gubernatorial bid. But that he and Spanberger would announce nearly two years ahead of the election signals how hard-fought — and expensive — the next Virginia governor’s race is likely to be. No Republican has declared yet for 2025, but Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Attorney Gen. Jason S. Miyares are widely thought to be positioning to seek the GOP nomination. Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), like all Virginia governors, is barred by the state constitution from seeking a second, consecutive term. His election in 2021 broke a 12-year period in which no Republican had been elected to statewide office in a Virginia that seemed to be trending blue, so Democrats are keen to take back the Executive Mansion. Stoney and Spanberger, 44, a former CIA officer, represent a new generation of Democrats — but have carved very different political paths. Spanberger has often clashed with liberal party leadership, especially former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, as she represents a swing congressional district with a large share of rural and conservative voters. Stoney leads a diverse city with urban problems of crime and a troubled school system, and has both courted the young, liberal wing of the party and been criticized for seeming friendly with corporate interests and developers. Before becoming mayor, Stoney was a close confidant of former governor Terry McAuliffe (D), serving as secretary of the commonwealth during the first years of McAuliffe’s administration. In that role, Stoney helped lead efforts to restore voting rights to some 200,000 Virginians who had lost their rights because they served time for felonies. Stoney was born in New York and moved at a young age to Hampton Roads, where he was raised by his father — a custodian — and grandmother. “I grew up in a working poor family,” he said. “I know what feels like to struggle. If it wasn’t for strong family and strong education, I wouldn’t be where I am today.” Stoney served as class president and played quarterback for Tabb High School in York County, near Newport News, and became the first person in his family to attend college. He graduated from James Madison University with a degree in public administration and political science. After college, Stoney worked for then-governor Mark R. Warner (D) and became executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia in 2008, then began a long mentorship, and friendship, with McAuliffe. In his two terms as mayor of Richmond — a position once held by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D), a former governor, as well as L. Douglas Wilder (D), the first Black person elected governor of any state — Stoney’s youthful enthusiasm coincided with a time of rapid growth and renewal. Moribund parts of the city have opened up to development with an influx of young workers, and the city became renowned for its thriving restaurant and brewery scene. Stoney takes credit for cleaning up the city’s finances and repairing its broken infrastructure. A recent city report showed that Richmond’s poverty rate has dropped by more than 20 percent, and Stoney noted that Travel & Leisure magazine in September  the best place to live in Virginia. But Stoney also misfired on a couple of development projects. He championed a massive downtown proposal called Navy Hill that was rejected by the city council, and threw his weight behind two losing campaigns to pass referendums allowing a casino on the city’s struggling Southside. Stoney left an indelible mark on the city, though, during the 2020 racial equity protests over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota. Richmond’s parade of Confederate statues along Monument Avenue became the focal point of nightly protest rallies and an international symbol of the struggle to overcome racial divisions. When protesters pulled down a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, Stoney acted quickly, invoking a brand-new state law giving localities power over their public monuments to declare that a dozen Confederate monuments were coming down. His city attorney refused to endorse the plan, so Stoney hired a   — the only firm that would take the job — and ordered the work to get underway immediately. As the  , a likeness of Stonewall Jackson, Stoney stayed at an undisclosed location so opponents could not serve him with a subpoena that might stop the work. “Those statues were symbols of a time that no longer exists in the city of Richmond,” Stoney said. “This is a Richmond that is more inclusive, more welcoming to everyone.” Stoney and his wife, Brandy, an entrepreneur, are expecting their first child. His first marriage ended in divorce. He has hired a political staff and plans to ramp up travels around the state. His campaign released a  Monday that introduces Stoney as someone whose dedicated father and humble roots gave him the drive to succeed, and casting Youngkin as someone more interested in his own ambition than the good of the state.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/04/virginia-richmond-mayor-levar-stoney-governor-2025/,Washington Post,2023-12-04 06:00:00,

When the New York Liberty’s Courtney Vandersloot sailed a three-pointer wide of the hoop with the clock ticking down, a thrilling Game 4 of the WNBA Finals ended, and the Las Vegas Aces emerged as back-to-back champions. The series pitted two teams overflowing with stars and was the  , the latest data point that more fans are paying attention to women’s basketball. But for a league that has been clamoring for more coverage since its inception, the game’s aftermath hinted at continued growing pains. The famous scenes of athletes celebrating in champagne-soaked locker rooms never emerged because cameras were not allowed to capture them. A number of reporters and TV outlets requested to speak with some of the Liberty’s stars, including Sabrina Ionescu and Jonquel Jones, but the players did not talk to them. The entire Aces team, meanwhile, visited the media room for a news conference but, amid the celebration, didn’t answer some questions to offer insight into how they won the game. “In decades of covering sports, have never seen this happen,” Barbara Barker, a columnist at Newsday,  What looked from the outside like a mishandled moment for a league acclimating to a higher profile, though, was a window into a larger dynamic, according to interviews with nearly 20 reporters and officials around the WNBA. The league, reporters said, often falls short of making itself more accessible to the media, even as its leaders rebuke the media for a lack of coverage,  . Just two years ago, the Phoenix Mercury declined to speak to reporters after losing in the Finals. (The league fined the Mercury $10,000 then; this year the Liberty was fined $25,000 and three players $2,000 for not following the league’s media policies.) “Women’s sports is at a tipping point,” said Lindsay Schnell, a reporter for USA Today who has covered the WNBA. “People are watching. They want stories behind the scenes and information about the players. Shouldn’t the oldest professional women’s league be leading the charge? Instead, they’re the worst.” The league declined to make Commissioner Cathy Engelbert available but said it received few complaints this season about access to players. WNBA spokesman Ron Howard said in a statement that the league would implement mandated media training for players and would issue more significant fines for players who do not follow protocols. Terri Jackson, executive director of the Women’s National Basketball Players Association, pushed back against any assertion that players did not prioritize speaking to reporters. “Our players are the most accessible professional athletes out there,” she said. “They stop and talk to anyone and everyone, almost to their detriment. They don’t turn down interviews. We’re looking for established, credible outlets and writers to be in and around this space to help grow this game.” In an interview, union president Nneka Ogwumike, who plays for the Los Angeles Sparks, said she welcomed more media coverage but that players still were growing accustomed to increased visibility. “There have been times as women athletes where there’s this idea that our accessibility is taken for granted,” she said. “But you know you have a responsibility. It’s part of our job, and I think at times you have to square what that means, as a professional and a woman.” Questions over access have been increasingly common across men’s and women’s sports in recent years as news outlets contract and social media allows athletes more ways to reach fans directly. But reporters around the league said the WNBA was unique because it is asking for more coverage but then shutting down reporters trying to fill that gap. The league closed locker rooms to reporters last season, which meant reporters must rely on PR staffs to facilitate interactions, including one-on-one conversations. Several reporters also said they have been told by teams that they are bad for women’s basketball if they write something a team doesn’t like. Over the years, reporters said they have repeatedly raised the issue of improving media relations to the league office. Subria Whitaker, who has covered the Chicago Sky and also worked with WNBA players on their personal media strategies, suggested there was a lack of understanding between both players and reporters on the primary function of the media. “Players are unclear on the jobs of media,” she said. “Because of the general distrust of media and the biases we’ve seen, players tend to gravitate toward media members who have spoken about them more positively, and that’s not fair.” That includes how to respond to critical coverage. After the Chicago Sun-Times  , a player confronted the reporter during a postgame news conference and asked: “Are you with us or against us?” “I hear from everyone in town — Bears, Blackhawks, all the teams — about our coverage, but I’ve never had reporters be targeted like the Sky reporters have been,” Sun-Times sports editor Chris De Luca said. Adam Fox, president of the Chicago Sky, said he couldn’t imagine the Sky being more difficult than any other team, adding that the team hired a new coach and general manager and would be prioritizing media training with players under the new regime. “We should be treated like any other league should be treated,” he said. “Pros, cons, everything that goes into it.” The WNBA, launched in 1997, came of age as local newspapers started to struggle financially, and has long scratched and clawed for coverage. Today, the league says there are just two outlets that regularly travel with teams, The Washington Post and the Sun-Times. Four years ago, the Athletic announced a big expansion of its WNBA coverage, hiring freelancers to cover each beat, but has since canceled the project. Players have their own grievances, beyond the historic lack of coverage. Reporters show up for moments when the league transcends sports, Jackson said, such as when Brittney Griner returned home from detention in Russia, but not for their games. And media that are credentialed and cover teams regularly are part-time journalists or writing for fan websites, one of the main reasons players pushed to close their locker rooms ahead of this season. Further,   found that White WNBA players received disproportionately more coverage than Black players. Ogwumike said she has done interviews in which reporters repeatedly mispronounced her name and that players have been frustrated by the monotony of coverage, with the same handful of players getting so much of it. She said she engaged more with reporters outside of the closed locker room, too. “Press conferences didn’t feel as obligatory as someone hovering over my locker,” she said. ""I felt like I could be in a better space and have a better conversation.” Another factor, reporters said, is that team PR staffs are often less experienced than other leagues and suffer from high turnover rates. Those staffers are often doing multiple jobs for a team, in addition to coordinating player interviews. Nancy Armour, a columnist at USA Today, put some of the blame on the NBA, which launched the league and owns 50 percent of it. “Nobody in the NBA cares about the WNBA,” she said. “When you have this dismissive attitude, it spills into other areas.” A former league staffer agreed, pointing out that the WNBA has three league office PR people, compared with around 40 globally for the NBA. (The NBA sent a statement that lauded the league’s support of the women’s game but didn’t address Armour’s criticism.) Multiple people involved in coverage of the league said media outlets played a role, too, noting that most reporters are White and the vast majority of players are people of color. Demographics across sports media skew heavily white and male —  . One WNBA reporter said that many of the national reporters for the league, though, are women and that demographics don’t stop other players in other leagues from engaging with the media. Reporters said there is often something personal about the job in a way covering another league isn’t, making the conflict sting even more. They are covering women’s basketball because they, too, believe women’s sports have been undervalued and under-covered. “I’ve been doing this for 40 years,” ESPN’s Michael Voepel said. “I want women’s sports to grow.” They said players are being done a disservice by those around them when reporters try to write stories that pull back the curtain but struggle to get buy-in. Agents play a role, too. Seven reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid losing more access, said Lindsay Kagawa Colas, who has represented some of the league’s biggest stars in the league, can limit access or not respond to requests for her clients. (Reporters said that they could have similar problems with other agents, too.) Colas arranged the interview with Ogwumike for this story. Her clients have recently appeared in stories in the Athletic, Sports Illustrated, Time, People and ESPN. “My clients expect, and for decades we have provided, elite and intentional strategy and services, and we seek the same level of storytelling and visibility for our women,” Colas said in a statement. “Assumptions about how I should operate, and the access our clients grant, are often rooted in a powerful double standard when compared to the men as a woman agent representing women.” Whitaker said the players association could do more. “There is education that can be provided,” she said. “There should be a mediation between players and media members, but I don’t know who would facilitate that.” A dialogue was something Jackson said she would welcome, too. “I’m disappointed if it looks like the players are to blame for this,” she said. “I know our members have been good partners in this. If there are conversations to be had or suggestions that people want to make, I think they should share those suggestions with us and with team staff and league staff.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/11/04/wnba-media-coverage/,Washington Post,2023-11-04 06:30:00,
"SAN JOSE, Calif. — Zach Hyman, Evan Bouchard and Ryan McLeod each had a goal and an assist in the first period, and the Edmonton Oilers beat the San Jose Sharks 5-0 on Thursday night.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Zach Hyman, Evan Bouchard and Ryan McLeod each had a goal and an assist in the first period, and the Edmonton Oilers beat the San Jose Sharks 5-0 on Thursday night. Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins also scored for Edmonton in the opener of a three-game California trip. Stuart Skinner made 25 saves in his second shutout of the season and No. 4 for his career. The Oilers improved to 11-3-0 in their last 14 games, rebounding from a rough start to the season. Skinner said the four-goal first period by his team gave him “a lot of confidence.” “I think we were rolling around for a good five minutes straight in their end, and that’s a huge credit to the guys being ready off the bat,” Skinner said. Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said Skinner came up with some really good saves. “We gave up a lot of shot attempts from the slot, more than we have probably in the last dozen games,” Knoblauch said. San Jose dropped its seventh straight game. It’s the longest skid for the Sharks since they lost their first 11 games of the season. San Jose has allowed four or more goals in each of its last six games. Sharks goaltender Magnus Chrona played one period in his first NHL start, making eight saves on 12 shots. “There were some good things that went on tonight, but we didn’t score a goal and we gave up five,” Sharks coach David Quinn said. “You can’t be giving up five goals. Their goalie played well. And we had some chances, it wasn’t like it was a territorial-dominated game by them. They just took advantage of our lapses and we weren’t able to take advantage of theirs.” The Oilers jumped in front 1 minute into the game. McLeod took a drop pass from Hyman and buried a wrist shot from the left circle for his fourth goal in his last four shots. Edmonton took a 2-0 lead midway through the first when Connor McDavid connected with Hyman right in front of the net for a tap-in goal. It was Hyman’s team-leading 20th goal of the season. Bouchard converted a slap shot from the left point at 14:55, and Draisaitl scored at 17:32 off an assist by Warren Foegele. “Especially coming off a break, it’s easy to wade yourself into the game and not get out to the start that you want,” defenseman Darnell Nurse said. “But for us to be able to come out here and put up four in the first period, I think it really set the tone for the game.” Chrona was promoted from the minors because Mackenzie Blackwood was out with an illness for the second straight game. He got the start after Kaapo Kahkonen played Wednesday night in a 5-1 loss in Los Angeles. But Kahkonen had to come on in relief following the first period. “We left him out to dry,” Sharks forward Tomas Hertl said. “It was his first NHL (start) and I felt really bad for him. We didn’t help him.” UP NEXT Oilers: Visit Los Angeles on Saturday night. Sharks: Visit Colorado on Sunday night. ___ AP NHL: ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2023/12/29/oilers-sharks-score/89b3de5e-a612-11ee-aacb-6f873a65763e_story.html,Washington Post,2023-12-29 02:14:00,
"A soaking rain turned much of the playing surface at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium into a sloppy mess at Wednesday afternoon’s Military Bowl. But as Kyron Drones led the charge, the slick and occasionally treacherous conditions did little to slow Virginia Tech’s rushing attack.

A soaking rain turned much of the playing surface at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium into a sloppy mess at Wednesday afternoon’s Military Bowl. But as Kyron Drones led the charge, the slick and occasionally treacherous conditions did little to slow Virginia Tech’s rushing attack. The redshirt sophomore quarterback ran for 176 yards to set a program bowl record and the defense recovered three fumbles in a 41-20 triumph over Tulane that gave the Hokies (7-6) their first winning season since 2019. Junior Bhayshul Tuten added 136 rushing yards and two touchdowns as Virginia Tech amassed 453 yards, including 362 on the ground, in its third appearance (and second win) in the Military Bowl. Tulane fell to 11-3 in its Military Bowl debut. “It was just a credit to the O-line really — just being physical up front,” said Drones, a transfer from Baylor who threw for two touchdowns, ran for one and was named the game’s most outstanding player. “That’s what we said we had to do from the get-go, and then they were able to create holes for me and Bhayshul to be able to run the ball and let us go and make plays.” Tuten’s second touchdown, with 9:33 remaining, all but sealed the outcome and gave the Hokies their first bowl victory since 2016, when they defeated Arkansas, 35-24, in the Belk Bowl. Virginia Tech had lost four straight bowl games since. Tulane recovered a fumble by Hokies wide receiver Jaylin Lane and tied the score at 17 on quarterback Kai Horton’s six-yard scramble just 2:08 into the second half. The Hokies went ahead to stay less than three minutes later via Tuten’s nine-yard run on a toss to the left. Drones, who set the Military Bowl rushing record by a quarterback, had gotten Virginia Tech into that position thanks to a 51-yard run during which he dodged defenders at the line of scrimmage and found open field up the middle. A touchdown with eight seconds left in the second quarter gave the Hokies a 17-10 lead at halftime. On second and goal at the 1-yard line, Drones threw over the middle to redshirt freshman Harrison Saint Germain (Westfield), a tight end who was pressed into service after starter Dae’Quan Wright entered the transfer portal. Virginia Tech claimed its first lead, at 10-7, on Drones’s 11-yard run with 2:20 to go in the opening quarter. Drones lost the ball while diving across the goal line, but the touchdown call stood upon review. In danger of losing the lead soon after, the Virginia Tech defense stiffened with Tulane facing first and goal at the 1. Defensive tackle Pheldarius Payne burst through the line to strip the ball from Horton, and defensive end Antwaun Powell-Ryland recovered at the 4-yard line. The soggy conditions wreaked havoc on Virginia Tech’s offense early. On third and 10 from the Hokies 39, Drones dropped back to pass but lost his grip on the ball, allowing Green Wave linebacker Tyler Grubbs to scoop and score from the 21 for a 7-0 lead with 12:01 to play in the first quarter. “It was tough sledding in the first half ... but just pounding it and pounding it,” Tuten said. “I think we were more physical than them, and we made them throw in the towel, I would say. We just totally dominated them.” Virginia Tech was in its first bowl game under Brent Pry, a former defensive coordinator at Penn State who took over in November 2021 with a mandate to revive the program. The Hokies went 3-8 in 2022 but won four of their final six regular season games this year to return to a bowl game. Tulane was playing its first game since coach Willie Fritz left for Houston after eight seasons. That left assistant Slade Nagle in charge Wednesday; Jon Sumrall, previously the coach at Troy, will be the Green Wave’s next full-time coach. Also conspicuous in his absence was Tulane quarterback Michael Pratt, the school’s career leader in passing yards and the American Athletic Conference offensive player of the year. He opted out of the bowl game to prepare for the NFL draft. “I’ve got a ton of respect for Tulane — 11 wins, [23] wins over a couple years, won the Cotton Bowl [last season],” Pry said. “It’s hard, and we’re making great progress. There’s a lot of great things happening at Virginia Tech right now, but there’s a lot of people pouring into it.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/27/military-bowl-virginia-tech-beats-tulane-kyron-drones/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 20:05:00,
"PHILADELPHIA — Karl-Anthony Towns scrunched up his face as a strange noise came from Rudy Gobert’s cellphone. Towns didn’t bother looking. He simply placed his hand over the phone, encouraging Gobert to put it away until reporters left their corner of the visitors’ locker room at Wells Fargo Center. Gobert tried to explain that he was merely scrolling TikTok and wasn’t sure what popped up on his screen. PHILADELPHIA — Karl-Anthony Towns scrunched up his face as a strange noise came from Rudy Gobert’s cellphone. Towns didn’t bother looking. He simply placed his hand over the phone, encouraging Gobert to put it away until reporters left their corner of the visitors’ locker room at Wells Fargo Center. Gobert tried to explain that he was merely scrolling TikTok and wasn’t sure what popped up on his screen. Towns told him, twice, “You’re making it worse.” Gobert finally relented with a chuckle. The Gobert-ization of the Minnesota Timberwolves might have made more sense a lot sooner had their audacious experiment of pairing two 7-foot centers — at a time when the rest of the NBA appeared to be hurdling away from featuring even one — not been met last season with such a loud thud. But in the second year, it’s becoming harder to question the fit. Gobert is back to his defensive player of the year form from his days with the Utah Jazz. Towns is healthy and playing some of the most efficient and composed basketball of his nine-year career. Anthony Edwards continues his ascension into superstardom. And the Timberwolves (21-6) find themselves off to the best start in franchise history, atop the Western Conference at the latest point of a season since 2003-04 when Kevin Garnett was the MVP and led them to the conference finals. “We have something cooking,” Towns said. These Timberwolves have gumption. It can be found in Edwards’s fearless, albeit failed, attempt to add reigning MVP Joel Embiid to his graveyard of poster victims this week. It can be found in Tim Connelly’s bold trade for Gobert, which took place in the summer of 2022 less than two months after he was hired to run the organization. Edwards was denied by Embiid, but he will tell you it was only because the officials swallowed their whistles. And just as Towns was willing to quickly step in to save Gobert from embarrassment, the team made the necessary roster and system tweaks to ensure that the Gobert trade — with all of the draft picks unloaded and millions invested — wouldn’t be viewed as yet another disaster sending the organization back into the wilderness in which it has dwelled for much of its 35-year existence. “It’s awesome to have a chance to win and have a chance to win big,” Towns said. Gobert remembers when his agent, Bouna Ndiaye, informed him of the Timberwolves’ interest in making a deal that would make him a defensive complement to the offensively gifted Towns. He got to thinking and got excited. What he envisioned for a frontcourt of two all-star-level centers is starting to take shape, albeit a year later than he expected. Because no matter what recent trends or conventional wisdom suggest, the most recent champions, with the exception of the Golden State Warriors, have gone big to win the Larry O’Brien Trophy. “Size is still the most important thing in basketball,” the 7-foot-1 Gobert said. “And, obviously, being able to guard.” Embiid might have roasted them with a season-high 51 points in a rare loss Wednesday, but the Timberwolves still lead the NBA in defensive rating, opponents’ points per game and opponents’ field goal percentage. They also already have six games this season in which they shot 50 percent while holding their opponent to 40 percent or worse. They have versatile individual defenders in Edwards, Jaden McDaniels and reserves Naz Reid and Nickeil Alexander-Walker who can be aggressive at the point of attack, unbothered because Gobert is behind them, ready to alter or reject whatever comes his way. Coach Chris Finch was touted as an offensive guru when he took over for Ryan Saunders in the middle of the 2020-21 season. He welcomed the challenge of incorporating Gobert — a center who feasts off lobs and rim runs instead of a traditional back-to-the-basket game — because Towns’s ability to score in myriad ways would seemingly prevent their talents from overlapping. “Our players are super skilled,” Finch said. “It’s not like we’re playing 1987 basketball, a bunch of guys that are just in and around the paint.” But after months of tripping over themselves, the Timberwolves began to find their footing with Gobert in February after a three-team trade deadline deal that swapped out guard D’Angelo Russell for a stabilizing presence in Mike Conley. Not only did Conley have experience playing with two all-star big men from his time with the grit-and-grind Memphis Grizzlies, but he immediately improved the team’s acclimation to Gobert after having played with him for three previous seasons in Utah. “I’m about as easy of a connector as anybody you meet. I can blend in anywhere,” Conley said. Conley’s presence also served as a reminder of the patience required in making massive trades, given it took Conley nearly a full season to adjust to playing with Gobert after Utah acquired Conley from Memphis in 2019. In one of their first conversations after their reunion in Minnesota, Conley said he had to remind Gobert, “Man, it takes time.” Even with Conley around, and Towns returning from the calf injury that kept him out for months to make a final push to the postseason, Gobert had a lapse in the regular season finale, when his frustration boiled over and   in a heated exchange during a timeout. Gobert was suspended for the first play-in game against the Los Angeles Lakers, possibly costing Minnesota the No. 7 seed and setting it up for a first-round loss to the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. “As a competitor, I wanted to go and win the championship from the first year. But that’s not how life works,” said Gobert, adding that the change this season stems from “having each other’s back. That’s the number one thing. I think we have a group of guys that have the will to overcome adversity, overcome anything that comes our way. The will to make each other better. The will to see each other shine.” This has been a bounce-back season for the Timberwolves and Towns after his injury limited him to a career-low 29 games last season, an absence that prevented him from meshing with Gobert or growing with Edwards. Towns is averaging 22.2 points and 9.5 rebounds and is only a few missed free throws from 50-40-90 shooting splits, the measure of elite scoring efficiency. He is content letting Edwards take over games or tossing lobs to Gobert, but he is also capable of dropping 40 points if the opportunity is presented. “I don’t know if it was a struggle or just not enough time,” Towns said of last season. “It could have been the same thing last year. Who knows? It’s coming together. I think it shows on our record. So just us every day sacrificing and believing in the same goal and fighting for the same thing.” Fighting for the same thing and not fighting each other. Finch said the change required a commitment from the longest-tenured player on the roster, a former No. 1 pick who entered the franchise with the weight of unrealistic expectations. But Towns is quick to remind anyone that sacrifice is nothing new for a player who has been putting winning ahead of personal stats since he was leading a stacked squad at Kentucky to the Final Four. Admittedly, his patience has been tested “a lot” as the Timberwolves kept swinging and missing on players who could complement a big man whose shooting range, ballhandling and unselfishness are coveted in a modern game predicated on skill. Andrew Wiggins, the No. 1 pick in 2014 the year before Towns, was already in Minnesota to greet Towns but never had a desire to lead. Jimmy Butler came to town and brought the blip of a postseason run, but the two never clicked and Butler left Minneapolis, torching Towns’s reputation in the process. The arrival of Edwards as the top pick in the 2020 draft lifted Minnesota back to respectability with his stunning hops and a contagious, playful personality that genuinely seeks to elevate everyone around him. The game has been more fun, and the pressure to do it all alone has exited, allowing Towns to settle into what he has always wanted to be: one of the larger planets and not the sun. “We’re not a solar system in this locker room,” Towns said. “We all have planets that we control and things that we can control that help this universe work.” The Timberwolves have the look of a contender but must contend with a miserable history that has seen the franchise advance beyond the first round of the playoffs just once. “We still have a long way to go from where I think we can be,” Gobert said. “But we’ve already given teams a lot of problems by being unique. And when you’re unique, people are going to always question it because it’s out of what people are used to seeing. But that’s also how great things happen, doing things that have never been done before.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/22/timberwolves-rudy-gobert-karl-anthony-towns/,Washington Post,2023-12-22 13:32:00,

"At a Frederick County Council hearing Tuesday, local landowners, conservation groups and recreational users pleaded their case for and against proposed zoning changes to Sugarloaf Mountain ahead of a scheduled vote next week. For a year, the mountain, known for its scenic views and sprawling trails, has been the subject of an intense zoning battle between Frederick County and Stronghold Inc., the nonprofit owners of the 3,400-acre mountain and the surrounding 20,000-acre land. At a Frederick County Council hearing Tuesday, local landowners, conservation groups and recreational users pleaded their case for and against proposed zoning changes to Sugarloaf Mountain ahead of a scheduled vote next week. For a year, the mountain, known for its scenic views and sprawling trails, has been the subject of an intense zoning battle between Frederick County and Stronghold Inc., the nonprofit owners of the 3,400-acre mountain and the surrounding 20,000-acre land. The dispute stretches back several years, and in 2022 the county’s planning commission approved the  , which would limit development and commercial logging in the mountain range and the surrounding area, among other things. The plan is awaiting a council vote to become legislation. Stronghold opposes the plan. A mountain closure from August to October exacerbated tensions over the proposal. Stronghold officials said at the time that they closed the mountain because of a burglary attempt. In an interview Wednesday, John Webster, Stronghold’s president, also blamed the prolonged closure on cement repairs for a popular road. But some supporters of the plan have accused Stronghold of using the closure as leverage over the council. Stronghold’s attorneys had previously threatened to close Sugarloaf if the county didn’t fulfill their zoning requests. In a   in the Frederick News-Post earlier this month, Walter C. Martz II, Stronghold’s attorney, reiterated the nonprofit organization’s opposition to the county’s zoning plans. “Any additional restrictions,” he wrote, “will impact Stronghold’s operation and maintenance of Sugarloaf Mountain.” On Tuesday night, more than 50 people filled Winchester Hall in Frederick for a public hearing on the Sugarloaf quandary. About a third wore green “Sugarloaf Alliance” shirts to support the zoning restrictions. Proposed amendments are due Thursday. If the council accepts them, the council would delay a vote on the plan scheduled for next Tuesday. Sugarloaf’s popularity as a recreation spot has expanded the zoning debate far beyond Fredrick. Both sides have enlisted hundreds to thousands of petitioners to pressure the county to act accordingly. Supporters and opponents presented their petitions to the County Council at the hearing. Advocates of the zoning restrictions said the rules are necessary to preserve local habitats and prevent data center development from encroaching on the area. Frederick County has considered data center development by the Sugarloaf mountain range before, said Steve Black, president of the conservation group Sugarloaf Alliance, which opposes the centers. In November 2019, Amazon approached the state to build data centers. Emails between Amazon and Frederick County’s executive branch obtained by Sugarloaf Alliance through public records requests show the county planned and nearly committed to building data centers on the Sugarloaf range using a floating zone, which would allow the project to supersede Sugarloaf’s zoning restrictions. The plans foundered in 2021 after Amazon and the county failed to come to an agreement on a project timeline. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and the newspaper’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on Amazon’s board. Opponents of zoning restrictions, such as Rocky Mackintosh, who lives on a farm in Adamstown, Md., note the mountain range is already under the county’s harshest zoning designation: resource conservation, which heavily restricts development and regulates habitat maintenance. The current restrictions already limit data center development and other large-scale developments in the region, he said. If the concern is data center development, the solution is easy, he said after the meeting. “Just tell the council you don’t want it.” “This overlay plan is absolutely not wanted,” he said. “There are lots of people here tonight who are for the plan or want to make it stronger. … I ask how many of them live here in our region or own property in our region.” At one point, the crowd heckled Mackintosh. “Okay, I’ve got 30 or 40,” he said, counting the in-person hecklers. He then pointed to a petition with signatures from owners of 153 parcels that he handed to the council. Webster, who also opposes the zoning restrictions, said in an interview Wednesday that the landscape plan could create more years-long bureaucratic messes for Stronghold. “The county is making people’s property vulnerable to people’s fears in the future.” Mackintosh and other zoning opponents said the overlay would set a precedent for the county to infringe on their property rights. “I’m not planning to put a data center in. I don’t care if you tell me I can do one,” said David Parker, 61, who owns a farm on the outskirts of the Sugarloaf acres. “But you shouldn’t tell me I can’t build something on my farm. That is crazy.” The zoning restrictions, he later said, feel as invasive as a homeowners association that restricts minute details of every project. Black disagreed. Because of the existing restrictions at Sugarloaf, there wouldn’t be much change in how Stronghold or other nearby landowners operate, he said. “Well, he can’t guarantee me that,” Parker rebutted. Webster, though, said he could guarantee one thing. “There will not be development on Sugarloaf property or Sugarloaf Mountain.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/14/sugarloaf-public-hearing/,Washington Post,2023-12-14 06:00:00,

Axios  showing that just 20 bills were passed by both chambers and signed into law in 2023. That is by far the fewest for a calendar year in decades. Split control of Washington, a narrow House GOP majority, polarization and infighting among Republicans that culminated in the historic ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have conspired to grind legislationto a halt. But the lack of progress on one issue in particular is inexplicable: Ukraine. The issue epitomizes Congress getting in its own way. Congress has left for the holidays without authorizing new spending for a country that   to keep fending off Russia’s invasion. On the surface, the reasons are evident. Many disproportionately loud House Republicans are wary of continuing to send money, and so the party insists that it be paired with changes to immigration policy. Negotiations are underway and apparently progressing, but not in time to get something done right now.  And later may be too late — the White House says the money will  , and the war already  . This shouldn’t be quite so difficult: The White House is pushing for more money, the leaders of both parties in both chambers have emphasized the need for it, and the House has in the past overwhelmingly supported it. Democrats have been the biggest cheerleaders for supporting Ukraine. On the GOP side, that distinction  , the Senate minority leader. The hang-up, then, was always likeliest to come from the House, where a  . Among them from the early stages of the war was now-House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). But as  , Johnson has mostly objected on grounds that the money wasn’t accountable enough. He has at other points stressed the need to combat Russia’s invasion — sounding much more like the hawks that once dominated the congressional GOP. And after he was elected speaker, Johnson delivered the kind of message that suggested Ukraine aid would indeed be a major emphasis for him. “Now, we can’t allow Vladimir Putin to prevail in Ukraine, because I don’t believe it would stop there. And it would probably encourage and empower China to perhaps make a move on Taiwan,” Johnson told Fox News’s Sean Hannity in late October. “We have these concerns. We’re not going to abandon them.” He also seemed to align himself with McConnell’s “axis of evil” talking point, lumping Russia’s aggression in with China and Iran. “We have such big priorities in this moment right now, Sean. We have Israel being attacked. We have unrest. We have the Ukraine situation we have got to deal with,” Johnson said, also mentioning China, Iran, the economy, the border and fentanyl. Nevertheless, the unease within the House GOP conference led Republicans to demand that the aid be paired with immigration changes, which the Biden White House acceded to. That has opened up its own can of worms, given how difficult it has been for Congress to pass much of anything on immigration in recent decades. But also consider this: Despite the reluctance in the House GOP, every major Ukraine aid vote has received the support of at least 73 percent of the House. That low water mark came in September, when Congress was  . That was significant because only 46 percent of House Republicans voted in favor of the aid, dropping support below half of the conference for the first time. House Republicans have long (if haltingly) operated under what was once known as the “Hastert Rule,” which requires legislation being brought up for votes to have majority support within their own conference. But just before that vote, only 42 percent of House Republicans and 22 percent of the House overall voted for an amendment by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) that would have cut off Ukraine entirely. That suggests that, at least as of three months ago, a clear majority of House Republicans and an overwhelming majority of the House overall saw potential value in continuing to help Ukraine, somehow. Those votes would seem to be available if leaders really wanted to push. In one way, Republicans have scored a potential coup: gaining major concessions on a key issue for them — the border — in exchange for something a large number of them have already supported anyway. But the intermingling of the two issues has also created a great deal of uncertainty and jeopardized the aid. Some  , but others push against it — including the possibility that Republicans might not want to take any ownership of a border situation that currently ranks among President Biden’s biggest liabilities for 2024. The downside of employing   is that you can’t be sure in which direction the wedge will ultimately push. If there’s no grand bargain, the current wrangling would certainly make it more difficult for Johnson and his party to go back to any kind of stand-alone Ukraine measure. The base would howl. And in the end, a major foreign policy goal that leaders including Johnson have pitched as crucial could somehow fail. It could be disastrous for Ukraine. But it would be a fitting coda for this year of Congress.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/20/ukraine-aid-epitomizes-an-increasingly-broken-congress/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 17:04:00,
"When Shohei Ohtani agreed to  , jaws around the baseball industry dropped. Everyone expected Ohtani’s free agent deal to break records. He is a once-in-a-generation player who long seemed destined for a once-in-a-generation contract. But no player had ever secured more than $426.5 million in total value. Ohtani blew that number away. When Shohei Ohtani agreed to  , jaws around the baseball industry dropped. Everyone expected Ohtani’s free agent deal to break records. He is a once-in-a-generation player who long seemed destined for a once-in-a-generation contract. But no player had ever secured more than $426.5 million in total value. Ohtani blew that number away. Then, on Monday, when the Athletic reported that Ohtani’s deal included   — or, put another way, that he would be paid only $2 million annually for the 10 years of the deal — jaws dropped again. More literally, perhaps, fingers dropped onto iPhone keypads as executives from rival teams compared notes on the absurdity. That $700 million figure was not quite what it seemed. Sure, other Dodgers such as Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman have deferred money in their deals. The Nationals   in deals during their best years. They owe Max Scherzer $15 million next year because of it. But this seemed like something else. Ohtani’s camp is making the case that his deal is one of the more unselfish ones in MLB history. What player would agree to be paid a mere $2 million annually so his new team has more cash available to spend on other players? Then again, Ohtani reportedly makes millions in endorsement deals each year. He will have plenty of spending money before the bulk of his deal kicks in. The Dodgers can also say they gave Ohtani the biggest deal in professional sports history — bigger than the one Lionel Messi got from Barcelona — without paying out record money in real time. According to the latest version of the collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the MLB players union, all deferred salaries “must be fully funded by the Club, in an amount equal to the present value of the total deferred compensation obligation, on or before the second July 1 following the championship season in which the deferred compensation is earned.” In other words, the Dodgers will have to set aside the money they will eventually pay Ohtani each year by July 1 to ensure they can pay it to him later. But they need only set aside the present value of the money, not the $68 million he will eventually get, which is somewhere around $45 million, thanks to interest rates. And therein lies the reason that Ohtani’s deal — while still massive and unprecedented — is slightly less astronomical than it feels. The Dodgers will still take a major hit to their payroll for the purposes of competitive balance tax (CBT) calculation. No, they are not taking an annual hit of $70 million, which the total value of the deal suggests they would. Article 16 of the CBA explains that the present value of deferred compensation is used to calculate the average annual value for competitive balance tax purposes. The present value of the deferred money — the amount that, if paid in full now, would grow to $700 million in 10 years with current interest rates — plus the actual value of the $20 million the Dodgers will pay Ohtani in real time for 10 years is roughly $460 million. That number divided by the 10-year duration of the deal yields an average annual value of around $46 million — which is still more than any other player has been paid annually. But it is not nearly as much as it seemed:   and   signed deals with average annual values of $43.3 million each.   averages $40 million annually. By that measure, Ohtani is not quite so out of reach. Speaking of Scherzer, those familiar with Nationals payrolls of the mid-2010s might be wondering: Why did they receive ridicule for their inclusion of deferrals for Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg and in potential deals for Bryce Harper and others if the Dodgers are being considered innovators now? The main difference is scale. When the Nationals signed Scherzer to his seven-year deal, they, too, received a competitive balance tax break. But because interest rates were lower, the break was smaller — his $210 million contract had an estimated value of around $185 million then. It did offer the Nationals more payroll flexibility, both literally and when it came to CBT calculations, because his deal counted for slightly less than the $30 million annually its total value would suggest it would be worth. And the Dodgers, who are among the sport’s biggest spenders year in and year out, have a different relationship to their payroll than the Nationals did. Even though there was precedent for the use of large-scale deferrals to offset present-day costs, Ohtani’s deal nevertheless seized industry conversations Monday evening. But the players union has not taken issue with deferred compensation because of the flexibility it affords players and teams as they try to construct big deals. Ohtani would never have been able to say he got a deal worth $700 million without deferrals. It is in the union’s interest to allow players to structure deals in any way that maximizes value. And while the owners did try to bargain for limits on deferred compensation in the negotiations for the current CBA, they did not get it. The agreement, as currently written, is clear: “There shall be no limitations on either the amount of deferred compensation or the percentage of total compensation attributable to deferred compensation for which a Uniform Player’s Contract may provide.” But to the extent that any rival teams feel frustration with the way the Dodgers structured the deal, multiple executives and league officials speaking on the condition of anonymity suggested that the Ohtani contract is hard to use as a harbinger of things to come for one obvious reason: Very few players, even very good ones, would be willing or able to take $2 million in annual salary on a deal that big. Because Ohtani makes so much money in off-field endorsements, and because he is so desperate to win after six seasons without a postseason appearance with the Los Angeles Angels, he amounts to something of a perfect deferred compensation storm. Perhaps other players will use him as a model. But in his contract, as everywhere else, Ohtani is one of a kind.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/12/shohei-ohtani-deferred-money-explained/,Washington Post,2023-12-12 13:18:00,
"BUENOS AIRES — Moments before the world’s top polo players prepared to compete in the world’s most important polo tournament, the stars from two rival teams lined up on the field on horseback, mallets in hand, to pay homage to a champion. Her name was Dolfina Cuartetera. She was a legend in Argentina’s polo Hall of Fame and winner of the most prestigious awards for horses in the sport. She was as fast as she was agile, as explosive as she was docile, a mare with the stamina and strength to outrun and outlast any other. As her owner, the world-renowned polo player Adolfo Cambiaso, put it: “She was genius; she was Messi, Maradona.” BUENOS AIRES — Moments before the world’s top polo players prepared to compete in the world’s most important polo tournament, the stars from two rival teams lined up on the field on horseback, mallets in hand, to pay homage to a champion. Her name was Dolfina Cuartetera. She was a legend in Argentina’s polo Hall of Fame and winner of the most prestigious awards for horses in the sport. She was as fast as she was agile, as explosive as she was docile, a mare with the stamina and strength to outrun and outlast any other. As her owner, the world-renowned polo player Adolfo Cambiaso, put it: “She was genius; she was Messi, Maradona.” Cuartetera wasn’t at the Argentine polo championship this year. She died in May, at the age of 22. But the four representatives of the defending champion La Dolfina team — including Cambiaso and his son — sat atop horses that looked just like her, with the same rich bay coloring and a splash of white on the nose. The horses from the opposing team resembled her, too. “Cuartetera was the mare that marked Adolfito’s career, the one that made us tremble and thrill in so many finals, the one whose runs and plays remain in everyone’s memory,” the announcer said, “until he decided to multiply her.” “Her clones, and the children of her clones, are present at this moment on the field, on both teams.” This futuristic experiment had its origins in 2006, when Cambiaso’s beloved stallion Aiken Cura limped off the field, and it became clear that the horse was in his final days. The star player had an idea: He asked a veterinarian to save some of Aiken Cura’s skin cells. A decade had passed since the birth of  , the world’s first cloned mammal. Scientists in Italy had   in 2003. And the commercial horse-cloning industry had arrived in the United States. Cambiaso decided to take a gamble. He had a Texas laboratory clone Aiken Cura, and then Cuartetera. What began as an effort to immortalize those champions has now become a massive, multimillion-dollar industry. Argentina’s new president,  , who has four clones of his late dog, recently tapped a prominent cloning expert to head the country’s top public science agency. The possibilities of this experiment — and its long-term risks — are yet to be fully understood. But the extent to which this polo-obsessed nation has already fundamentally transformed the sport and the nature of horse breeding was evident on the field at the Argentine Open in Palermo in late November. As the players and the clones watched a video montage memorializing the late original champion mare, her name flashed across the screen. “Dolfina Cuartetera,” it read. “3 February 2001 — ∞.” When Gabriel Vichera was 30, working in an Argentine lab that had just cloned the first horse in Latin America, he read one day that Cambiaso had auctioned a Cuartetera clone for $800,000. The young scientist saw a business opportunity and pitched it to investors: a company dedicated to cloning horses for Argentine polo. More than a decade later, Vichera said his firm, Kheiron Biotech, clones about 100 horses each year — more than just about any company in the world — including about 10 Cuarteteras. Next year, the company expects to double its output. Although clones are still not permitted in horse racing, top-flight horses sell for upward of  $1 million to the best polo clubs in Argentina, to endurance riders in the Middle East and to show-jumping equestrians around the world. On a recent day in a dimly lit lab, as electronic music blasted from speakers, Vichera peered into a microscope and spun various nobs to control two sets of miniature tweezers. His rolled sleeves exposed tattooed arms: a DNA chain and the words “updating nature,” next to the molecular formulas of horses he cloned. Now he was about to make another one. “Do you see something round on the left?” he asked. “That’s the egg.” Making minuscule movements, he delicately placed DNA material from an existing horse just outside of the egg. Then a colleague used an electric shock to push the material in, setting in motion a new life for an old horse. When Vichera first started cloning horses, about half of those born would suffer a deformity or die. But when he started using stem cells for his cloning procedure, defects and losses became rare. In many ways, it makes sense that this South American nation would become a leader in horse cloning. In addition to its world-famous polo scene, it has permissive regulations, a sophisticated biotechnology sector and extensive farmland. It is also one of the world’s top exporters of horsemeat. To make a clone embryo, scientists need eggs extracted from horse ovaries, and they found plenty in Argentina’s slaughterhouses. Early on, horse cloning was met with skepticism from many in the polo industry and outright horror from others who saw it as a work of science fiction. Ethicists still argue that cloned horses create an uneven playing field in a sport that hinges heavily on a horse’s performance. Competing with cloned horses removes a great deal of room for error, said Francisco Javier López Frías, a sports ethicist at Pennsylvania State University. At what point, he said, does a polo player’s accomplishment become “sort of the laboratory’s accomplishment?” But over the past decade, the entire polo industry has had to get on board. Even one of the main detractors of cloning in Argentine polo — the Ellerstina club — has its own clones. “They were falling behind,” Vichera said. “They saw that it worked.” The eggs from Vichera’s lab are eventually delivered to a farm about an hour away, where they are implanted into surrogate mares. The drive there cuts through Pilar, a Buenos Aires suburb that boasts more than 100 polo grounds. A turn down an unmarked, rural dirt road leads to the Kheiron farm, home to hundreds of pregnant or soon-to-be pregnant horses. One of those horses, “Receptor 1569,” was in her 14th day of gestation, meaning it was time for an ultrasound. There was Cuartetera, the newest clone of the polo legend, moving around in the mare’s uterus. An embryo with champion potential. At another farm just a few minutes away, cloned foals and fillies stuck close to mothers that looked nothing like them. “It’s the nursery,” Vichera said as he walked into a paddock. There was a Cuartetera about 2 months old, another just 3 weeks old. A snapshot of different moments in a horse’s life span, at one farm, all at once. They are not all the same horse. Each of the Cuarteteras have their small distinctions, a result of nature (genes that express themselves more than others) and nurture (experience in utero or in the early years of life). They have subtle differences in temperament. The white marks on their noses are all slightly different, too. But given the right care and training, the clones would almost certainly share traits that made the original such a legend. It used to take breeders hundreds of births to produce a competitive polo horse. Mares are only fertile in the spring, which coincides with the most important polo tournaments of the year, making it difficult for champions to both compete and breed. Instead, when you clone a horse, and then breed from those clones, Vichera said, you are “starting with genetics that you know are elite.” “So you don’t have to have 100 births to find a good animal. You might only need 10,” Vichera said. “You’re not just cloning your horse. You’re cloning your moneymaking factory.” Using embryo transfers, a single horse can now give birth to as many as 10 foals per year, instead of one, said Andres Gambini, a veterinarian and researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia, who was also part of the team of Argentine scientists who cloned the first horse in South America. The sheer volume of today’s cloning operations raises the question: How many clones are too many? “One of the things that you need for genetic progress is genetic variability,” Gambini said. “When you are using cloning and you are staying with the same genetics over and over and over, then the genetic variability starts to decrease.” Long term, if left uncontrolled, this could lead to inbreeding and even fertility problems in horses, Gambini said. Argentina imposes few rules on cloning, and polo association leaders place no restrictions on how many cloned horses can play in a game, leaving it up to the companies and the teams to define their own limits. Vichera and his team have begun combining cloning with gene editing. In mid-December, they successfully implanted seven cloned, genetically modified embryos. If the pregnancies are successful, the world’s first genetically designed horse will be born next year — a horse whose genes have been edited to be stronger and faster, a sort of polo superhorse. If he gets the green light from Argentine regulatory authorities, the scientist hopes to take this technology to the next level — changing the sex of a clone, for breeding purposes or perhaps to make an even better pony. If he were to clone an elite stallion, Vichera wonders, could that same horse be even more powerful as a mare? La Dolfina was trailing behind by a point in the third period of the final match of the Argentine Open, the Dec. 3 match that would determine if the powerhouse team would defend the sport’s most important championship title. As the crowd in the packed stands went silent, Cambiaso’s 18-year-old son, Adolfo “Poroto” Cambiaso — on the back of Cuartetera clone B09 — sent the ball flying up the field. His teammate, David Stirling, knocked it to a perfect opening. The elder Cambiaso seemed to come out of nowhere, on the lightning-fast Cuartetera clone B06, the mare he has often described as the most similar to the original. Together, they made a run for it, racing past all the other horses. The star player struck the ball into the goal to tie up the game. “ , that’s how you play polo,” said an announcer. After a razor-tight final, La Natividad clinched the championship. La Dolfina relinquished its title. But Cambiaso’s experiment saw yet another success. A Cuartetera clone matched the feat of the original. For a third year, the prize for the best horse of the most important tournament in polo went to Cuartetera B06.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/horse-cloning-polo-argentina/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 06:30:00,

Dozens of D.C. residents, business owners and activists on Wednesday sounded off at a hearing on a   introduced last month by Mayor Muriel E.

The well-attended hearing comes as city officials are feeling increased pressure to mitigate trends around crime. While some of the 80 or so people who signed up to testify at the hearing led by D.C. Council member Brooke Pinto (D-Ward 2) criticized aspects of the mayor’s bill, including a rollback of some provisions of major police reform legislation created after George Floyd’s murder and an anti-loitering statute that has raised  , many spoke with a sense of desperation for anything but the status quo. “If we go on the path we are now, with the momentum of violence and crime, we’re in trouble,” said Council member Matthew Frumin (D-Ward 3). “We need to figure out what’s the path that can, frankly, save the city.” The proposal is among a flurry of recent bills aimed at reducing crime that are now being considered by the council (since last November, Pinto noted, D.C. has seen a 40 percent increase in violent crime and a 25 percent increase in property crime). Among its provisions, Bowser’s Addressing Crime Trends Now Amendment Act aims to crack down on open-air drug markets by reviving a decades-old policy that allows police to set up temporary “drug-free zones,” make organized retail theft a felony, and make it illegal to wear a mask for the purpose of committing crimes or causing fear. Some who testified in support of the bill shared stories about friends and family members who have been recent victims of crime or anecdotes about suspected drug activity they say has gone on unabated. Kenyattah Robinson, president of the Mount Vernon Triangle Community Improvement District, said these fears have been exacerbated by inaction on “quality of life” issues that he felt Bowser’s bill could help remedy. “Issues such as being unable to buy basic necessities because organized retail theft has rendered stores shelves bare, to having to navigate open-air drug markets while walking a child from school, to fears of being robbed or carjacked or robbed by masked criminals while enjoying a night out on the town,” Robinson said. “[They] all contribute to a heightened perception that things are out of control.” Longtime resident Keith Hasan-Towery called some aspects of Bowser’s bill “good” but said other components needed more thought. He questioned, for example, whether establishing a five-day, drug-free zone would simply allow illegal activity to proliferate elsewhere. Some others who opposed the drug-free-zone proposal questioned its constitutionality, noting the D.C. Council in 2014, which included Bowser, voted unanimously to repeal a near-identical statute because of due process concerns that had been raised by the American Civil Liberties Union and the office of D.C.’s attorney general. Last month, however, the office of Attorney General Brian Schwalb said the bill was “legally sufficient.” Rondell Jordan, a community defender with the organization Open City Advocates, which provides legal defense for youths after they are sentenced in juvenile court, argued the zones would not make the city safer. “What it will do, is permit officers to target mostly young Black men and boys who are lingering in public spaces which will further erode an officer’s most valuable resource, the trust of a community,” he said. In her testimony Wednesday, Police Chief Pamela A. Smith sought to assuage some concerns about the bill. She noted that officers would need to have “reasonable, articulable suspicion” before conducting a stop in a drug-free zone — such as observing the exchange of money for a small package — and consider whether people have legal justification to be there, such as waiting for the bus. Smith said she was open to codifying other reasons that people might be in the restricted zones, such as residents “coming and going from drug treatment centers.” The proposed adjustments to D.C.'s police accountability legislation was another hotly debated topic Wednesday. As written, the bill would loosen restrictions on vehicular pursuits, narrow the definition of prohibited neck restraints and allow officers to review their body-camera footage before writing a police report (except in cases of officer-involved shootings or serious uses of force). It would eliminate a provision of the policing law requiring the release of officers’ names in disciplinary cases, and it would limit public access to an officer’s disciplinary records if the alleged infraction is not sustained. Smith has said that allowing officers to review body-cam footage ahead of writing a report would help prevent discrepancies in an officer’s accounts that can complicate prosecutions. Smith said other changes were needed to make the department, which has struggled with staffing, more attractive to prospective officers. “I support holding officers accountable for misconduct up to and including termination,” Smith said. “However, we must strive to balance enhanced accountability for officers while acknowledging that they have privacy and safety interests as well.” Katerina Semyonova, special counsel for policy and legislation for the Public Defender Service of the District of Columbia, challenged Smith’s characterization of the changes, calling the bill a “remarkable and cynical departure from where we were less than three years ago when the mayor painted Black Lives Matter on 16th Street.” “Residents want real strategies to reduce violent crime,” she said. “Decreasing police accountability, allowing police to use more neck restraints, displacing and harassing residents who police believe may be engaged in a drug offense from one block to another will do nothing to make the District safer.” That sentiment was shared by Michael Tobin, executive director of D.C.’s Office of Police Complaints, the city’s independent, civilian-led arm for law enforcement oversight. He argued that restricting the release of disciplinary information targeted his office’s authority and would erode public trust in the department. “It’s really shortsighted and imprudent to believe that reducing the authority of my office and eliminating the ability of the public to participate and understand, and see the workings of its own police force will somehow reduce crime and make us safer,” Tobin said. “It’s just a wrong assumption.” Before it is considered by the full council, Bowser’s bill must pass through the council’s judiciary committee, headed by Pinto. At-large Council members Christina Henderson (I) and Anita Bonds (D) noted that crime trends such as increased carjackings have been fueled by juveniles, whom they said have not been a focus of recent legislative proposals. Council member Zachary Parker (D-Ward 5), emphasized the need for a clearer citywide strategy and determining what changes are necessary to boost case closures by D.C. police and prosecutions by the U.S. attorney for the District. But for some who testified, including Ollie Figueroa, an executive with the Chinatown hotel Motto by Hilton, the best path forward is less complicated. “We highly encourage and support any initiative — except inaction,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/29/dc-crime-bill-hearing-carjacking/,Washington Post,2023-11-29 19:55:00,

But should they? Joe Flacco, a 38-year-old who was out of the NFL for much of the season, has   and, as their quarterback by necessity rather than by choice, has their passing game looking more dangerous than it ever did with Watson. That was evident again Sunday when Flacco threw for 368 yards and three touchdowns as the Browns defeated the Texans, 36-22, in Houston. Flacco threw two interceptions, but he was able to get the ball downfield consistently to wide receiver Amari Cooper, who finished with 11 catches for 265 yards and two touchdowns. “What do you think [Browns owner] Jimmy Haslam is thinking seeing Flacco play way better off the couch than Watson has ever played in Cleveland with 3 more fully guaranteed years left on his contract?” former NFL offensive lineman Ross Tucker  . Watson’s five-year deal worth a fully guaranteed $230 million makes it difficult for the Browns to admit a mistake and move on, even if that merely would mean putting Watson on the bench and keeping a less expensive and more productive quarterback such as Flacco on the field. Joe Flacco and Amari Cooper are playing on rookie mode 🤣   It was not supposed to go this well when the Browns signed Flacco, the former Super Bowl MVP for the Baltimore Ravens, to their practice squad last month. Flacco had been unable to attract an offer from the New York Jets or any other quarterback-needy team earlier in the season. He became the fourth Browns starting quarterback of the season following Watson, rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson and PJ Walker. After being plagued by shoulder problems throughout the season, Watson   with the Browns just before his season ended, completing all 14 of his second-half passes during a Nov. 12 triumph in Baltimore. During that game, he suffered a broken bone in his right shoulder that  . Watson has played in just 12 games in his two seasons with the Browns. He served   for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy to begin last season, stemming from   in civil lawsuits filed by more than two dozen women. On the field, he rarely has resembled the quarterback who was a three-time Pro Bowl selection in his first four NFL seasons with the Texans. Joe Flacco & Amari Cooper (75-yd TD) 🔸 Air Distance: 54.1 yds 🔸 Target Separation: 1.0 yds 🔸 Completion Probability: 31.6% Cooper has gained 150 yards on vertical routes off of play action today, the most in a game over the last 5 seasons.  |    If Watson ever could be at his best again for the Browns, he clearly would be their top quarterback. But that’s only relevant if   version of Watson actually appears on the field. Meanwhile, Flacco has led the Browns to three victories in his four starts. They are 10-5 and in the No. 5 playoff seed in the AFC. Flacco has thrown for 1,307 yards in his four games, with 10 touchdown passes and seven interceptions. Flacco’s play probably has earned him a chance next season, whether in Cleveland or elsewhere. It’s debatable whether any team would give him a training-camp opportunity to earn a starting job. But that title is becoming somewhat less significant in the NFL, with so many teams going through two, three or even four starters in a season. The Browns perhaps would be wise to consider how Flacco might fit on their roster next season, even with Watson presumably back. It’s getting close to the point at which there should be no more debate about the Las Vegas Raiders retaining Antonio Pierce as their coach. The Raiders raised their record to 4-3 with Pierce as their interim coach in Monday’s 20-14 triumph over the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. They were 3-5 when Pierce was promoted by owner Mark Davis to  . ""I believe. We believe."" Antonio Pierce's post-game locker room speech is legendary. (via  )  Davis could chase a higher-profile coach, perhaps Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh. He passed over Rich Bisaccia, who led the Raiders to the playoffs in the 2021 season as interim coach following the  . But Davis would be wise to keep Pierce. He will not find a coach who fits in better with the Raiders organization and can connect more effectively with the players. Pierce clearly has the Raiders playing hard and playing with an edge. He beat the Chiefs even with his quarterback, rookie Aidan O’Connell, throwing for just 62 yards on 9-for-21 passing. One of the best teammates in the world… now showing he’s one of the best leaders of men. Do the right thing Mark Davis.   should be the   next head coach!!  Keep going Tat!  Pierce said afterward that his job situation would take care of itself. The Raiders finish the regular season with games against the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos. If they win those two, Pierce’s future should be secure. The Los Angeles Rams mostly have been an afterthought since   to close the 2021 season. That Rams team was not exactly built to last. It was a seize-the-moment, Super Bowl-or-bust enterprise in which Coach Sean McVay and General Manager Les Snead famously surrendered future draft choices to address immediate roster needs. Some key veterans, such as wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and pass rusher Von Miller, moved on. McVay, quarterback Matthew Stafford and defensive tackle Aaron Donald stayed put despite the retirement speculation that surrounded them since. Stafford and wide receiver Cooper Kupp were plagued by injuries last season as the Rams went 5-12. Things weren’t that much more promising this season when the Rams got off to a 3-6 start entering their bye. But, suddenly, they’re back, at least somewhat. They are relevant again in the NFC playoff race. They have gone 5-1 since that 3-6 start, culminating with their 30-22 triumph Thursday night over the New Orleans Saints. Their only defeat during this resurgent stretch came in overtime to the Ravens. ""I think I'm falling in love with Puka Nacua."" Fitz couldn't hide his love for   to Matthew Stafford. 😂   Stafford threw for 328 yards and two touchdowns in the victory over the Saints. He had help from some young players around him. Second-year running back Kyren Williams, a fifth-round pick from Notre Dame, ran for 104 yards and a touchdown. That put him above 1,000 rushing yards for the season. Rookie wideout Puka Nacua, a fifth-round selection this year from BYU, had nine catches for 164 yards and a touchdown to raise his season totals to 96 catches for 1,327 yards and five touchdowns. “It’s one of the more impressive rookie campaigns I’ve ever seen from any player at any position,” Stafford said on the Prime Video postgame set. The Rams (8-7) hold the No. 6 playoff seed in the NFC. The way they’re playing, they could be a dangerous opening-round opponent for any of the conference’s front-runners. “[When] we got all those guys rolling,” Stafford said Thursday, “we’re tough to deal with.” The MVP race may have been settled Monday night in Santa Clara, Calif. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson thoroughly outplayed San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy. The Ravens outclassed the 49ers, 33-19, to establish themselves as the league’s top team. Jackson is the best player on the best team. The choice should be easy, at least for now. “I thought Lamar had an MVP performance tonight,” Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said after the game. “It takes a team to create a performance like that. But it takes a player to play at that level, to play at an MVP level. … Lamar was all over the field, doing everything.” Fred Warner is one of the best linebackers in the NFL I have never seen him look this helpless before Lamar Jackson does that to people  Jackson threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns while adding 45 rushing yards. Purdy suffered through a four-interception nightmare before exiting the game early because of what the 49ers described as a stinger. Jackson was the unanimous MVP of the 2019 season, when the Ravens entered the AFC playoffs as the No. 1 seed but lost a divisional-round game at home to the Tennessee Titans. They’ll have to hope for a better postseason showing this time. Quarterback Baker Mayfield, once   by the Browns’ trade for Watson, may have  . Mayfield, the No. 1 selection in the 2018 draft by the Browns, took a winding path to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Browns traded him   before last season. The Panthers released him, at Mayfield’s request, and he had a successful late-season stint with the Rams before signing with the Buccaneers in March. He won a quarterback competition with Kyle Trask and now is having one of the better seasons of his career. Mayfield has thrown for 3,598 yards and 26 touchdowns with eight interceptions. He is eligible for free agency again this offseason and could secure a solid contract to re-sign with the Buccaneers. Repost to   ‼️     “I would love to be here,” Mayfield said after Sunday’s victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. “It’s a great city, great group of guys, great organization. But winning ballgames takes care of that. So we’ll have that discussion after the year.” The Buccaneers, at 8-7, have a one-game lead in the NFC South. They could win the division for a third straight year in the first season since  . Mayfield has “been outstanding,” Coach Todd Bowles said Sunday. “He’s been outstanding in December. That’s what you want from your quarterback in December. … When you’re trying to make a push and your quarterback is playing great, it gives you a chance.” The Saints were lovable losers before Sean Payton’s arrival in 2006. They have reverted to losing, mostly without the lovable part, since   following the 2021 season. Thursday night’s loss to the Rams dropped the Saints to 7-8. They’re 14-18 as they near the completion of their second season without Payton. Dennis Allen: “We didn’t play the way we needed to play.”    That’s not dreadful. But Payton raised the expectations considerably during his 15 seasons as the Saints’ coach over 16 years. He won 63.1 percent of his regular season games, compiling a record of 152-89, and guided the Saints to the playoffs nine times. They won the Super Bowl in the 2009 season, cementing the once-downtrodden franchise’s status as a rallying point for the community after New Orleans was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Payton and Drew Brees arrived together in 2006 and ended up forming one of the most successful coach-quarterback combinations in NFL history. The Saints promoted Dennis Allen from defensive coordinator to head coach after Payton stepped down following the 2021 season. It remains to be seen whether Saints owner Gayle Benson would allow Allen to remain in place following a second straight non-playoff season. Amazon will complete its second season of being   of the NFL’s Thursday night package with this week’s Jets-Browns game. That matchup might not provide a viewership boost, but the predictions by NFL leaders early in the season that Amazon would show Year 2 improvement in viewership have proved accurate. Thursday night games on Amazon are averaging 11.97 million viewers this season, up 25 percent from last season’s average of 9.57 million. The NFL also is getting the younger demographic that it is seeking. According to Amazon, the average age of the “Thursday Night Football” viewer this season is 48.5. That is 6.9 years younger than the average NFL viewer on linear TV networks and 13.5 years younger than the average NFL prime-time viewer on broadcast TV. It’s been some year on and off the field for the  . Via  , here’s a look at viewership   prior to last night’s game. Averaging a whopping 17.5 million viewers per game.  The NFL has made a commitment to putting its games on streaming platforms. It placed the “NFL Sunday Ticket” package on YouTube this season, and the Bills-Chargers game Saturday night was carried by Peacock. The increase in Amazon viewership this season is part of a strong overall trend for the NFL. The average game this season had drawn 17.5 million viewers across TV and digital platforms through Week 15, up 7 percent from last season. Of the 75 most-viewed shows on TV since the start of the NFL season through Week 15, 72 of them were NFL games. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. The newspaper’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on Amazon’s board.

But some in the league continue to wonder whether Harbaugh will at least explore his NFL options, as he has done in other recent offseasons. The Los Angeles Chargers’ job is vacant and could be attractive, given the presence of quarterback Justin Herbert. The Raiders’ job could be available if they don’t keep Pierce. The Chicago Bears’ job could be alluring to Harbaugh, a former Bears quarterback, if the franchise opts to fire Matt Eberflus. As the NFL's coaching carousel is set to spin,   coach Jim Harbaugh is weighing a huge decision -- whether to accept a massive new contract that includes a ""no NFL"" clause for one year. My story:  Harbaugh already served a suspension handed down by the Big Ten, and his program remains under investigation by the NCAA. It remains possible the NFL   imposed by the NCAA on Harbaugh in the alleged improper scouting and sign-stealing case, based on integrity-of-the-game considerations, people familiar with the deliberations have said. Michigan reportedly also received a notice of allegations from the NCAA related to an investigation of coaching and recruiting during the coronavirus pandemic dead period. The NFL may  . But its competitive balance is intact. Entering Week 17, 24 teams remain in playoff contention. That’s tied for the most with two weeks remaining since there were a record 26 in 2004.

"After decades of effort, a much longed-for economic recovery in the Springfield area of Fairfax County is slowly happening. Workers at the Transportation Security Administration, which located there in 2021, flow in and out of a sprawling parking lot a short distance from the Franconia-Springfield Metro station and the “Mixing Bowl” interchange of Interstates 495, 395 and 95. After decades of effort, a much longed-for economic recovery in the Springfield area of Fairfax County is slowly happening. Workers at the Transportation Security Administration, which located there in 2021, flow in and out of a sprawling parking lot a short distance from the Franconia-Springfield Metro station and the “Mixing Bowl” interchange of Interstates 495, 395 and 95. Nearby, restaurants at the recently renovated Springfield Town Center mall offer cheerful outdoor patios, a Target bustles with shoppers and a giant Lego sculpture of a giraffe at the mall’s entrance towers near a Lego Discovery amusement center that has become a weekend draw for families. Plans for a boutique hotel and a 400-unit multifamily residential complex are also underway at the town center property and, less than a mile away, Amazon Web Services is constructing a new data center. On a separate site, the Inova Hospital System is preparing to build a new campus with a 120-bed hospital and medical offices near its existing Franconia-Springfield Healthplex outpatient facility — scheduled to open in 2028. But the future remains uncertain for a 58-acre site owned by the General Service Administration, which has long been a local eyesore. Jeffrey C. McKay (D), chair of Fairfax County’s Board of Supervisors, said he didn’t understand why the GSA would allow the Springfield property to remain a hub of mostly warehouses housing old office equipment and other federal property while the area around it shows signs of a revival. “It’s the epitome of dumb growth,” McKay said. “Everybody looks at it and says, ‘Why is that there?’” And while state and local officials had hoped the federal property would be the future location of the FBI’s main offices — bringing with it an infusion of jobs and several billions of dollars in tax revenue — the GSA last month selected Maryland’s Prince George’s County instead, leaving Virginia officials soured and uncertain about the site’s future. The GSA has not said what it plans to do with the Springfield site. Last week, the agency’s acting inspector general said his office will   how the selection was made, a response to   by most of Virginia’s congressional delegation that the outcome was inappropriately influenced by political considerations. The delegation said in a joint letter that a three-member panel convened by the agency had unanimously recommended the Springfield site — also preferred by FBI officials — before a former official who had been placed in charge of the selection process the following month made changes to how the sites were scored that benefited the Greenbelt site. Maryland officials — arguing that the decision was based on merit, bringing more equity to an often overlooked county — said the allegations of political meddling by Virginia’s congressional delegation are unwarranted. The GSA said it welcomes a review of its findings. Fairfax officials said moving the FBI to Springfield would have helped bring the once solidly middle-class area back to prosperity after poverty and crime seeped in. Anchored by the former Springfield Mall, the community was once a destination for shoppers and middle-income professionals in search of starter homes. Princess Diana and then-Prince Charles even visited the mall during their 1985 U.S. tour, bringing glamour to the community of leafy streets and brick bungalow houses. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the mall fell into disrepair and, in the parking lot, car break-ins and carjackings became a regular worry — part of a slide that accelerated after the 2008 recession led to a wave of home foreclosures in the area. Fairfax Supervisor Rodney L. Lusk (D-Franconia) said the county magisterial district that includes Springfield is now a majority-minority community, with nearly 20 percent of its 130,000 residents earning below $50,000 per year and nearly 43 percent earn less than $100,000 per year. The area has also been medically underserved, factoring into Inova’s decision to expand its presence there. The outpatient center is busy with emergency room cases and often does not have the capacity to treat particular ailments, said H. Thomas McDuffie Jr., president of Inova Realty. “There’s a tremendous need there for more facilities and to take pressures off of having to move patients to other hospitals,” he said. Virginia officials highlighted the area’s struggles to the GSA after it   in July to give more weight to how it reflects the Biden administration’s commitment to economic and racial equity. Lusk said local residents who have received training in welding, carpentry or electrical wiring through a county workforce development program in the Hybla Valley portion of his district would be great candidates for the hundreds of construction jobs created by an FBI relocation to Springfield. “I felt like we have a case for equity, too,” Lusk said. The FBI headquarters was just the latest in a string of other proposed federal agency relocations to the site that never materialized, including the TSA, which found the site unsuitable for its needs and decided on its current home, Fairfax officials said. “In every federal relocation that’s happened over the past 10 years, this site had been on the shortlist of opportunities,” said McKay, who keeps in his cellphone a 2013 photograph of him talking at a lectern about the potential for the FBI to move to Springfield. Some of the other elected officials in that picture — including former Reps. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.), Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.) and James P. Moran Jr. (D-Va.) — are no longer in public office. “That’s how old this is,” McKay said about the effort to redevelop the site. “I’ve been working on it for 14 years.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/24/fairfax-virginia-springfield-fbi-headquarters-economic-development/,Washington Post,2023-12-04 07:00:00,

In contrast to AI tools built by OpenAI, Microsoft and Google, which are trained to tread lightly around controversial topics, Musk’s would be edgy, unfiltered and anti-“woke,” meaning it wouldn’t hesitate to give politically incorrect responses. That’s turning out to be trickier than he thought. Two weeks after the Dec. 8 launch of Grok to paid subscribers of X, formerly Twitter, Musk is fielding complaints from the political right that the chatbot gives liberal responses to questions about diversity programs, transgender rights and inequality. “I’ve been using Grok as well as ChatGPT a lot as research assistants,”  , the socially conservative psychologist and YouTube personality, Wednesday. The former is “near as woke as the latter,” he said.

This is just the beta.” Grok is the first commercial product from xAI, the  .

In the past year, the rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI chatbots and image generators has sparked debate over how they represent minority groups or respond to prompts about politics and culture-war issues such as race and gender identity.

Earlier this month, a post on X of a chart showing one of Rozado’s findings drew a response from Musk. While the chart “exaggerates the situation,” Musk said, “we are taking immediate action to shift Grok closer to politically neutral.” (Rozado agreed the chart in question shows Grok to be further left than the results of some other tests he has conducted.)

General Manager Mike Thibault said Wednesday’s procedure was a success and the team is optimistic she will make a full return. He declined to say when the team knew the strain became a tear. “We’ve known the general gist of the injury from the start,” Thibault said, “but in talking to the hip specialists at the time, there was no reason to act rashly about it. We just took a timely, conservative approach. We eventually just shut her down completely, and then the doctors wanted to wait and see how she did after the season.” The 6-foot-5 Austin,  , averaged 10.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 0.9 blocks in 2023 — all career highs. “I’m just trying to figure what’s best for me moving forward and continue to make the right decisions for my career,” Austin said after the season ended. “I was on a pretty good run, if I must say. I was feeling really good, confident in myself, and I was figuring stuff out. So for me, I still have a lot to prove.” The Phoenix Mercury announced that Kristi Toliver, whose 14-year WNBA playing career includes four seasons with the Mystics (over two tours), will become an associate head coach. Toliver, 36, tore her ACL while playing with the Mystics in September and was likely to miss the upcoming season while recovering. Though she has not announced her retirement, WNBA rules preclude players from also serving on coaching staffs. A person with knowledge of Toliver’s thinking said she intends to retire. Toliver, who was part of Maryland’s 2006 national championship team, also won two WNBA titles — one with Los Angeles in 2016 and one with the Mystics in 2019. She ranks seventh on the all-time WNBA list for career three-point field goals with 651 and 19th in career assists with 1,300. The Mercury named former NBA and G League assistant Nate Tibbetts head coach in October. Toliver has also served two stints working as an NBA assistant — with the Wizards from 2018 to 2020 and the Mavericks from 2021 to 2023. “I'm thrilled for her,” Thibault said. “This is a chance to go to a situation where I think she'll be leaned upon for her knowledge of the league. The fact that she has coached at the NBA level for two different teams and played for three different teams in the WNBA kind of gives her a broad perspective on how things can work, what should work. “I think that she’ll be a great resource for Nate acclimating himself to the W because she’s experienced every part of it.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/01/mystics-shakira-austin-kristi-toliver/,Washington Post,2023-12-01 17:57:00,
"The College Football Playoff’s four-team format will go to an early grave after next month’s championship game, when the sport finally will embrace a logical, 12-team format starting with the 2024 season. The epitaph of this setup was written weeks ago,   by the SEC’s Tammany Hall-esque machinations, laying bare the fundamental silliness of allowing only four teams into the playoff field during an era in which five power conferences (plus Notre Dame) defined the sport. The College Football Playoff’s four-team format will go to an early grave after next month’s championship game, when the sport finally will embrace a logical, 12-team format starting with the 2024 season.

The   because the major bowl games never really relinquished their unearned control of the sport’s postseason and refused to allow more than four teams into a bracket when the format debuted in 2014. (If you’re ever in doubt about who’s at fault in college football come January, blame the Rose Bowl.) Florida State’s snub in favor of one-loss Alabama is a byproduct of an ungovernable sport’s greed growing in dangerously lopsided directions. It’s sort of a shame (although justifiable) that the four-team format will be defined by its omission of a team because the schools that will play in Monday’s semifinals are steeped in narrative during a season in which the   in American sports. All of these programs are stories in their own right, and together they represent the successes and failures of college football’s first playoff era. There is no reality in which Michigan hoists its first national championship since 1997 absent the asterisk of cheating. From a pure football standpoint, such a caveat is entirely unfair. That’s not just my own opinion. It’s the consensus I built from a network of coaches, all with varying degrees of dirty hands from the same types of gray-area gamesmanship. Not only is signal-stealing ubiquitous, its efficacy is debatable. For most of the playoff era, Michigan was a non-factor while programs such as its Rose Bowl opponent, Alabama, and archrival Ohio State flourished. Of course, Michigan fans chose to blame their also-ran purgatory on the sport’s moral rot rather than the actual culprit: their own alumnus-inbred mismanagement, from Dave Brandon to Warde Manuel to Brady Hoke to even Jim Harbaugh, at least the one who couldn’t beat the Buckeyes. There is no explanation for Michigan’s years of mediocrity beyond its management of players and coaches and resources. The Wolverines lacked in all these areas despite boasting the access, money and prestige necessary to compete with similar brands. But then Harbaugh became another version of himself, a Michigan Man still with Michigan standards intact and yet competent enough to smack down the sport’s Pharisees: a Harbaugh who could steamroll Ohio State in Columbus and this season a Harbaugh so efficient he could delegate nearly a month of nonconference games to assistant coaches during his suspension with no noticeable deficiencies. It’s a minor tragedy we didn’t spend this fall analyzing the refinements and solutions Harbaugh implemented to elevate this program from a Big Ten also-ran into a 38-3, three-time conference champion since 2021. Nothing revealed to date in the   reveals a smoking gun with enough caliber to credulously advantage the Wolverines more than their own talent or scheme. Simply put, Michigan was good enough to win without whatever Stalions obtained and regardless of who in the organization knew it was happening. But as unfair as the cheater label might be, Michigan has earned it. By his own admission,  , a man with an actual manifesto, a human being so warped by Michigan’s cultural rhetoric he enrolled in the Naval Academy as a part of a larger plan to one day help … Michigan football. One day the NCAA might determine Stalions’s actions to be entirely his own, but his ideology — and therefore his motive to conduct a national surveillance campaign — springs directly and ironically from the “It’s hard to beat the cheaters” pablum Harbaugh and Michigan supporters have suffocated the narrative with for decades. Michigan is an exceptional football team, and it arguably performed as the nation’s best during a regular season fraught with distractions internal and otherwise. But the culture of bunk moral superiority it has long espoused carries a consequence: It’s responsible for why the Wolverines will be forced to share a national title with the ignominy of earning it like any of the other playoff-era champions they denounced: by being another cheater. The Crimson Tide is inevitable. It is the blueprint. If you love what college football has become, you owe it to Alabama. If you hate it, you can point in the same direction. With three national titles during the preceding Bowl Championship Series era, Nick Saban’s machine was well in progress before the advent of the playoff, and it rolled right through the playoff era, too: The Tide boasts six national title game appearances, three championships and nine total playoff wins (including seven by double digits). For a decade, Alabama has suffocated the idea of another standard, be it by outlasting momentary surges from programs such as LSU or a competing dynasty such as Clemson, which is now scrambling to maintain a portion of the longevity Alabama has enjoyed. Another national title from the Tide would also bookend and rebuke the back-to-back mini-dynasty former Alabama coordinator Kirby Smart built at Georgia, arguably the greatest current threat to its reign. Scores of teams have attempted to replicate this program, and a few have even beaten it when it mattered most. But none has broken Alabama. Many books have already attempted to pinpoint the how of the Saban era’s unbridled success. The shortest explanation is that Saban is a machine that kills uncertainty: Before he took the reins of a distressed historic power in 2007, college football was defined by a variance that seemed intractable: The players are students, so talent comes and goes. So, too, will the help because good assistant coaches will always be poached to become head coaches elsewhere. Boosters have outsize influence and will inevitably meddle. All in all, there is a season to success, and fortunes wane. Saban stamped that idea out. And as it produced previously unseen title-caliber consistency, his ruthless micromanagement became a dogma and ultimately a religion. Right before the playoff era, in 2013, Texas tried to lure Saban out of Tuscaloosa with a then-staggering $100 million contract. Saban’s decision to stand pat became the defining moment of modern college football, and the standard for the playoff era was set. Another Alabama championship would seem to prove that standard is the only one capable of delivering in perpetuity. If money solved all problems, Texas would be a utopia. So, too, would its flagship university, defined in the playoff era by the lack of success its seemingly infinite advantages could not prevent. In January 2019, I spoke to a then-Texas assistant weeks after the Longhorns beat Georgia in the Sugar Bowl to cap their first 10-win season since 2009. Assuming all was positive in Austin and the program was finally shaking off its torpor of inefficiency, I was shocked to hear his assessment of the offseason: “It’s impossible to stop the noise around these kids. It’s impossible to keep a team culture here with so much on the outside convincing them they’re great for no reason.” No football program, at least no football program of privileged means, was more associated during the playoff era with unearned entitlement and physical “softness” than Texas. The former is that classic saw of “too many cooks” in the gilded Texas booster class. The latter is hard to qualify, but it was a common refrain among opposing coaches: Under a few very different head coaches, Texas did the same thing: recruited five-star talent you could hit in the mouth once and never worry about again. The unfortunate truth about football is that it’s a violent occupation that requires more than our society’s acceptable standards of commitment or tenacity. Long cursed by their own “We’re Texas” culture, the Longhorns finished 5-7 in Coach Steve Sarkisian’s 2021 debut, then 8-5 last season, and now they are 12-1 entering the Sugar Bowl against Washington. What’s different from previous upswings in Texas history is the manner in which the Longhorns ascended: Even a casual fan can’t help but notice Texas’s ferocity. A program universally considered pillow-soft by rivals now seeks out contact, wins ugly games in ugly ways and operates with physicality as a standard and finesse an afterthought. If it seems suspiciously like the Alabama program it beat in September, that’s the design, although the architect is still unlikely. Yes, Sarkisian is a former Alabama assistant and possibly the greatest example yet of Saban’s signature ability to hire failed head coaches and rehabilitate them. Sarkisian imploded at Southern California in 2015 and worked his way back up, but of the Saban tree graduates, no one expected an otherwise mild-mannered “West Coast guy” to be the one to finally seal off the echo chamber in Austin and deliver a product worthy of the resources. The Huskies are the most of-the-moment program in the national title picture:  , a transfer quarterback and a seemingly fearless offensive scheme from coordinator Ryan Grubb are the highlights of Coach Kalen DeBoer’s lightning-fast renovation after the Huskies’ ill-fated succession plan between longtime coach Chris Pedersen and initial replacement Jimmy Lake. If you’re looking for objectively fun football, Washington is arguably the most entertaining team in the sport. Too bad the Huskies showed up two years too late to maybe keep the Pac-12 respectable and in turn keep college football a healthy, thriving sport in every time zone. As it stands, the last Pac-12 season in existence could end with the one thing the league so desperately needed to justify its mismanaged modern identity in the playoff years — a national title-winning program. Football results weren’t what doomed the Pac-12, and the idea one great season from one great team would have changed a historically bungled outfit is foolish. Still, it’s hard to watch a season in which Oregon and Washington dominated the playoff conversation months after they fled to the Big Ten (effective next season). None of this is Washington’s problem now. The Huskies haven’t been this exciting since 1991, so who cares if the neighborhood’s burning? Washington didn’t hire former Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott to run the league into the ground, nor was it obligated to go down with Scott successor George Kliavkoff’s ship. If anything, Washington’s presence in the playoff is something of a miracle considering the obstacles placed in front of Pac-12 programs first by the league itself and then by a cabal of TV executives fattening inventory. Seattle isn’t close to Alabama or Texas or Atlanta or any of the markets that historically dominate in TV ratings or produce future recruits. The league’s stupidly conceived, entirely self-managed network was virtually shut out of carriers, meaning the Huskies and their ilk struggled to market their games nationwide while partnerships such as the Big Ten and Fox and the SEC and ESPN created the current billionaire’s stranglehold of the “Big Two.” And yet the Huskies reached the game’s biggest stage by hiring a great coach and wooing an electric quarterback in Michael Penix Jr. — and also by slyly sneaking out the back door of the crumbling Pac-12 for the certainty of the Big Ten. Whether it matters in any on-field way that they’re not playing Oregon State and Cal in favor of Purdue and Michigan State will be difficult to gauge, at least for a while. Whether the dissection of the Pacific time zone by television executives puppeteering conference realignment damages West Coast football in a measurable way is hard to predict. How it helps college football or college sports in any way other than TV revenue is impossible to figure. But those aren’t Washington’s problems. Hoisting a national championship is a great salve for survivor’s guilt, and it should help with the flights to Indiana and New Jersey, too.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/28/college-football-playoff-storylines/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 19:16:00,
"November was for experimentation. Christmas will follow a more familiar script.

November was for experimentation. Christmas will follow a more familiar script. After   by launching a sprawling in-season tournament, the NBA kept it simple for its holiday showcase by building its five-game slate around its signature rivalry, its biggest stars and its most proven teams as it goes head-to-head with an NFL tripleheader Monday. No surprise invites were extended when the Christmas  , meaning upstarts such as the  , Oklahoma City Thunder and Orlando Magic will be watching from home. So, too, will  , who   and the Los Angeles Clippers, who have caught fire in recent weeks after   in October.   also must wait for his first chance on the Christmas stage, though that’s probably for the best after his rebuilding San Antonio Spurs recently endured an 18-game losing streak. With those snubs acknowledged, here’s a viewer’s guide to the cookie-cutter quintuple-header, which will be broadcast on ABC and ESPN. The Knicks, long plagued by cries that they shouldn’t be gifted a Christmas spot simply because of Madison Square Garden’s charms, have earned the recognition by following up their first playoff series victory in a decade with a steady start. Much of the credit belongs to Jalen Brunson, who scored a career-high 50 points against the Phoenix Suns this month and diced up the Bucks’ weak perimeter defense for 45 points in a narrow loss Nov. 3. The sixth-year guard is averaging a career-high 25.6 points and  , leading Suns star Kevin Durant to say recently that Brunson is a “Hall of Fame player if he keeps it up.” While that talk is premature, the Springfield, Mass.-bound duo of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard lit up the Knicks during a 146-122 victory Dec. 5 that earned the Bucks a trip to the in-season tournament semifinals. Despite a new coach and an adjustment to the blockbuster addition of Lillard, Milwaukee has staked a spot near the top of the East standings and raced out of the gate with a third-ranked offense that ran up a 130-111 blowout win over New York on Saturday. Brace for more fireworks: Lillard has played on Christmas only once during his 12-year career, and he requested to be traded by the Portland Trail Blazers last summer for the chance to shine in big moments such as this.  This matchup is worth checking out, but hit the eject button if New York, which will be without injured center Mitchell Robinson, can’t stop an Antetokounmpo dunk onslaught. Better games are coming. A matchup of the past two NBA champions led by multi-time MVPs Stephen Curry and Nikola Jokic should be all fun and games, right? Think again. The Warriors have fallen hard since their 2022 title:   following repeated acts of unsportsmanlike conduct, and Klay Thompson and Andrew Wiggins are playing far below their championship standard. Golden State is riding a five-game winning streak thanks to quality contributions from rookies Brandin Podziemski and Trayce Jackson-Davis, but it can’t dream about getting back into the title picture until it pulls itself out of the West’s play-in field. Meanwhile, Denver backed up its 2023 title by charging out of the gate with an 8-1 start, only to start wobbling once it lost Jamal Murray to a hamstring injury in November. After Denver slogged through a forgettable 9-9 stretch, Murray’s return helped the Nuggets reclaim some momentum in the run-up to the holiday. Even so, their vaunted offense hasn’t hit top gear, and their reshaped bench continues to work out the kinks. This won’t be a true rematch of Golden State’s 2022 first-round victory over Denver; Green played a central role in defending Jokic, and Murray missed out because of a knee injury. Instead, view this contest as a litmus test for Denver’s repeat chances. Can the Nuggets re-create the frenzied home-court advantage they enjoyed during last year’s playoffs, or will Curry find a way to spoil the party? Gather ’round the big screen. Curry and Jokic remain the NBA’s most entertaining players, and their teams’ bigger-picture questions add to the intrigue. The gold standard for NBA rivalries has produced 12 Finals showdowns, but this will be just the fifth time the Celtics and Lakers have done battle on Christmas. Yet their rare holiday meetings have featured generations of icons: George Mikan’s Minneapolis Lakers beat Bob Cousy’s Celtics in 1951; Cousy got revenge in 1955; Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain led the Lakers past John Havlicek in 1970; and Kobe Bryant’s Lakers knocked off Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and the defending champion Celtics in 2008. Now LeBron James and Jayson Tatum will take their turns carrying the mantle in the day’s premier matchup. The 38-year-old James raised his game during the in-season tournament, claiming MVP honors by  . For his part, Tatum has moved past recent playoff heartbreaks to lead the loaded Celtics to the East’s best record at 22-6. There’s no guarantee this game will be pretty, and their most recent matchup in January was consumed by  . Both teams boast excellent defenses when they’re at full strength: Lakers center Anthony Davis deserves consideration for defensive player of the year honors, and the Celtics have size, length and experience at every position. The spotlight should shine directly on Boston center Kristaps Porzingis, who must prove he can be a game changer in high-stakes affairs. Must-see TV. It has been 15 years since the Celtics and Lakers have had the chance to ruin each other’s holiday. The sputtering Lakers, who are 2-5 since their tournament title, need a win and should enjoy a boost from a full contingent of celebrities at Crypto.com Arena. Storylines abound between these Eastern Conference powers thanks to Jimmy Butler, who left Philadelphia for Miami in 2019 and knocked out his former team in the second round of the 2022 playoffs. Butler’s departure was franchise-altering for both teams: The Heat made the Finals in 2020 and 2023, while Joel Embiid’s 76ers have endured injuries, superstar holdouts and playoff flameouts. Yet hope is back in Philadelphia, which has thrived in the aftermath of the Harden trade. Embiid, the reigning MVP, is leading the NBA in scoring for the third straight year at a career-high 35.0 points, and guard Tyrese Maxey has emerged as an all-star candidate in Harden’s absence. The ball movement, pace and vibes have improved, and Philadelphia has compiled a league-best plus-11.5 net rating by toasting its friendly early-season schedule under new coach Nick Nurse. Heat center Bam Adebayo returned last week from a lengthy hip injury, but unfortunately Embiid was a late scratch from this high-profile matchup with an ankle sprain. To make matters worse, Butler was ruled out in the hours before tip-off with a calf strain. Miami has plugged along thanks to a well-balanced attack and typically gritty play, and it has won eight straight games on Christmas dating from 2009. Verdict: The absences of Embiid and Butler qualify as a major buzzkill, and this one could get choppy like the 2022 playoff series. Pivot back to family time, bust out the board games, and catch the highlights — and possible confrontations — online later. The nightcap was an easy but inspired choice: The Mavericks and Suns present a potent mix of bad blood, star power and new faces. Luka Doncic and Devin Booker haven’t gotten along for years, and the Mavericks’ second-round victory in the 2022 playoffs plunged the Suns into a multiyear identity crisis. Then   and   before last year’s trade deadline, setting up the former Brooklyn Nets teammates for a buzzy Christmas reunion. If that’s not all, the Mavericks enter the holiday with one of the West’s best records, flush with confidence after a demoralizing tank job to close last season. Phoenix, on the other hand, has languished near .500 because its   hasn’t paid dividends, with the star guard playing just six games because of injuries. The Suns need to start stacking wins soon, and Doncic would love nothing more than to kick them while they’re down. Prepare for a shootout: Both teams have below-average defenses and lack elite options to deploy against the other’s stars. Doncic and Durant rank among the NBA’s top three scorers, while Booker isn’t far behind at 27.7 points per game. The only hang-up is Irving, who will be out with a right heel injury he suffered Dec. 8. Still, there are enough elite shot-makers on hand for this to feel like an All-Star Game. The true fans who stay up late will be rewarded with pretty hoops and hard feelings. No one wants to go back to work Tuesday anyway.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/25/nba-christmas-day-games/,Washington Post,2023-12-25 16:17:00,
", a proposed new soccer competition featuring Europe’s elite club teams that would rival the long-standing Champions League, received new life Thursday when the European Union’s top court ruled that UEFA and FIFA — the governing bodies of European and global soccer — broke European competition laws when it prohibited teams from joining the new league. , a proposed new soccer competition featuring Europe’s elite club teams that would rival the long-standing Champions League, received new life Thursday when the European Union’s top court ruled that UEFA and FIFA — the governing bodies of European and global soccer — broke European competition laws when it prohibited teams from joining the new league. In April 2021, 12 of Europe’s wealthiest club soccer teams announced the formation of the Super League, a new 20-team competition to determine the continent’s annual professional champion. Those 12 teams — AC Milan, Arsenal, Atlético Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur — plus three others would have been permanent Super League members, with the other five changing annually based on achievements from the previous season. This differed from the Champions League, which requires all teams to qualify on an annual basis. With reported backing from U.S.-based investment bank JPMorgan Chase, among others, the new league also would have paid its teams hundreds of millions of dollars more than the Champions League. The Super League was met with immediate backlash from nearly all of European soccer, with fans decrying its American-style closed concept. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin called the 12 breakaway teams   and said they were spitting “in the face of football lovers,” and Europe’s governing body banned the 12 teams from UEFA competitions, even if the Super League never got off the ground (the bans were never enforced because of the ensuing legal action). In the face of such opposition, the Super League concept seemingly collapsed within days of its unveiling, with all six of its English participants plus three others backing out. But the Super League’s remaining supporters — namely Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italy’s Juventus — pressed on,   the European Court of Justice to rule on whether FIFA’s and UEFA’s rules about the establishment of new competitions violated European law. Thursday’s ruling found that FIFA and UEFA rules were not “transparent, objective, non-discriminatory and proportionate” and deemed the punishment of the proposed Super League teams “unlawful.” However, the court also ruled that its decision “does not mean that a competition such as the Super League project must necessarily be approved.” Nonetheless, A22 Sports Management — the Madrid-based company hired by the remaining Super League hopefuls to promote the prospective competition —   a new Super League proposal for both men’s and women’s soccer almost immediately after Thursday’s ruling. The men’s portion would feature 64 teams spread over three divisions, with no permanent members and qualification based on performance. The women’s side of the competition would feature 32 teams over two divisions. “We have won the right to compete. European club football is free,” A22 CEO Bernd Reichart said in a statement announcing the new Super League. “The near-70-year UEFA monopoly is finally over, and the Court’s decision has far-ranging and positive consequences for football. We will continue working with clubs, leagues and other stakeholders without fear of sanctions to create the best and most fan-centric football competitions in Europe. Critically we will maintain our commitment to domestic leagues and the football pyramid, and for the first time since 1955, pan-European competitions can now be governed by the participating clubs themselves as is the case in virtually all European domestic leagues.” In its own statement, UEFA said that “the ruling does not signify an endorsement of the so-called ‘super league’ ” and that it already had amended its rules about new competitions to comply with European law. “UEFA remains resolute in its commitment to uphold the European football pyramid, ensuring that it continues to serve the broader interests of society,” the statement said. “We will continue to shape the European sports model collectively with national associations, leagues, clubs, fans, players, coaches, EU institutions, governments and partners alike.” The Super League’s prospects remain dim, at least in terms of the scope hoped for by its supporters.  , English Premier League owners agreed in a new charter that they would “not engage in the creation of new competition formats outside of the Premier League’s rules,” and any league that did not feature England’s top clubs would not attract the attention — or the financial backing — Super League supporters are seeking “While the corpse might continue to twitch in the European courts, no English side will be joining,” Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Association,   in a statement. “The incoming independent regulator will block any club from competing in domestic competition if they join a breakaway super league. Success must be earned on the pitch, not stitched-up in boardrooms.” The DFL, which operates the top two leagues in Germany,   in a statement that it “rejects competitions outside of those organized by the associations and leagues.” Javier Tebas, president of La Liga in Spain, accused Reichart of behaving as if he had been drinking   and   there “won’t be a Super League in two years, or six, or eight,” even if the top two teams in his league — Real Madrid and Barcelona — remain committed to the Super League idea.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/21/super-league-ruling/,Washington Post,2023-12-21 09:50:00,

"The absolutely dreadful Washington Wizards managed their fourth win in 24 games Friday night, and if this season didn’t already feel like a slog, well, now there’s a dark lining to it all. Maybe, in five years, the Wizards will have pulled themselves from their status as permanent stakeholders in the NBA draft lottery. But even if they do, their trudge to relevance — to mere competence, even — is colored by their impending move to a new arena in Northern Virginia. The absolutely dreadful Washington Wizards managed their fourth win in 24 games Friday night, and if this season didn’t already feel like a slog, well, now there’s a dark lining to it all. Maybe, in five years, the Wizards will have pulled themselves from their status as permanent stakeholders in the NBA draft lottery. But even if they do, their trudge to relevance — to mere competence, even — is colored by their impending move to a new arena in Northern Virginia. What will the next five years look like — what will they   like — for the Wizards and their hockey brethren, the Capitals? Ted Leonsis, the founder of the parent Monumental Sports & Entertainment that owns both teams, wants to move them to Alexandria.   that happens — and it says here that remains a big “if” — it won’t be until 2028 at the earliest. That’s a long time to wander in the wilderness — or, in this case, to scurry through the District’s streets, in danger of passing more vacant storefronts than restaurants filled with loyal and hopeful fans. The news of Leonsis’s intention to move his top tenants from downtown in the nation’s capital to a strip of land in the suburbs — where he can develop his own $2 billion self-sustaining city that, in theory, would support those teams — still feels jarring. There are a lot of emotions to sort through, and that doesn’t even get to the finances, which are nothing short of staggering. According to reporting by several of my Washington Post colleagues,   — make sure you’re sitting down before you read this —   in state and local funds. That, my colleagues report, is a record total for one of these projects. So the idea that this is a done deal is beyond premature. This is a start, nothing more. There are no rubber stamps on $1.35 billion in public funds. Let the discussion — and the dissection — begin. The potential move is going to define the Wizards and the Capitals until it happens, and Leonsis’s legacy as a civic-minded sports owner will be determined by whether a new facility brings a region together rather than rips it apart. In the days since the plans were first reported, it certainly feels like the latter. But there’s time. The arena, though, shouldn’t be a distraction from the competitive state of Leonsis’s teams. Say whatever you want about the increase in crime in the neighborhood around Capital One Arena. The crime is on the court, too, and who wants to go see this disjointed 4-20 outfit? Yes, the Wizards are at the beginning of a full-on reboot, and plenty of people believe in new president Michael Winger as a builder. There may well be better days ahead. But the Wizards’ record with Leonis as owner stinks — and not just this season. Since he took over majority ownership in the team before the 2010-11 season, Washington ranks 24th of the 30 NBA franchises in winning percentage. The Wizards have missed the playoffs in eight of 13 seasons and will do so again this season. They have posted a .500 or worse record nine times and will do so again this season. They have never advanced to the Eastern Conference finals, nor have they been even a mild threat to win a title. So when Leonsis said at Wednesday’s announcement, “That is the higher calling on everything that we do — to build these legacies through winning championships from doing the right things in the right way by our fans,”  it’s laughable. There is no taking away the 2018 Stanley Cup from Leonsis’s Capitals, and that title was earned by a collection of players who had been knocking on the door before finally kicking it down. It was thrilling, and it changed how Washington felt as a sports town. The results since — no playoff series wins and a murky transition ahead from the Alex Ovechkin era to whatever lies beyond — haven’t been encouraging. So the key to the success of any sports arena isn’t the arena itself but the inhabitants and whether they win or lose. That’s true whether the teams play in the District or in Alexandria or on the moon. Deliver “championships” — plural, as Leonsis said — and your legacy will be secure in some eyes even if Chinatown doesn’t recapture the vibrancy Abe Pollin brought there. The gap between the announcement of the deal and its potential execution has tentacles that affect not only the teams but the towns and leaders across the region. Already, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) looks as if her administration was caught napping while Leonsis was negotiating with Virginia. Yes, the District has been in discussions on improvements to Capital One Arena for two years, and yes, Sunday’s offer wasn’t their first. It still seems as though getting to the “best and final” offer of $500 million could have come earlier, heading off a clear and present danger. Publicly, this felt reactive, not proactive. So there is fallout. Bowser has openly courted the local NFL team, and Monumental’s proposed move comes at a time when the Commanders and their new owners are scouting for a new stadium site. Here are the mayor’s options: Land the football team for the District and be regarded — among some die-hards — as a hero because of it, or fail to land the football team and be the mayor who watched the basketball and hockey teams walk and couldn’t get the football team to come back. That’s not a great dynamic. There is and will be a debate about what, if any, public money should be contributed to a new Commanders stadium regardless of whether it’s built in the District, Maryland or Virginia. There’s pressure on the mayor, which isn’t a strong starting point. Even the impression that one of the leaders trying to broker a deal is compromised leads to the idea that the primary goal could be to save face, not to do what’s best for constituents. This feels, at the moment, like a mess. A mess of politics and business, sure, but of emotions and community ties as well. That doesn’t mean it will end up that way. But in the first days since the plans were unveiled, everything is still raw. It’s important to remember, as we parse the details of the proposal, that this is a beginning, not a conclusion. Through all the twists and turns ahead, it’s also important to remember that the wins and losses people care about aren’t whether Monumental ends up with a practice facility attached to its arena attached to a concert venue attached to bars and restaurants. Rather, it’s what happens on the court and the ice. In the time before a new arena deal gets finalized or falls apart, hold Leonsis accountable for that, too.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/17/ted-leonsis-wizards-capitals/,Washington Post,2023-12-17 06:00:00,
"The Colorado Supreme Court’s   from that state’s 2024 primary ballot for engaging in insurrection serves more as a prelude than the main event.

They instantly stayed their ruling until Jan. 4, just before a key deadline for finalizing the ballot, so the case can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Colorado Supreme Court’s   from that state’s 2024 primary ballot for engaging in insurrection serves more as a prelude than the main event. Indeed, the Colorado justices took great pains to emphasize that their   probably wouldn’t — and even  — be the final word.

They also allowed Trump to stay on the ballot after that date even if the matter is merely unresolved; all Trump has to do is file an appeal, and he would remain on the ballot until the high court acts. The decision, as momentous as it was, amounted to essentially putting the ball in the Supreme Court’s court and inviting it to speak, adding to the high court’s  . And the Supreme Court will speak, either through its action or inaction. That’s because, despite all the litigation on this matter, there isn’t really a road map. The Colorado district and appeals courts’ rulings on this matter broke ground not just because of the outcome, but because they actually addressed the merits of the central claim. That claim is that Trump is disqualified from office under the 14th Amendment because he engaged in insurrection in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. While courts in Michigan and Minnesota previously turned aside challenges to Trump’s ballot eligibility, they did so without considering the insurrection question. Rather, they said the issue wasn’t theirs to decide right now. The   last month didn’t even mention the word insurrection, merely saying it was up to the state Republican Party whether Trump would be on the primary ballot. A   last week agreed with a lower court that the issue wasn’t “ripe” because Trump hadn’t even been placed on its ballot yet. The Michigan appeals court said that “it is unnecessary to make any determinations regarding whether Trump engaged in insurrection or is actually disqualified from holding the office of President of the United States by the Fourteenth Amendment, at least at this time.” Colorado state law provided   for its courts to actually go there. It allows voters to challenge a candidate’s qualifications, even before that candidate is placed on the ballot, if an elected official like a secretary of state is “about to commit a breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act” by placing them on the ballot. And the law then requires a speedy resolution. The judges took that opportunity. A state district court judge ruled that Trump isn’t disqualified, but only because a president isn’t subject to the 14th Amendment’s disqualification clause. Still she offered  . The state Supreme Court agreed on the insurrection aspect but said a president  subject to disqualification, disqualifying Trump in a 4-3 decision. What was also notable about the 4-3 decision is how the dissenting judges, like their brethren in Minnesota and Michigan, didn’t really wrestle with the merits of the 14th Amendment claim. Each argued that the state’s law didn’t envision the courts so speedily dealing with such weighty and subjective matters of national import. Two of them raised the fact that Trump hadn’t been charged with or convicted of the crime of insurrection — but only in service of arguing that the state law didn’t apply. Justice Carlos Samour Jr. came closest to addressing federal law when he said he didn’t believe that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment was “self-executing.” In other words, he said, Congress must pass a law detailing how the section is to be enforced, which it hasn’t. The U.S. Supreme Court, should it take up the case, will be a different animal. It is not charged with interpreting state law. So most of the reasoning in the dissents and in the Minnesota and Michigan rulings won’t apply. That doesn’t mean it will ultimately wrestle with the question of whether Trump engaged in insurrection; it could reject his disqualification for other reasons. It could say, like the state district court judge did, that the 14th Amendment doesn’t apply to presidents. It could align with Samour in saying that the 14th Amendment isn’t self-executing. But punting on the merits of the insurrection claim — or failing to at least set a standard for what it means to “engage in insurrection” — would create its own big tangle as Trump heads into his criminal trials. The Colorado district court and the Colorado Supreme Court have both now said Trump engaged in insurrection. Other judges have   with that general proposition. The  we have suggests that Americans agree that Trump is disqualified under the 14th Amendment by sizable, double-digit margins. Against that backdrop, it would be conspicuous for the Supreme Court not to delve into that claim in some way. Leaving this issue unsettled risks its becoming more explosive. Merely saying the 14th Amendment doesn’t apply to presidents would essentially mean insurrectionists are allowed to serve as president. Saying the 14th Amendment isn’t self-executing would still invite Congress to lay out a procedure for disqualifying Trump. “If we don’t get a final judicial resolution before January 6, 2025 a Democratic-majority Congress could decide Trump is disqualified even if he appears to win the electoral college vote,” UCLA law professor Rick Hasen  . “That would be tremendously destabilizing.” The Supreme Court could reason that weighing in on whether Trump engaged in insurrection might prejudice his criminal indictments (he’s not charged with that specific crime, but is charged with related crimes). But that risks effectively giving the Colorado Supreme Court the final — and really, only — legal word on that matter. Very few of Trump’s defenders are focused on the merits right now. Rather, they’ve cast this as being about taking down Trump and depriving voters of a choice. Trump defenders have generally avoided addressing the merits of his actions. That was true of  , when Senate Republicans acquitted him largely on a technicality. It was true  . It’s also    . It’s rarely about what Trump did; it’s almost always about the idea that he’s being targeted. If nothing else, Colorado has given the U.S. Supreme Court a chance to have that discussion.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/21/how-far-might-supreme-court-go-trump-insurrection/,Washington Post,2023-12-21 17:27:00,
"Food security advocates and D.C. Council members celebrated when the District finished the 2023 fiscal year with more revenue than expected: That extra money   benefits by nearly $40 million in the new year. But now the administration of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) says it’s not moving forward with the enhanced aid, deflating the advocates and council members who fought for the boost after witnessing the soaring need for food assistance following the expiration of pandemic-era federal relief. Food security advocates and D.C. Council members celebrated when the District finished the 2023 fiscal year with more revenue than expected: That extra money   benefits by nearly $40 million in the new year. But now the administration of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) says it’s not moving forward with the enhanced aid, deflating the advocates and council members who fought for the boost after witnessing the soaring need for food assistance following the expiration of pandemic-era federal relief. Council members were outraged during a breakfast meeting Tuesday and throughout the week, accusing the Bowser administration of choosing to ignore the council’s budget directive to use the money to temporarily boost the District’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Roughly 140,000 District residents rely on the program to feed their families, for whom advocates say even a small increase in benefits can make a significant difference. But Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for health and human services, said the choice not to increase the benefits is one born of financial necessity, as many of the District’s social services programs are overburdened, over budget and more in need of the cash. “The budget for the Department of Human Services, to put it mildly, is underwater at this point,” he said in a Friday interview. The situation sets up another clash between the D.C. Council and the Bowser administration over how to fund critical social services programs, disagreements that have become a pattern over the past year or two and have increasingly angered council members. But it also underscores an inescapable reality in the District: Crushing demand for social services is repeatedly outpacing the city’s budget, forcing difficult decisions about which programs to prioritize even as council members criticize the administration for poor budget planning. Council member Christina Henderson (I-At Large), who led the Give SNAP a Raise legislation, said she understood that reality — but in this case, she said, the money is available, the council specifically allocated the money for SNAP, and that’s how it should be used. “They’re trying to bank money. And I recognize — I’m not naive — I recognize the challenges the city is facing,” Henderson said, also noting the $750 million shortfall the region’s public transportation system is confronting. “That means we also have to take care of our people. Food access should always be at the top of our list. Feeding people and making sure folks can stay housed should always be at the top of our list.” Henderson’s legislation, which would give eligible families or seniors a 10 percent increase in their benefits, sprouted from the economic strain caused by the pandemic and the soaring inflation that hit grocery store shelves. In 2019, about 94,000 District residents relied on SNAP, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. By 2020, that number climbed to roughly 135,000 residents, an increase of 44 percent, and has only grown since. Pandemic-era enhanced federal aid expired in March, leaving tens of thousands of District residents with far less money to spend on food even though, for many, their economic situations had not improved. Henderson hoped Give SNAP a Raise could fill some of that gap. During a tough budget season this spring, council member Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4) included a provision that would allow Henderson’s legislation to move forward on a contingency basis. The provision would trigger nearly $40 million in additional SNAP benefits for nine months from January to September 2024 — but only if there was excess revenue at the end of fiscal 2023, which there was. That’s why food security advocates were perplexed to learn that, despite the $178.8 million in excess revenue that the chief financial officer announced Sept. 30, the Bowser administration was not preparing to roll out enhanced SNAP benefits. “Our SNAP participants have experienced a lot of harm through the ending of the SNAP emergency allotment and just overall food access and food insecurity, the rising food costs,” said LaMonika Jones, director of D.C. Hunger Solutions, which pushed hard for the boosted benefits. “So to hear this news that the mayor has stated that there is not an intent to fund or disburse those funds for Give SNAP a Raise is very disappointing.” Turnage said that he believed the goal to expand SNAP was “laudable.” But he said that goal is colliding with the reality that DHS’s spending is already outpacing its budget, with a $22.5 million shortfall just two months into the fiscal year that Turnage expects will only grow. “When you have a picture of a department frankly underwater with respect to its budget, with significant spending pressures they have to resolve, some of which could impact essential services we simply cannot stop,” Turnage said, “it would be financially reckless to take on another $39 million budget cost until we have resolved some of those issues.” A spokesman for Lewis George objected Saturday morning, noting it is not a new cost but simply a way to use unanticipated funds, and the administration should find other ways to resolve the budgeting problems. Turnage said the agency is stretched thin and can’t contemplate expanding a program at the moment. He said staff members are mired in processing Medicaid recertification paperwork for thousands of people, along with backlogs of existing SNAP applications.   the worst   nationwide. But Henderson said hearing about staffing issues now frustrated her because she had worked closely with DHS in developing the legislation to try to ensure it would minimize administrative costs. She added that other spending pressures, such as a cost-of-living rate hike associated with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), could have been anticipated and should not have been a surprise. Turnage said he would have to review how officials budgeted for TANF — but said that more often the spending pressure is due to ballooning demand in key programs beyond what they were intended to handle. For example, formerly homeless families are staying in the Family Re-Housing Stabilization Program far longer than the program was designed for because many are not able to be stably housed without aid after the one-year program ends, driving up the cost of the program by tens of millions of dollars, Turnage said. The council in July passed emergency legislation that allowed for extensions in the housing program under certain guardrails — but one guardrail was that DHS could offer extensions to families only if funding was available. In  , Henderson noted that if DHS were following this provision of the law, the legislation should not be causing severe spending pressures. Turnage argued that’s easier said than done, noting that not offering families extensions for their housing would risk making them homeless. “The question is, how would people respond both inside and outside of government to seeing hundreds of people evicted because we have not been able to move them from FRSP to a more stable housing situation?” he said. That conundrum with the Family Re-Housing and Stabilization Program, also known as rapid rehousing, has been one of the most significant areas of disagreement with the council over the past year. Most recently, Bowser wanted $20.6 million that the council allocated for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) to instead go toward rapid rehousing, after the administration had to dip into contingency funds to house hundreds of families. The council, however,  , arguing that addressing the soaring demand for ERAP took priority. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), one of the biggest critics of rapid rehousing, argued that it was more productive to spend the money on helping people pay rent to avoid homelessness versus paying millions housing them after they become homeless. Council member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) compared Bowser’s desire to use ERAP funds for rapid rehousing to the latest battle over the allocated SNAP funds. “Mayor Bowser is trying to reduce funding for food assistance and for rental assistance. But it’s not because of an unexpected financial emergency. It’s because of irresponsible budgeting,” White  DHS can’t move around millions of dollars without council approval. Turnage said that the administration plans to submit a request to redirect the nearly $40 million in SNAP funds but that officials have not settled yet on how they will ask for the money to be spent. Henderson said she fears that by the time the disagreement is settled, months will have passed, and the opportunity may be lost because of the temporary nature of the benefits boost. “We needed to figure out how to make this permanent,” she said. “I’m going to continue working on that front, even in the quote-unquote budget pressure conversation, because when people can’t eat, when people can’t feed their families, they do desperate things.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/09/snap-dc-benefits-food-assistance-funds/,Washington Post,2023-12-09 12:03:00,

MALMÖ, Sweden — Every day, port workers here in Sweden’s third-largest city unload shipping containers, oil, chemicals and building materials destined for places across the country. But there’s one thing they won’t touch: Tesla cars. For six weeks, dockworkers at Swedish ports have refused to load or unload the electric cars made by billionaire Elon Musk. They’re part of a growing movement of workers across Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark who are protesting in support of striking Swedish Tesla technicians and their demand for a   on the terms of their employment. “We’re going to take the fight all the way,” Curt Hansson, a 55-year-old dockworker here said in an interview during a break from unloading ships on a cold, gray December day. “Either he leaves or signs an agreement.” Since October, when the technicians first went on strike, tens of thousands of workers in Northern Europe have joined the largest coordinated labor action against Tesla since its founding in 2003. Norwegian and Finnish ports have likewise closed to Tesla shipments. Danish truck drivers won’t transport Teslas through their country. Postal workers have refused to deliver license plates to new Tesla drivers in Sweden, cleaners won’t work in the company’s Swedish offices and electricians won’t service its charging points here. On Friday, Swedish waste collectors added their support, refusing to pick up from Tesla’s repair shops across the country. The solidarity blockades have the potential to disrupt Tesla sales in Northern Europe — a relatively small market compared with the United States and China, but a wealthy and environmentally conscious one, with some of the most electric vehicles per capita in the world. Even more, though, the labor actions are being watched as a test case for global efforts to crack Musk’s strict no-unions policy. “Elon Musk isn’t making an agreement in Sweden because he’s afraid … it will create follow-ups in other countries, even the U.S.,” said Jan Villadsen, chairman of a Danish union that represents 50,000 transport workers, including truck drivers and dock workers blockading Teslas. At Tesla’s  , the company’s second production hub outside the United States, a growing number of the roughly 11,000 workers want to organize, German union officials say. And the United Auto Workers, fresh off its victory in strikes against Ford, General Motors and Chrysler-owner Stellantis, has said Tesla would be one of its  . “If Tesla gives in to the unions around this ongoing dispute, it could create a growing brush fire in Europe that eventually gets to the UAW and U.S. in 2024,” said Dan Ives, a New York-based analyst with Wedbush Securities. “It’s an important lightning rod issue around unions globally.” Neither Tesla nor Musk responded to requests for comment. But Musk has weighed in publicly on the labor actions in Sweden. On his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, he replied to a post about mail carriers refusing to deliver license plates to his customers by writing, “ .” He has also been clear about his attitude toward unions. “I don’t like anything which creates a lords-and-peasants kind of thing, and I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company,”   in November. “If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it, and it failed in some way.” “Lords and peasants” is exactly the kind of relationship Tesla insists on having with its workers in Sweden, said Jānis Kuzma, 37, one of the striking technicians. Kuzma said he joined Tesla in 2021 because he wanted to work on electric vehicles. He and his wife own a Tesla Model Y themselves. But as the company sold more cars in Sweden, the burden on its technicians increased, he said. He and the others at the Malmö service center had to take on a lot more work. The next-closest Tesla workshop was 170 miles away, so not a realistic alternative for most drivers. After Tesla refused to give him a raise, Kuzma said, he decided to join the push for a collective agreement. The management didn’t seem to care that such agreements between companies and their employees are a central part of the  , relied on in the absence of regulations such as a statutory minimum wage and credited with making strikes and other labor disruptions so rare. Kuzma said he was told, “Maybe Tesla is not for everybody.” Several weeks into the strike, he said his manager called and accused him of leaking company secrets. The issue: Kuzma’s wife had criticized Tesla on X. “The craziest part is they were monitoring, they were checking my wife’s profile,” he said. Kuzma pushed back with the help of a union lawyer, who argued that Tesla’s employee confidentiality provision, originally written for its U.S. workforce, could not trump Swedish free speech protections, which allow workers — and their partners — to talk about work conditions. Today, about 65 percent of Swedish workers are part of unions, one of the highest rates in the world, and nearly 90 percent are covered by a collective agreement, according to the  . “If you come to Sweden, you have to abide by these rules,” said Anders Linde, a Swedish postal worker and union activist in Malmö, who is participating in the effort to block Tesla’s mail. “We have fought for these rules for generations, so we’re not going to give them up easily.” Foreign companies have tried to deviate from the prevailing model in the past. In 1995, Swedish Toys R Us employees went on   before the U.S. company relented to signing a collective agreement. Hansson, the dock worker in Malmö, remembers that strike well — it was the last time he participated in a blockade, until now. It is not yet clear how the strike and sympathy actions will affect Tesla sales. The company’s Model Y crossover SUV was the  . In Sweden, it beat out Swedish-founded Volvo’s competing XC40, according to  , an association of automakers and importers. But Tesla no doubt is facing a public relations problem. The strike has been one of the biggest news stories in Sweden over several months, and opinion polls show the public is broadly supportive. For those looking to buy a new electric car, the fear of not being able to have their Tesla serviced could be enough to push them toward an alternative, said Tibor Blömhall, 55, president of Tesla Club Sweden, which represents 17,000 Tesla owners and electric car enthusiasts. “I’m very concerned about the image of Tesla in Sweden,” Blömhall said. “Somehow owning a Tesla car has become a statement.” Just like in the United States, Musk’s   on X, his posts questioning transgender rights and his strict anti-union stance, has cast a political shadow on his car company and  . “I’ve seen bumper stickers now: ‘I bought my Tesla before Elon became an idiot,’” Linde, the postal worker, said over a cup of coffee overlooking Malmö’s 16th-century town square. Union leaders with IF Metall, which is representing the striking Tesla technicians, said they first tried to sign a collective agreement with Tesla in 2017. The company rebuffed them. Since then, both the union’s membership among Tesla workers and the company’s presence in Sweden have grown. “That’s why we decided right now to try again to negotiate,” said Marie Nilsson, president of IF Metall. The union had some talks with Tesla, but the company isn’t interested in making an agreement, Nilsson said. So the technicians went on strike with IF Metall’s backing, and other unions ordered sympathy actions, which are protected by Swedish law. Not all the roughly 130 Tesla technicians in Sweden are striking. Neither Tesla nor the union would confirm numbers. Blömhall said an informal survey by Tesla Club Sweden members suggested the number could be as low as 13 or 14. Tesla owners are still able to get their cars fixed in the country, he said. Still, the solidarity blockades and selective strikes could have a more serious impact. Body shops and car painters not associated with Tesla are refusing to work on the vehicles out of solidarity, creating frustrations for Tesla owners who feel they’re being targeted, Blömhall said. IF Metall wants the disruption to go further. In November, workers at a Swedish aluminum auto parts maker that supplies Tesla’s factory in Germany said they would   for the company, potentially disrupting production. PensionDanmark, a major pension fund in Denmark, sold its $70 million stake in Tesla in early December out of solidarity with the workers. Musk, for his part, still isn’t showing any willingness to negotiate. “IF Metall is extremely stubborn, and Mr. Elon Musk is known to be extremely stubborn, too,” Blömhall said. “They have dug trenches, and nobody is giving up.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/tesla-strike-sweden-elon-musk/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 09:43:00,
"The Green Bay Packers suspended cornerback Jaire Alexander one game Wednesday for conduct detrimental to the team stemming from an incident during the coin toss before Sunday’s 33-30 win at the Carolina Panthers.

The Green Bay Packers suspended cornerback Jaire Alexander one game Wednesday for conduct detrimental to the team stemming from an incident during the coin toss before Sunday’s 33-30 win at the Carolina Panthers. Packers General Manager Brian Gutekunst   the decision, which will leave the team without its star cornerback for Sunday night’s critical Week 17 matchup with the Minnesota Vikings. “The decision to suspend a player is never easy and not one we take lightly. Unfortunately, Jaire’s actions prior to the game in Carolina led us to take this step,” Gutekunst said in the announcement. “As an organization, we have an expectation that everyone puts the team first. While we are disappointed, we had a good conversation with Jaire this morning and fully expect him to learn from this as we move forward together. We look forward to welcoming him back next week as he is a valued member of this team and will continue to be in the future.” The Packers have chosen team captains on a weekly rotation this year, rather than naming select players before the season. During Sunday’s game at Carolina, Alexander was not one of them. Still, the sixth-year player joined designated captains Aaron Jones, Eric Wilson and Quay Walker at midfield for the pregame coin toss. Alexander called tails, the Packers won the toss, and Alexander said Green Bay wanted to be on defense — rather than saying it deferred its choice to the second half. While the difference is technical, Alexander’s call could have been taken to mean Green Bay wanted to kick off, which would have allowed Carolina to receive the ball at the start of both halves. Referee Alex Kemp clarified that Alexander meant the Packers wanted to defer, which Coach Matt LaFleur had told him in a pregame meeting with the officials they would do if they won the coin toss. Alexander’s near-botched call could have cost Green Bay a possession in its three-point win over the Panthers as the team vies for a playoff berth. For now, the Packers are  . LaFleur said after the game that Alexander’s call was “a big mistake.” “That’s something that you review with the guys before they go out there every time about, ‘Hey, we win the toss, we’re going to defer,’ ” he said. “I went to the officials before the game, made sure they knew what we were going to do. We had an incident earlier this year where we had a similar situation, so always trying to be proactive in that approach.” Alexander, 26, grew up in Charlotte. The NFL’s highest-paid cornerback by average annual value,  , has 26 tackles, four passes defended and a forced fumble this season, during which he has been limited to six games by injuries. Of his motivation to participate in the coin toss despite not being designated as a captain, Alexander said after the game: “It’s only suiting. I don’t think Coach knew I was from Charlotte, so …” Jaire Alexander wasn’t announced by the Packers as a game captain, but he went out for the coin toss anyway. And called it. And won it. And almost messed it up. Sounds like he just did it on his own. “It’s only suiting. I don’t think coach knew I was from Charlotte.”  Before Sunday’s win, the two-time Pro Bowl pick had missed the previous six games with a shoulder injury. He missed three games this season because of a back issue. “I said, ‘I want our defense to be out there,’ and they all looked at me like I was crazy,” Alexander   after the game. “I’m like, ‘I mean, it’s pretty simple what I said — I want the defense to be out there.’ They like, ‘You mean defer?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, I guess.’ ” When asked whether the coaches added Alexander as a game captain or if Alexander appointed himself, LaFleur told reporters, “Yeah.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/27/packers-suspend-jaire-alexander-coin-toss/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 17:58:00,

Youngkin said his program, called “Building Blocks for Virginia Families,” would allow eligible parents to choose what kind of child care they want to use, such as home-care providers or community co-ops. “This is about families, this is about moms, and Virginians shouldn’t have to worry about getting their children the care they need when they’re at work. but unfortunately so many do,” Youngkin said. The governor said families that already receive child-care support will “continue to have access to early childhood and afterschool programs.” Youngkin also said the program would expand the requirement that parents are employed if they want to receive child care, although he did not offer details. “By expanding the requirements that parents work toward participate in this plan, we are focusing our considerable investment on parents who are working to keep all of those balls in the air as they juggle them and we are ensuring good stewardship of the resources required to make this successful,” he said. Youngkin described the plan as “fiscally sustainable,” and called for more than $440 million to be spent each year over the next two fiscal years — representing an increase of $180 million in state spending over each of those years. Rachael Deane, chief executive at Voices for Virginia’s Children, a statewide advocacy group, said the issue of funding for child care and early education has been “a real crisis,” both in Virginia and nationally. A report from the nonpartisan Virginia Joint Audit and Review Commission found that “child care is incredibly inaccessible to parents in Virginia, and it is unaffordable for more than three-quarters of families across the state,” she said. While pandemic funds were used to expand access to child care and early education in Virginia, Deane said, “as it’s been sunsetting, the question is, what do we do now?” Youngkin said the proposed child care program would include a “digital wallet” that each family can use to “find care and direct care to where it fits their family the best,” and would allow “local governments, employers, philanthropy and others who will contribute towards this great need.” A $25 million capital fund to serve 3,000 children in child care deserts, Youngkin said, would be modeled after an effort in Southwest Virginia that brought public and private resources together to remodel an unused building into a child care and workforce development center. The funding would be used for new “early learning hubs” in unused spaces at colleges. The proposal also includes funding to continue a $1 million scholarship program for early education workers, and $10 million a year for incentives for educators. A spokeswoman for Youngkin did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for additional information about the governor’s proposal. “The   plan is about public and private stakeholders coming together,” Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera said in a news release. “We will address childcare deserts, early childhood provider shortages and introduce innovation and partnerships into how we pay for childcare for a sustainable system.” Youngkin’s predecessor, Ralph Northam (D), had   during his term, a signature issue also for  . David Cary, Pamela Northam’s chief of staff and assistant secretary of early-childhood education at the end of the Northam administration, said many of the initiatives announced Thursday are continuations of previous programs that had bipartisan support when they were passed. “This is all good and we can all agree on this,” Cary said. The governor will need to work with   on this proposal. Youngkin is slated to propose his two-year spending plan on Dec. 20, after which the Democratic-controlled Senate and House of Delegates — which   in last month’s elections — will take it up. Del. Luke Torian (D-Prince William), incoming House Appropriations Committee chair, said he hadn’t had a chance to see Youngkin’s proposal, but noted that both child care and early education are vital issues in the commonwealth. “Obviously education is an important component to the budget process, so we’ll take a look at his numbers,” Torian said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/07/youngkin-child-care-early-education-funding/,Washington Post,2023-12-07 16:31:00,
"A pair of companies are planning to launch uncrewed spacecraft to the moon within weeks of each other early next year in a NASA-funded effort that could mark the first soft landings for the United States on the lunar surface since the last of   in 1972. A pair of companies are planning to launch uncrewed spacecraft to the moon within weeks of each other early next year in a NASA-funded effort that could mark the first soft landings for the United States on the lunar surface since the last of   in 1972. But in a sign of how the commercial space industry is transforming exploration, the companies are also vying for another historic first: to become the first private venture to land on the moon. On Jan. 8, Astrobotic, a company based in Pittsburgh, is scheduled to launch its Peregrine spacecraft on the inaugural launch of the Vulcan rocket, which is operated by the  , the joint venture of Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Then, in mid-February, from another pad at Cape Canaveral in Florida, Intuitive Machines is set to launch its lander on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket. The missions are related to NASA’s Artemis program, which intends to return astronauts to the lunar surface. But these missions are part of an effort called the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, which is aimed to send cargo and   to the moon. In   five years ago, then-NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said he wanted to harness the capabilities of private industry to go quickly and inexpensively. “What we’re going for here is speed,” he said at the time. Several companies are eligible to compete for $2.6 billion worth of contracts over 10 years. And after years of delays, the first missions are finally happening, with more to come. “This is an exciting time,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in an interview. “These guys can become scouts for the astronauts that we’re going to land on the moon. And we can learn things about the moon that otherwise we couldn’t have because we couldn’t have these many landings.” It’s not clear which company would land first. Astrobotic said in a release that if it launches as scheduled on Jan. 8, its spacecraft would touch down on Feb. 23. A spokesperson for Intuitive Machines said the company expects to land “approximately seven days after launch.” Its launch date had been scheduled for Jan. 12, but was moved back to mid-February because “unfavorable weather conditions resulted in shifts in the SpaceX launch manifest.” The company has not yet released an exact launch or landing date. The missions come as several nations have sent spacecraft to the moon in recent years. And the   is hoping its robotic lander, which launched on Sept. 7, would touch down on Jan. 19. That would make it the fifth country to soft land on the moon and come just months after   a craft on the lunar surface in August. But landing on the moon is risky — and many have tried and failed in the past. Earlier this year, ispace, a Japanese company,   as it attempted to land on the moon. Russia also   attempting a lunar landing this year. In recent years, China has sent a   to the moon, starting with orbiters in 2007 and again in 2010. Then, in 2013, it landed the Chang’e 3 spacecraft, becoming the first nation to soft land on the moon since the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s. In early 2019, China made history by landing the first spacecraft on the moon’s far side. And in 2020 it brought back samples from the lunar surface in another impressive demonstration of its growing ambitions. Under  , NASA intends to land astronauts on the moon in the coming years, perhaps as soon as 2025, but probably later. After successfully sending the Orion spacecraft without anyone on board around the moon last year, it is planning a lunar flyby mission with astronauts. That was initially scheduled for late next year, but Nelson said the timeline might slip into 2025. “They’re going through all kinds of testing,” he said, adding that the space agency intends to provide an update on the schedule “early in the New Year.” But before then, NASA is hoping to make several robotic landings to help pave the way. In addition to the two scheduled for early in the year, NASA is planning to send its first robotic rover to the moon on an Astrobotic spacecraft. Called VIPER (for Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover), the golf-cart sized vehicle would be outfitted with a drill to search for water in the form of ice near the lunar south pole. “If this all works out, what an amazing tool to support humans on the surface of the moon but also to do exciting science and commercial activities in ways that otherwise are not achievable,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, the former head of NASA’s science division who oversaw the program. Still, he said, the approach of partnering with the commercial sector for such missions “needs to be proven,” and landing on the moon is an incredibly difficult task. Chances of a successful landing on any mission, he estimated, are about 50 percent. But having two companies going for it at the same time increases the chances of an American spacecraft on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years. John Thornton, CEO of Astrobotic, told reporters recently that he was well aware of the risks. “It’s certainly a daunting challenge,” he said. “I mean, I am going to be terrified and thrilled all at once every stage.” While he said there is a competition to get to the moon first, he said the primary objective is “to create a movement of commercial deliveries to the surface. The most important and top priority of that is the industry’s success. That’s Astrobotic position since day one — we need this industry to succeed. We need this program to succeed.” Another challenge is that its Peregrine spacecraft is to launch on the first flight of ULA’s Vulcan rocket. While the first launch of any rocket is risky, Thornton said that ULA has “a really stellar track record of success and we are very confident.” Intuitive Machines is confident as well. “The vehicle is ready,” Stephen Altemus, CEO of Intuitive Machines, said in an interview in October. “It’s performing wonderfully. … We know the odds of what we’re up against. We’ve done extensive testing beyond development testing, to make sure that the vehicle is performing as designed. And we’re confident coming out of our reviews that we’ve hammered all those issues flat, and that we know how the vehicle behaves.” Being in the position of returning the United States to the moon “is a heavy load that we take really seriously as a business,” he said. “We picked up all the lessons learned from all the other attempts that have gone before us. In the end, somebody’s going to break that barrier and be the first commercial company to do it. And for the first commercial company to be a United States company, I think, is fantastic.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/24/astrobotics-intuitive-machines-soft-landing-moon/,Washington Post,2023-12-24 13:01:00,
"SEATTLE — It stands about 215 feet in the air, weighs more than 11,000 tons, covers an area of nearly nine acres and is powered by 96 10-horsepower engines moving it at the breakneck speed of 50 feet per minute. And it’s at the crux of why the NHL felt comfortable bringing its marquee event to start the new year in a place known to be rather damp in wintertime. SEATTLE — It stands about 215 feet in the air, weighs more than 11,000 tons, covers an area of nearly nine acres and is powered by 96 10-horsepower engines moving it at the breakneck speed of 50 feet per minute. And it’s at the crux of why the NHL felt comfortable bringing its marquee event to start the new year in a place known to be rather damp in wintertime. When the Vegas Golden Knights and Seattle Kraken meet on Monday in the Winter Classic, the NHL hopes the story is centered on the clash between the league’s two newest franchises, one of which happens to be the reigning Stanley Cup champions. But bringing the game to the Pacific Northwest meant relying on a mechanical structure the league hopes won’t be needed on the day of the game but has proven invaluable in protecting the rink in the leadup to the event — the retractable roof of T-Mobile Park. That’s part of the story, too. “I think it’s a good story and it’s part of the story of Seattle,” NHL chief content officer Steve Mayer said. “This is a place that has a little rain.” The game Monday will be the 39th outdoor game the NHL has conducted. And they have every intent of it being a truly outdoor game, even with the possible protection provided by playing in the retractable roof stadium. For now, the forecast seems to be in the NHL’s favor. After a stretch of wet days, the weather on game-day looks to be a mix of sun and clouds with temperatures in the mid-40s. But it’s the leadup to the game where the roof that allows the Seattle Mariners to play baseball games protected from the region’s notorious rain and drizzle has proven invaluable in the process of building a hockey rink. For previous outdoor games, the league has built contingencies into the construction schedule in case weather became an issue. In Seattle, those contingencies remained, but were mostly not needed. The roof remained closed for the process of building the rink and all the associated elements that come with putting on a hockey game in a baseball stadium. “We always leave some room in there if we get a really bad rain day or something like that, especially when we start building the ice,” said Dean Matsuzaki, the NHL’s executive vice president of events who has been involved with every outdoor NHL game since the first Winter Classic in 2008. “But this we were able to really schedule with a lot of confidence kind of right down to the hour everything that we’ll be able to get done.” The NHL wanted to reward Seattle for how the city and region instantly latched onto the Kraken by brining the Winter Classic to the area. From the start, playing the game at T-Mobile Park was the preferred option because the roof existed, even though Lumen Field has a larger capacity and better sightlines, and Husky Stadium provided a more picturesque setting on the shore of Lake Washington. While the goal for Monday is the roof to be retracted, it’s a multiprong process in making the final call. The league consults with a local meteorologist in the days leading up to the game and the morning of. There will be regular communication with executives from the league and the NHLPA as the game draws closer, including about two hours before puck drop when final decisions are made. In a worst-case scenario should the forecast change and rain become an issue, the NHL could opt to have a panel of the retractable roof cover the ice while leaving the rest of the stadium exposed for a modified open-air experience. The T-Mobile Park roof was constructed in sections, meaning only part of the stadium can be covered. It’s not an all-or-nothing proposition. The only other time the league played one of its stadium events in a building with a retractable roof came in 2014 up the road in Vancouver, British Columbia, for a Heritage Classic game between the Canucks and Ottawa Senators. But a mix of rain and snow led to the roof of BC Place never being opened. It was a stadium game, but not an outdoor game and it lacked the feel the league wanted. That’s why while the roof has been crucial in the build-up, the NHL wants Monday’s event to be played without the umbrella over the top. “The NHL does an amazing job and each year it gets better and better,” Kraken forward Jared McCann said Thursday after getting his first look at the setup. “And obviously, we have the facility here with T-Mobile and the roof and everything to host something much more special and we’re going to try and make the most of it.” ___ AP NHL: ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2023/12/29/winter-classic-kraken-vegas-roof/ac8effc6-a680-11ee-aacb-6f873a65763e_story.html,Washington Post,2023-12-29 14:30:00,
"This week’s announcement that Monumental Sports & Entertainment   to move the Washington Wizards and Capitals from downtown D.C. to a future arena in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood   as area residents envisioned a future without the NBA and NHL teams in the District. What didn’t get as much attention was the future of another franchise owned by Monumental, the WNBA’s Washington Mystics. This week’s announcement that Monumental Sports & Entertainment   to move the Washington Wizards and Capitals from downtown D.C. to a future arena in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood   as area residents envisioned a future without the NBA and NHL teams in the District. What didn’t get as much attention was the future of another franchise owned by Monumental, the WNBA’s Washington Mystics. If plans come to fruition, the Mystics would no longer play their home games at Entertainment and Sports Arena in the Congress Heights neighborhood in Southeast D.C., instead moving back to Capital One Arena, where they played before their first season in the smaller building in 2019. Entertainment and Sports Arena would remain the Mystics’ practice facility and team headquarters and the home of the NBA G League’s Capital City Go-Go. Those plans raise concerns, particularly about why the Mystics would move back to an older building that owner Ted Leonsis and Monumental felt was unfit for the future of the Wizards and Capitals when the Mystics’ current home is just four years old. Additionally, Capital One Arena was previously believed to be too big for the Mystics — the stands in the approximately 20,000-seat venue felt cavernous even when the team would draw a decent crowd — and the 4,200-seat capacity at Entertainment and Sports Arena created a more intimate atmosphere. John Thompson III, the senior vice president of Monumental Basketball, attempted to address those issues in an interview this week, explaining the plan is to renovate Capital One Arena and install flexible seating that can shift the arena’s capacity from 20,000 seats to 10,000 depending on the event. Thompson said the current capacity at Entertainment and Sports Arena is too small. “As great as the environment is [at Entertainment and Sports Arena], and it is unbelievable, we now have an opportunity to multiply that more than twofold,” Thompson said. Part of the thinking is related to an expected growth in Mystics attendance. They averaged 4,391 fans in 2023 — above the arena’s official capacity — and the WNBA saw its highest total attendance since 2010, to go with its best television numbers in more than two decades and new highs in digital engagement. In 2018, the last season the Mystics played their games in Capital One Arena, the team averaged 6,136 tickets sold. A 10,000-seat arena is more in line with the organization’s projections. “For us, it’s a mixed thing,” Mystics General Manager Mike Thibault said. “We’ve gotten used to playing at ESA. From a competitive situation, it’s been a home-court advantage for us. From a business standpoint, it’s limited on the numbers of fans you can put in it, and that’s been tough. We have grown since we moved over there. Our fan base and that kind of thing is something we would like to increase. “From a logistics standpoint for our players and coaches, we want to give our fans the best fan experience and our players the best playing experience. And there’s a lot to be done between now and then.” The adjustments would go beyond game day arrangements. Thompson noted that the Mystics would have more space at Entertainment and Sports Arena once the Wizards move their operations to Northern Virginia, and he compared the potential setup to the Wizards’ current situation, in which they practice in Congress Heights and play downtown. A brother-sister-type relationship has formed between the Wizards and Mystics at the Southeast facility, where the organizations share training and other support staff.  The teams share a cafeteria, and players interact often. The reorientation of the training staff between multiple facilities would be among the more significant issues that would have to be addressed. We haven’t dotted all the I’s and crossed all the T’s of how nuanced every different department is going to be and how we’re going to interact,” Thompson said. “Fortunately, we have four or five years to figure it out. But I do agree that having an environment here where … the Wizards and the Mystics, literally all services are shared, has been and still will continue to be for the next four or five years an incredible experience. “It’s not going to diminish the care that we give to the Mystics. It’s not going to diminish the quality of service, the quality of attention, the quality that they receive. Not at all.” The Mystics won the 2019 WNBA championship at Entertainment and Sports Arena, and from the beginning of their time there, the organization has touted the importance of its relationship with the community, especially Southeast D.C. The team essentially adopted Ward 8, and it hoped the building would bring more people to the area and help spur development. New condominiums can be found nearby, and a community center recently opened next door, but the area hasn’t been developed as many predicted. In this week’s announcement, Monumental noted that it has “provided the residents of Ward 8 nearly $11 million in direct and in-kind contributions to date, as of the end of 2023. That amount surpasses the $10 million the company promised to deliver as part of its lease agreement with D.C.” If the Mystics relocate their home games, the situation in Ward 8 could be similar to that downtown, where city officials are concerned that relocating the two primary tenants of Capital One Arena will have adverse effects on the surrounding area. “The departure of the Capitals and Wizards would be detrimental for our downtown and the District as a whole,” Ward 2 Council member Brooke Pinto (D) said, “and we would need to fill that void intentionally and urgently by following the successful models we have across the District — multiuse corridors that include a mixture of work, entertainment and residential density.” Thompson was adamant that Monumental isn’t abandoning D.C. or Ward 8 and that the relationships and community investments will continue. “The Mystics and the Go-Go will be here,” Thompson said. “What we do in the community will not change. ... We have time to prepare. When we’re not here, how are we going to stay invested in this community? We have years to make those plans and hold ourselves accountable to that.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/16/where-will-the-mystics-play/,Washington Post,2023-12-16 05:15:00,
"LOS ANGELES — The Boston Celtics opened a four-game swing through California last week by blowing a lead against the Golden State Warriors, stirring up painful memories of the late-game struggles that prematurely ended recent postseason runs. Since then, Boston has left no doubt, taking care of business in blowout victories over the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Clippers before ruining the Los Angeles Lakers’ Christmas with a convincing 126-115 win Monday. LOS ANGELES — The Boston Celtics opened a four-game swing through California last week by blowing a lead against the Golden State Warriors, stirring up painful memories of the late-game struggles that prematurely ended recent postseason runs. Since then, Boston has left no doubt, taking care of business in blowout victories over the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Clippers before ruining the Los Angeles Lakers’ Christmas with a convincing 126-115 win Monday. The Celtics used the holiday stage to state their case as the NBA’s best team and the favorites to win the 2024 title by immediately seizing control against their archrivals at Crypto.com Arena. Boston improved its record to a league-best 23-6, flashing improved balance on the heels of a splashy offseason that included trades for   and  . All five Celtics starters scored in double figures, and they put away the Lakers (16-15) with suffocating defense in the second half. The new-and-improved Celtics, who rank third in offensive efficiency, fifth in defensive efficiency and second in point differential, have displayed greater consistency thanks to the league’s most talented starting lineup. Boston can score in volume even when star wings Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown struggle from the field as they did Monday, and its defense boasts size, athleticism, length and plenty of postseason experience. “We expected to be good,” Tatum said. “We know what our ultimate goal is. We all know how to play the game. It was only a matter of time for us jelling. We’ve been playing really, really well. ... We haven’t had a low-post presence like [Porzingis] since I’ve been on the Celtics. He creates so many problems [for opposing defenses].” Monday was emblematic of Boston’s ability to find successful counters and auxiliary options. Facing persistent questions about its dependence on the three-point shot, the Celtics went 13 for 42 (31 percent) from deep yet still cruised to the win thanks to a varied attack that applied constant pressure to the Lakers’ interior defense and a defensive effort that held the Los Angeles supporting cast in check. Porzingis, who finished with a team-high 28 points and 11 rebounds, showed off his midrange game and his ability to finish at the rim. Holiday added 18 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, and Derrick White posted 18 points and 11 assists to go with several key defensive stops down the stretch. “We’re like a really powerful engine,” Porzingis said. “We just have that margin. If the threes were falling tonight, it would have been a plus-20 or plus-25 game for us. ... We’ve been starting to run a bit more, get out in transition more. We’re even more dangerous when we get out and run.” Boston sought to spoil the centerpiece of   as soon as it started, racing to a 12-0 lead in the first three minutes. Moving the ball ahead of a Lakers defense that was a step slow, the Celtics extended their lead to 18 points before the first quarter ended. “We came back a little lethargic,” Lakers Coach Darvin Ham said, noting his team had played six of its previous seven games on the road. “The whole Christmas circumstances of the holiday [and an] early game, it took us a little time getting going. ... We have a lot of work to do. It’s not so much our level of talent or our competition. We can’t skip the details. We can’t get bored with the details.” Los Angeles pulled back into the contest during a second quarter marked by injuries and controversy. With four minutes left before halftime, Brown stumbled near midcourt as he tried to shake free for a pass and was rear-ended by Lakers forward LeBron James. The stars lay on the court side by side for an extended stretch; Brown favored his lower back as James held his left knee. The scene brought a hush to a festive building and conjured memories of  . James exited the game but returned after a brief respite; Brown left Boston’s bench area and sat out for the rest of the half before reentering to start the third quarter. Moments after the collision, James made it clear he was feeling no ill effects by soaring for a chase-down block of Tatum. To James’s dismay, he was whistled for a foul, prompting a coach’s challenge. The referees ruled that James had cleanly blocked Tatum but that Lakers forward Taurean Prince had committed a foul during the sequence. The ruling put Tatum at the free throw line and prompted boos from the home crowd. Despite the injury scare and the highlight block that went for naught, the Lakers whittled the Celtics’ lead to one at halftime and took their first lead when James made a jump hook shortly after the break. Anthony Davis was the Lakers’ driving force, posting a game-high 40 points to go with 13 rebounds and four assists. But the Lakers struggled to crack Boston’s switching defense as the Celtics reasserted themselves in the third quarter. “They were just clicking on all cylinders,” Davis said. “The turnovers [and] the transition game hurt us tonight. Against a team like that, the best team in the league, they make you pay for it.” Boston’s defensive scheme used Holiday and Brown to hound James while deploying the 7-foot-2 Porzingis near the rim as a help defender. Though Davis excelled, James finished with just 16 points, tied for his season low, to go with nine rebounds and eight assists. The four-time MVP checked out with nearly three minutes remaining and the result in hand for Boston as Los Angeles fell to 2-6 since  . “I don’t think we’re where we want to be to compete versus the top teams until we continue to get better and better,” James said. “My knee is a little sore right now. The best thing is that finally the schedule is in our favor with two days before we have to play again. Just a freak play right there between me and Jaylen Brown — happy I was able to walk off under my power.” Elsewhere on Christmas, Jalen Brunson scored a game-high 38 points to lead the New York Knicks to a 129-122 home victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, avenging three head-to-head losses this season. Milwaukee stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard scored 32 points apiece, but the Bucks, probably the biggest threat to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference, had no answers for Brunson and conceded 72 points in the paint. The Denver Nuggets held off the Golden State Warriors, 120-114, in a choppy and over-officiated contest in which Nikola Jokic and Stephen Curry struggled from the field. Jamal Murray scored a game-high 28 points, including back-to-back clutch jumpers in the final four minutes, to lift Denver to its fifth straight win. However, this wasn’t a signature performance for the defending champions, who enter Tuesday as the Western Conference’s No. 2 seed — two games behind  . The Miami Heat built a 21-point lead and held off a Philadelphia 76ers comeback bid for a 119-113 home win, but the contest lacked much relevance with headliners Joel Embiid and Jimmy Butler sidelined with injuries. Heat rookie Jaime Jaquez Jr. led the way with a game-high 31 points, and 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey endured a 4-for-20 shooting night. Injuries to Kyrie Irving and Bradley Beal took some of the luster off the Dallas Mavericks’ 128-114 road victory over the Phoenix Suns in the nightcap, though Luka Doncic turned in Christmas’s best individual performance. The four-time all-star, who previously authored an incredible second-round series victory over the Suns in 2022, finished with 50 points, six rebounds and 15 assists, singlehandedly outscoring Phoenix stars Kevin Durant and Devin Booker combined. Doncic also reached 10,000 career points in his 358th game, surpassing James (368) among active players as the fastest to reach the scoring milestone. Even so, Doncic’s captivating showing came against the reeling Suns, who slipped below .500 with the loss. By the end of an unexpectedly anticlimactic day of basketball, which suffered by comparison to the intensity of the in-season tournament’s knockout round, Boston stood as the clear winner. “A four-game road trip on the West Coast presents different challenges,” Celtics Coach Joe Mazzulla said. “We came out 3-1, and even in our loss we were playing the right brand of basketball on both ends of the floor. It’s not always going to be perfect. We came in with the theme of reinventing our offense as far as off-ball activity and the ability to execute. I thought we did that. I thought we maintained our defensive identity, too. This time of year is about establishing our identity and sticking to it.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/25/nba-christmas-scores-celtics-lakers/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 02:13:00,

Well, look who’s here, in downtown Los Angeles, seated at a little dais amid cameras and phone recorders, at the Rose Bowl semifinal, in the College Football Playoff: It’s an impressive 21-year-old man with an impressive 220-pound body and a budding legacy that includes “benched at South Florida.” Now the path of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe has led all the way from “benched at South Florida” through 10 ensuing wins, through   and through  . If he keeps budding like this, “benched at South Florida” could go all the way from funky to funny. By Monday night, the night No. 4 Alabama plays No. 1 Michigan, 30 quarterbacks will have started in 20 College Football Playoff semifinals. Six will have done so twice, and two will have done so thrice (Jalen Hurts, Trevor Lawrence). Almost all 30 traveled their seasons as the obvious dude. To find something to rival Milroe’s 2023 for in-season impediments, you would have go to one of the two Joneses on the list, Ohio State’s Cardale. That Jones began the summer of 2014 at third string, spent the regular season at second, threw 17 passes in the first 12 games, inherited first string after J.T. Barrett’s injury and soared clear to the closing-Monday-night confetti. Alabama’s year began with four quarterbacks and three official uses of the word “or” between them. Milroe started Alabama’s first two games but not the third. He had a debatable night in Game 2  , then didn’t play in Alabama’s apologetic 17-3 win at South Florida in Tampa. The nation stirred just a little. Commentators commented. Alabama Coach Nick Saban spoke of a general evaluation period and not of any glaring flaws. Milroe handled the middle weekend of September by telling himself, “God makes no mistakes,” he said Thursday here, and also, “I lean on the family acronym ‘Forget About Me, I Love You.’ ” And so: “That was critical when I went into that week. No matter who was in, I prepared the same way, but at the end of the day, when it was an opportunity for someone else to play, I was just trying to be the best teammate I can be.” In a country that evaluates its quarterbacks with irrational haste anymore, it’s a relief to learn setbacks still hold value. “I would describe his path as resilience,” said wide receiver Isaiah Bond, forever bonded with Milroe after catching his 31-yard touchdown pass to win the Iron Bowl. “Could have been a lot of points in the season where a regular person could have showed different sides of themselves. He stayed the same leader, same passion about football. Went out there every single day still loving it. I will say I just show true respect for the way he handled the situation as well.” From there, Milroe returned to the helm, just as Alabama beat Mississippi, 24-10, and the country barely cared. Milroe went from nine touchdown passes and four interceptions across his first five games to 14 touchdown passes and two interceptions across his past seven. He didn’t climb the charts in passing yards per game — his 226.5 rate 46th — but look who’s shining there at No. 4 in passer rating (at 177.48) behind only Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels of LSU, Heisman finalist Bo Nix of Oregon and Kaidon Salter of Liberty. He still runs, including to 12 touchdowns, and his running still carries a hint of Kylian Mbappe in that it can seem to make the ground tremble. He has become the seventh Alabama quarterback to pilot a team to the eight playoff berths and the second Houstonian (after Hurts). His team has leaped from 1-1 to a shaky 2-1 to a reconstructed 12-1. And he still strives at perfecting the art of passing. “Yeah, when you look at me, you don’t think I play quarterback,” he said. “You think I play DB, tight end. You don’t think I play quarterback. Growing up, when I went to camp, they labeled me as a receiver or they saw me as not playing the quarterback position.” That misjudgment appears to have stuck around clear into college, given Milroe’s revelation Thursday that one voice suggesting a position change belonged to former Alabama offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien, nowadays of the New England Patriots. “So who gets the last laugh?” Milroe said. “I beat all odds by playing quarterback,” he said, “and that is something I try to do as much as possible, be an efficient quarterback, be the best version of myself playing the position. … I think passing is the biggest thing because, as a quarterback, it’s a lot of elements of your game that need to be clicking. Number one is playing quarterback — throwing the football because the ball can get there quicker than my legs can.” That’s questionable if you ever see him run, of course, but as he reminded: “In the offseason, I do zero running. All I do is throw the ball. That’s something that I train to do.” And at two urgent late-season moments, his passing thrived. One came   against No. 1 Georgia, which had just crept within 20-17 with 10:16 left and had just loosed its fans into loud delirium as the band played and even the clarinets looked scary. Alabama started at its own 25-yard line. Up the field it went in nine plays with Milroe’s aplomb and polish and 5-for-5 passing behind a grown-up offensive line. All five passes went to Bond, a feat of know-how stirring even if four of the passes, including one shovel of improvisation, were short. What preceded them the previous Saturday wasn’t short. It was, of course, Milroe’s legend, his fourth-and-31 pass to Bond with 32 seconds left in the Iron Bowl at Auburn. That pass screamed across the southeastern sky. It looked as if it might develop contrails. “It looked like money,” Bond said of that ball in flight. It became a flashing light on the path from benched at South Florida to bright lights here. It got Milroe across the country in more ways than one, to saying of his path, “I think the biggest thing was embracing ‘hard.’ ” Even old South Florida wound up 7-6 with a 45-0 bowl win against Syracuse. And there went Bond to a new realm of recognition, realized during his visit to a subsequent Alabama basketball game, where he became deluged with football-addled Crimson humanity. “That was like my first, I would say, big-time moment,” Bond said, but he didn’t adore it. “I’m more reserved, a to-myself type of person.” He had to leave — the premises. “Yes,” he said, “because it was interrupting the game. The game going on, it’s like a hundred people in line trying to take a picture. And I’m on the court. It was kind of distracting to the game. ‘I’m going to get out of here before it gets bigger’ ” — and even further away from benched at South Florida.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/jalen-milroe-alabama-playoff/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 05:00:00,

"NORTH CONWAY, N.H. —   on Thursday scrambled to quell a firestorm that rocked her ascendant presidential campaign, acknowledging the Civil War was “about slavery” after critics in both parties admonished her for omitting that fact during a recent town hall. First during a radio interview then again later during a campaign stop, Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor who has risen in polls of the Republican race, made remarks that departed from what she said a day earlier. When asked about the cause of the war at a Wednesday town hall, she made no mention of slavery, which scholars agree was central to the conflict. That initial exchange attracted widespread attention and criticism in both parties that continued Thursday. NORTH CONWAY, N.H. —   on Thursday scrambled to quell a firestorm that rocked her ascendant presidential campaign, acknowledging the Civil War was “about slavery” after critics in both parties admonished her for omitting that fact during a recent town hall. First during a radio interview then again later during a campaign stop, Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor who has risen in polls of the Republican race, made remarks that departed from what she said a day earlier. When asked about the cause of the war at a Wednesday town hall, she made no mention of slavery, which scholars agree was central to the conflict. That initial exchange attracted widespread attention and criticism in both parties that continued Thursday. “Of course, the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That’s unquestioned. Always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery,” Haley said at a town hall in North Conway. “But it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government. For 80 years, America had the decision and the moral question of whether slavery was a good thing. And whether government economically, culturally, any other reasons, had a role to play in that. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more.” “I say that as a Southerner. I say that as a Southern governor who removed the Confederate flag off the State House grounds,” she added to applause. The outcry over her comments and the attempt to clarify them marked a new test for Haley, who until this week had made few unforced errors and rarely veered off script as she pitched herself as the strongest general election candidate in the field. Her remarks came amid a year-end push in New Hampshire, a state that is seen as key to her chances in the GOP race and where she has shot up into a distant second against  , the clear polling leader. They presented a fresh opportunity for rival campaigns and critics, who have   of trying to have it both ways on key issues. At a presidential campaign event in Iowa on Thursday, Florida Gov.  , a rival Republican, said Haley “had some problems with some basic American history,” calling her response to the Civil War question an “incomprehensible word salad.” “I just think that this shows this is not a candidate that’s ready for prime time,” the governor said, adding that it’s “not that difficult to identify and acknowledge the role slavery played in the Civil War.” . After a white supremacist killed nine people attending Bible study at a historically Black church in Charleston in 2015, Haley signed legislation removing the Confederate flag from the State House grounds. In 2010, she had suggested that she would not make such a move and was well equipped to challenge an NAACP boycott of the state over the flag because of her status as a woman of color. Haley has shown particular strength among centrist and independent voters who play an outsize role in New Hampshire and she has focused heavily on pointing to polls showing her performing well against  . But on Thursday, she was looking to move past a difficult chapter. “I want to nip it in the bud. Yes, we know the Civil War was about slavery. But more than that, what’s the lesson in all this? That freedom matters,” Haley said on “The Pulse of NH,” a local radio show. “And individual rights and liberties matter for all people. That’s the blessing of America. That was a stain on America when we had slavery. But what we want is [to] never relive it, never let anyone take those freedoms away again.” The response she offered Wednesday evening did not include slavery. “What was the cause of the United States Civil War?” a man asked Haley at a town hall in Berlin, N.H. She replied, “Well, don’t come with an easy question.” Then she proceeded to answer. “I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how government was going to run, the freedoms and what people could and couldn’t do,” Haley said. “I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are,” Haley added. “And I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn’t need to tell you how to live your life. They don’t need to tell you what you can and can’t do. They don’t need to be a part of your life.” The questioner expressed surprise at Haley’s response, saying, “In the year 2023, it’s astonishing to me that you answer that question without mentioning the word ‘slavery.’” “What do you want me to say about slavery?” Haley asked. The man responded, “You’ve answered my question, thank you.” Haley quickly drew criticism over the Wednesday exchange from all sides — including  and some rival Republican presidential   and their allies. “It was about slavery,” Biden   on X, formerly Twitter. Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting DeSantis, joked about “New Nikki Haley merch,” sharing a spoof image of shirts featuring her response to the town hall attendee: “What do you want me to say about slavery?” DeSantis has also faced blowback to his approach to race and the history of slavery and discrimination in the United States. His administration  , objecting to some of its content, and was widely criticized for slavery education standards that called for instruction on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” DeSantis   and said they were misconstrued. Former New Jersey governor  , a Republican candidate who has cast himself as the unfiltered truth-teller in the race while castigating Trump as unfit for the White House, said Haley’s Wednesday answer was a reflection of her unwillingness to speak hard truths. He argued that Haley knows the history of her state and doesn’t “have a racist bone in her body.” “So don’t get confused about what she’s been saying and what she and her new political husband [New Hampshire Gov.] Chris Sununu are trying to mop up all around New Hampshire,” Christie, who is competing for moderate and independent voters who have also gravitated toward Haley, said during a town hall Thursday night in Epping, N.H. “She did it because she’s unwilling to offend anyone by telling the truth.” MAGA Inc., the super PAC backing Trump, echoed in an email blast that the comment showed Haley is “not ready for prime time” and said the “issue is her response, not the question.” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who is Black and has endorsed Trump, said slavery was the obvious answer and wrote on X, “This really doesn’t matter because Trump is going to be the nominee.” Trump’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Speaking with reporters Thursday afternoon, Haley dismissed her opponents’ assertions that she had flip-flopped on the cause of the Civil War. She said she didn’t mention slavery in her initial response because she thought it was “a given.” “If it requires clarification of saying, ‘Yes, the Civil War was about slavery,’ I’m happy to do that,” she added. Sununu, who recently   Haley and stood behind her during the conversation with reporters, said her response was “spot on.” After the Wednesday event, some attendees told The Washington Post that they thought Haley answered the question to the best of her ability and they accused the man who asked the question of intending to cause trouble. Vickie Plourde, who said she was undecided before the event, said she had been persuaded to vote for Haley after the town hall. She said the question was a setup. “We have to move past that,” she said of slavery. “If we continue to look in the past and say ‘Look, look, look, look,’ and we’re not moving forward, we’re going to stay back there.” Ahead of Haley’s town hall in North Conway on Thursday, Bill Anderson, who plans to vote for Haley and has donated to her campaign, said he didn’t hold it against her that she didn’t mention slavery. “I don’t expect her to be perfect,” he said. Haley’s past comments on the Civil War have come under scrutiny. As she was running for governor in 2010, she addressed the Civil War during a private meeting with two leaders of Confederate heritage groups. She called it a fight between “tradition” and “change.” “You see passions on different sides,” she said at the time, during comments that were captured on video and  . “I don’t think anyone does anything out of hate.” Christie referenced some of her 2010 remarks Thursday. “I’m sure Nikki will see this — so I want to talk directly to her. The Civil War was not a choice between change and tradition. It was a choice between right and wrong and that’s it. And we’ve got to stand on the side of right,” he said to applause. Fergus Cullen, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party and a vocal critic of Trump, said Thursday that while Haley’s fumbled answer could spur criticism and negative ads, many voters intent on picking a non-Trump candidate have few viable options and would probably stick with her. “Where else do the Not Again Trump voters go?” he asked. When Haley called on a voter to ask a question during a Thursday evening town hall in Lebanon, N.H., the man held up his ballot and told Haley he is trying to decide between her or Christie, but he said he wanted to hear her say she’ll categorically rule out being Trump’s vice president, telling her, “this is your chance to redeem yourself” after the Civil War answer the night before. “I could say what you categorically want to hear and you could go check that box and go do whatever, but I’m going to continue to tell you my truth,” she said, adding that she doesn’t play for second. He shouted at her that she didn’t answer his question, but she moved on to the next one.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/28/nikki-haley-slavery-civil-war-cause-answer/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 20:29:00,
"The Rev. Robert Screen remembers working as a chaplain at a local Fort Washington hospital and hearing the screams of families who lost someone in a crash on notorious Maryland Route 210. “Piercing screams reverberate through the whole hospital,” Screen said as he stood with a microphone in hand at a Prince George’s arts center. “It gets in your bone marrow; it doesn’t leave.” The Rev. Robert Screen remembers working as a chaplain at a local Fort Washington hospital and hearing the screams of families who lost someone in a crash on notorious Maryland Route 210. “Piercing screams reverberate through the whole hospital,” Screen said as he stood with a microphone in hand at a Prince George’s arts center. “It gets in your bone marrow; it doesn’t leave.” Screen, along with other members of the 210 Traffic Safety Committee, joined Prince George’s County and state leaders and residents on Wednesday to once again push for a safer Route 210, also known as   — one of the deadliest highways in the Washington area. This time, they are advocating legislation that would increase the electronic speed monitoring fine, which is currently limited to $40. Next year’s coming legislative session will mark the third consecutive year the bill will be introduced in the Maryland General Assembly, Screen said. The bill is meant to target “super speeders” and “repeat speeders,” said Ron Weiss, a member of the 210 Traffic Safety Committee. Currently, there are three warning signs to alert there is a speed camera, with the last sign showing the rate of speed, Weiss said. The $40 fine is triggered after exceeding the speed limit by 12 mph, and then increases based on speed, according to the  . Traveling at speeds over 107 mph could result in a fine of up to $530. Repeat violators, those who compile multiple infractions within two years, face added civil penalties of upward of $350, according to the bill. “Lawful drivers are unaffected by this bill,” Weiss said. Indian Head Highway, a busy thoroughfare, starts near Charles County and extends to the Capital Beltway. This year, a camera recorded a car traveling 170 mph in a 55-mph zone, according to the safety committee. As of Dec. 16, Prince George’s County police officers have conducted more than 1,107 traffic stops on Route 210 and issued 2,470 citations or warnings, according to the department. There were 11,786 citations issued from speed cameras to repeat offenders from Jan. 1, 2020 to Aug. 21, 2023, according to the safety committee. Two people have been killed in crashes on the highway, within Prince George’s County’s jurisdiction, this year, county police said. According to the safety committee, there have been 91 fatalities since 2007 on what some in the area have dubbed the “Highway of Death.” According to AAA Mid-Atlantic, Indian Head Highway has seen “way too many traffic deaths” throughout the years. “Given the number of traffic fatalities on that stretch of road and the continuing problem with high speeds, AAA is supportive of higher fines. Hopefully, it will serve as a deterrent for reckless and aggressive drivers and result in reduced speeds and less carnage on the roadway,” Ragina Cooper Ali, public and government affairs manager at AAA Mid-Atlantic, said in a statement. County efforts for a safer Route 210 have a long history. Five years ago, Del. Kris Valderrama (D-Prince George’s) spearheaded the state legislation that passed and led the county to install a   along the route. This year, she introduced a bill for more speed cameras after construction zone cameras were taken down, which also passed, she said. There are currently three cameras on the 13-mile roadway, and three additional mobile cameras will be placed, Screen said. Wednesday’s news conference was intended to rally the community in support of the legislation to increase fines ahead of next year’s session. County leaders, including Prince George’s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D), County Council member Calvin S. Hawkins II (D-At Large) and Del. Jamila J. Woods (D-Prince George’s), attended the event and encouraged people to show up in Annapolis to champion the bill. “The current $40 fine has not kept up with the cost of living. It was instituted over almost two decades ago … with no penalty for nonpayment, leaving many motorists to simply ignore the posted signs repeatedly,” Valderrama said. If passed, the increased fines would mirror tickets police officers issue during a traffic stop, Valderrama said. She also said speed cameras are not a “commuter tax,” as some opponents might say. “It is a citation,” she said. Alsobrooks spoke of her news conference in 2019, where she called for safety measures on Indian Head Highway following a fatal   that killed three children just before the new year. “I will repeat what I said here almost five years ago. … I don’t care what we legislate until we change the hearts of people, convince our neighbors and friends that our lives matter,” Alsobrooks said. “And that you don’t have the right to travel on our roadways in a way that presents a danger to other people. … We have to decide that this is important, and we do so by holding people accountable.” Some community members voiced their concerns that fines won’t be enough to deter speeding drivers. Valderrama said, “We have to start somewhere.” Kenniss Henry, 75, who has advocated traffic safety across the state since her daughter  , a third law-year student and Green Party candidate for U.S. Senate, was struck and killed by a driver in 2010 elsewhere in the county, said this bill moves traffic safety forward. “Every time we can get a change to the law that does something to protect our people, it’s a good thing,” Henry said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/23/indian-head-highway-speed-fines/,Washington Post,2023-12-23 06:00:00,

They could still turn to Joey Meneses, who played sparingly at first last season after a breakout 2022 season. At MLB’s winter meetings this month, Manager Dave Martinez said Meneses had been limited by a knee injury in 2023 but he expected him to play first more in the coming year.

And he has shown flashes of power, hitting 12 home runs in 76 games during his rookie season in 2022. Díaz is a strong defender who could enter in late-game situations for Meneses if needed, but he projects as a depth piece with Class AAA Rochester until he can show that he can hit at the big league level.

LONDON — One of the youngest pro-democracy activists to have been sentenced in Hong Kong under a national security law imposed by China has fled to Britain, where he said he will seek asylum. Tony Chung, who in an interview described attempted brainwashing while incarcerated and arbitrary rules imposed on him even after his release, is the latest high-profile Hong Kong activist to leave the city in violation of restrictions on overseas travel. Chung told authorities he was planning a trip to Okinawa in Japan for vacation and promised to return to Hong Kong. Earlier this month, Agnes Chow, another democracy activist, announced she had left Hong Kong for Canada in violation of her bail conditions and would probably not return for the rest of her life. The continued exodus of young activists — despite attempts by the Hong Kong authorities to compel their loyalty — underscores the deterioration of freedoms in a city meant to be autonomous from mainland China. The Hong Kong government has continued to claim that the city’s rights and freedoms are   after passage of the national security law. Chung joins a growing number of exiled Hong Kongers who hope to continue exerting pressure on Beijing over the loss of political freedom in Hong Kong, despite cash bounties offered by city authorities for the arrest of 13 overseas activists. “I have always believed that Hong Kong is the only home of our nation, we shouldn’t be the ones leaving,” Chung said in a statement. But he said the trauma of his arrest, detention and continued surveillance has left him feeling “immense pressure and fear,” which compelled him to leave. A duty officer from the public relations wing of the Hong Kong Police Force said in an emailed statement that “some individuals who have committed crimes endangering national security openly violated supervision orders or bail conditions and fled Hong Kong, completely betraying trust and integrity.” “Not only have they failed to reflect on the harms they have caused to Hong Kong and members of the public, but they have also shamefully begged for assistance from foreign anti-China forces under the guise of being victims,” the statement added. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London urged the U.K. to bring Chung “to justice as soon as possible and repatriate him to Hong Kong.” Chung, 22, was just a teenager when he became involved in politics. He co-founded Studentlocalism, a group that advocated for Hong Kong to be independent from China, a red line for the Chinese Communist Party. In  , Chung said he came to believe independence was “the only way” to achieve self-rule and democracy for Hong Kong. The political position was fringe at the time and continues to be so even though it gained some traction during mass protests in 2019. Studentlocalism dissolved before the national security law came into force in June 2020. Though the authorities promised the security law would not be used retroactively, Chung was among the first arrested under suspicion of inciting “secession.” He was initially released on bail. Chung, whose passport was confiscated, decided to seek protection at the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong. He knew it was a long shot, having looked up laws that spell out how asylum is granted once someone is on U.S. soil, but he was desperate. Such an attempt was not unprecedented — two Chinese dissidents had been granted protection by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing in 1989 and 2012. Chung never made it to the consulate gates. As he was alighting from a taxi across the road from the consulate in late October 2020, Chung saw several men watching him. The men turned out to be undercover police officers who detained him. “I was completely broken,” Chung said of his mental state at the time. “I couldn’t really think.” Chung said felt he had no choice but to plead guilty to the charges against him. He was sentenced in November 2021 to three years and seven months in prison. His alleged crimes, as detailed by prosecutors, involved no violence — only Facebook posts and other political speech. The judge presiding over the case said the sentence was needed to  While in detention, Chung was made to participate in a deradicalization program aimed at changing his beliefs and that of other young prisoners arrested for political crimes. The program was compulsory, he said. Chung confirmed details about the program previously reported by The Washington Post, such as mandatory history lessons that showcase China’s achievements. Guards “kept telling us that the United States government is really bad and that we had been manipulated by the United States,” Chung said. “We felt like we had to agree with them, that we couldn’t disagree or argue back” for fear of punishment, he added. Chung was eventually released in June 2023, his time reduced for good behavior. One week before he was due to be released, police from the national security division visited him and warned him not to continue any activities related to “splitting” China, to keep a low profile and not to leave Hong Kong for a year. Conditions of the order included not posting or saying anything that would harm Hong Kong’s national security — a wide-ranging and unclear restriction — and not speaking publicly. Authorities also prevented him from taking up a temporary job he had secured as a waiter in a restaurant, Chung said, stating without explanation that he could not work in that specific business. Without the job, Chung struggled financially. Amid those difficulties, national security officers proposed he work as a paid informant. Chung provided some basic updates and photos pertaining to people of interest to the police, fulfilling the “minimum requirements” of the police, he said, and was paid a fee. Since  Chung’s release, officials from Hong Kong’s Correctional Services Department have requested meetings every two to four weeks, summoning  him to random locations and then transporting him to undisclosed places in a seven-seater van, its curtains drawn shut. Chung said that during those encounters, he was interrogated about his activities over the previous weeks, asked to provide the names of  elementary school classmates as well as “detailed information about his visits to restaurants and bars, along with contents of [his] conversations.” In one meeting this September, officers asked him if he’d be willing to travel to mainland China, where they could arrange a tour for him. Chung replied that would go only if his safety was guaranteed. Officers did not bring up the proposal again. Chow, the activist who left Hong Kong in early December, said on an Instagram post   she was brought to the mainland on such a tour, and was made to visit the headquarters of a Chinese technology company and attend an exhibition showcasing China’s rapid economic development — part of an apparent effort, she said, to convince her she should support the Chinese system. Chung said he considered other potential destinations to seek asylum, including the United States and Canada, but felt his chances were highest in Britain. He  convinced his minders that he wanted to travel to Okinawa for a vacation over Christmas, saying he needed to “emotionally adjust” to life outside detention. Chung submitted a full travel itinerary, including his flight and accommodation details, and the National Security Department approved the trip. Once in Okinawa, Chung bought a plane ticket from Okinawa to Britain before his deadline to return to Hong Kong. Chung plans to continue his studies and says he will contribute everything he can in exile, “just as before.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/28/hong-kong-security-law-asylum/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 10:06:00,
"A group of Virginia state lawmakers voted Monday in favor of a deal to bring the Washington Capitals and Wizards to a new arena in Northern Virginia, according to four people with knowledge of the situation. Under the plan, which would still require approval from the full General Assembly and local officials, both teams would move to a new facility anchoring a massive mixed-use development in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood, according to three of those people and four others. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the plan. A Virginia stadium authority would own the larger complex and lease it to Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Capitals and the Wizards. A group of Virginia state lawmakers voted Monday in favor of a deal to bring the Washington Capitals and Wizards to a new arena in Northern Virginia, according to four people with knowledge of the situation. Under the plan, which would still require approval from the full General Assembly and local officials, both teams would move to a new facility anchoring a massive mixed-use development in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood, according to three of those people and four others. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the plan. A Virginia stadium authority would own the larger complex and lease it to Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the Capitals and the Wizards. Monumental has not definitively said whether it would move the pro teams to Virginia. If the deal went forward, the company would put hundreds of millions of its own dollars into the project, according to two people briefed on the matter. The deal, if ultimately approved, would constitute a major economic development win for Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) after his party’s losses in last month’s state elections. It could also be a step in Monumental owner Ted Leonsis taking the company public — a move he   in an interview with Bloomberg over the summer. And while the plan would supercharge development in a part of Alexandria that is newly accessible by Metro, it could amount to a crushing blow to D.C.’s  . District officials have been in talks with Monumental over renovating the Capitals’ and Wizards’ home at Capital One Arena as they attempt to revitalize the surrounding area. The arena, built in 1997, is one of the older facilities in the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association. Monumental   in public funds for a major renovation, but D.C. is also juggling   with requests from pro sports owners and looming competition over the future site of the next Commanders stadium. “Monumental Sports & Entertainment is committed to delivering the best fan experience, winning championships, giving back to our communities, and becoming the most valuable regional sports and entertainment enterprise in the world so that we can continue to reinvest in our fans and community,” a Monumental spokesperson wrote in a statement before the vote. “Our commitment to the DMV is unwavering and we look forward to sharing plans for future investments.” A spokeswoman for D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) sent a statement from the mayor’s office before the vote: “Mayor Bowser and [D.C. Council] Chairman [Phil] Mendelson have worked together closely, and in lockstep, to put forward a strong proposal to Monumental Sports, and after several months of negotiations, we are committed to seeing this through as a vital component of DC’s Comeback.” A representative for the Virginia Economic Development Partnership did not respond to requests for comment Monday. A spokeswoman for Youngkin’s office and a spokeswoman for the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership both declined to comment. It is unclear when the deal with Virginia would be announced after getting the green light. The state’s Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission, which is made up of a dozen state lawmakers,  voted on the proposal late Monday afternoon, according to three people with knowledge of the plans. The vote was unanimous, according to two of those people. Proceedings for the commission are private under an exemption in state code because it works on economic development deals. One person on the body moved to recommend that Virginia pursue “Project Potter” and that next year’s General Assembly consider “further details of the incentive package” for “an entertainment-anchored mixed-use development,” according to public documents regarding the meeting. Additional approvals would be required from the Alexandria City Council and the full General Assembly for the plan to fully advance. Alexandria Mayor Justin M. Wilson (D) declined to comment Monday but said the city was “bullish” about economic development in Potomac Yard. A person who was briefed said the development would feature a basketball and hockey facility as part of a larger complex that would also include a “huge” underground parking area and a separate, smaller concert venue. The person described an artist’s rendering as a “little mini-city development” and said it would be built on land owned by the real estate developer JBG Smith. A spokeswoman for JBG Smith declined to comment Monday. A Virginia stadium authority would borrow from Wall Street to pay for the project and pay that money back later. The creation of the stadium authority would allow the developer to leverage state and municipal bond rates — which are well below market rate — to finance construction. State lawmakers would need to vote to create the stadium authority, which would issue bonds and collect tax revenue to pay them down. Revenue generated on things like ticket sales would be used to pay back the bonds. Such an arrangement probably means that the cost to taxpayers would not be entirely clear until the stadium authority determines what kind of rate it could get on the bonds. Capital One Arena could still host concerts and college basketball games if Monumental’s deal with Virginia goes forward. Leonsis’s business has also significantly expanded into neighboring Gallery Place as it has “outgrown” the arena; the company plans to open a TV studio for Monumental Sports Network there in early 2024. For years, Leonsis has grumbled about having a mortgage with unfavorable terms on Capital One Arena, which in 2016 he estimated cost him . He called it “the worst building deal in professional sports” and suggested that he could leave the city when he paid off the mortgage. Two D.C. Council members, Mendelson (D) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), have championed retaining Monumental instead of attracting the Washington Commanders to the RFK Stadium site because the arena hosts far more events than an NFL stadium would and drives more economic activity downtown. Leonsis has in recent years complained about the area around Capital One Arena and the city’s lack of investment in the building as his relationship with Bowser has worsened. He was particularly bothered by buskers playing loud music outside his office. Moving to the Virginia site could offer Monumental more opportunities for non-sports revenue than it is afforded in the District. Franchise owners across professional sports have taken note of the Atlanta Braves’ move to suburban Cobb County, Ga., where the team developed an entertainment district around its new ballpark, making that site a destination and turning the whole complex into a moneymaker. Monumental would have a more than 30-year lease on the Alexandria property, according to two people familiar with discussions around the project. The complex’s concert venue would be on par with D.C.’s Anthem, which can hold up to 6,000 people. Leonsis’s teams can leave D.C. as early as 2027. The arena has a ground lease — meaning Monumental owns the arena and the city owns the land below it. In 2007,  , then-arena owner Abe Pollin exercised two 10-year options to extend the lease from its original end date, 2027, to 2047. But if the bond on the lease is paid in full — and Monumental is allowed to pay the remaining principal in a lump sum — the lease extensions would be nullified, meaning the end date would revert to 2027. Earlier this year, the remaining principal was $35 million. Virginia is the largest state in the country without a major league sports franchise,   that politicians and sports fans alike have bemoaned as they’ve sought to attract teams. Over the years, Virginia has been willing to offer large financial packages for sports facilities but has lost out to D.C. on venues like Nationals Park, Entertainment and Sports Arena in Congress Heights, and D.C. United’s Audi Field. A plan to lure the Commanders to a new stadium and entertainment complex in Virginia enjoyed support early last year from Youngkin and leaders of both parties in the General Assembly, who were initially prepared to forfeit about $1 billion in state tax revenue on the project. But the plan fell apart amid concerns about the cost, the impact on traffic and numerous scandals swirling around the team’s then-owner, Daniel Snyder. A deal with Monumental could help Youngkin turn the page on   he suffered in General Assembly elections last month,   for his conservative agenda and a potential last-minute 2024 presidential bid. Saddled with an all-blue state legislature for his remaining two years in office, he will need to focus on broadly popular economic development projects and other bipartisan priorities to get any wins out of the Capitol. This is not the first time Virginia state officials have sought to bring a professional sports stadium to Potomac Yard, a former rail hub in Alexandria that has for decades been eyed as a prime target for redevelopment. Plans   to put a football stadium there in the 1990s amid intense local opposition, giving way to a mix of apartment buildings and big-box stores just south of Reagan National Airport. The arrival of   in nearby Arlington County — and a   served by the Blue and Yellow lines — has accelerated efforts to further build out the Alexandria neighborhood. Local officials have promoted the area, where Virginia Tech is building a graduate engineering campus, as part of the larger tech district  “National Landing.” JBG Smith is also working on that billion-dollar “innovation campus,” which was a key part of the package to win over Amazon and is set to open the   next fall. The company has   some plans to construct residential buildings on the remainder of the area, once the site of a movie theater. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and the newspaper’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on Amazon’s board.) Alexandria lawmakers in 2010 voted to approve a   that envisions carving the neighborhood up into a street grid of smaller blocks, including a mixed-use entertainment district that would bring people to the area near the Metro in the evening. An arena and adjacent complex would probably accelerate redevelopment in the entire area. JBG Smith in 2019   that it intends to redevelop a strip mall west of Virginia Tech and replace it with 13 new mixed-use buildings, potentially including a hotel. Any effort to bring a new sports arena to Potomac Yard is likely to draw fierce opposition from some homeowners in nearby low-density neighborhoods like Del Ray, a former bedroom community for rail yard workers now better known for its charming strip of small, independent businesses. Some residents in Del Ray — where quaint bungalows now sell in the high six figures — have   vociferously against city lawmakers’ votes to add more development in Alexandria in recent years. The Monumental project would almost certainly divide residents between those who see the project as a threat to their city’s small-town sensibility and those who support additional amenities and a boost to the city’s sagging finances. The only concern at the moment for lawmakers is transportation and transit along Route 1, according to two people. The General Assembly would need to approve funding for traffic-calming measures and other road improvements. State officials are considering a plan to lower a segment of Route 1 — which connects Potomac Yard with downtown D.C. — from an elevated highway into a flattened “urban boulevard,” and a new arena would be all but certain to add to traffic in an area that already experiences heavy gridlock.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/11/monumental-sports-capitals-wizards-alexandria-virginia-capital-one-arena/,Washington Post,2023-12-11 20:37:00,
"Monumental Sports & Entertainment owner Ted Leonsis and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) will appear together Wednesday at an event in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard area, according to multiple people familiar with the details, suggesting that a plan to build a new arena there for the Washington Capitals and Wizards is close to a formal announcement. Monumental Sports & Entertainment owner Ted Leonsis and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) will appear together Wednesday at an event in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard area, according to multiple people familiar with the details, suggesting that a plan to build a new arena there for the Washington Capitals and Wizards is close to a formal announcement. Monumental has not definitively said whether it would move the Capitals and Wizards across the Potomac River. But news of the joint appearance by Leonsis and Youngkin prompted D.C. officials to make an 11th-hour attempt to keep both teams downtown. The Wednesday event with the team owner and governor was confirmed by seven people, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions. The joint appearance comes as District officials have been in talks with Leonsis over renovations to the Capitals’ and Wizards’ current home at Capital One Arena downtown. Late Tuesday, after news of the event was reported, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced an 11th-hour bill with Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) that, if passed, would offer Monumental, which owns the Capitals and Wizards, $500 million in financing toward the rehabilitation of Capital One Arena as well as an extension of its ground lease until the end of 2052. Monumental   in public funds for a major renovation of the arena, and some D.C. officials have framed that project as key to revitalizing the struggling downtown around the facility. But Bowser said in a statement that the bill represented D.C.’s “best and final offer.” The tentative proposal drafted between Virginia and Monumental, which requires additional approval from state and local lawmakers, would move the Capitals and Wizards to a new facility anchoring a much larger mixed-use development in Alexandria. Tents were visible near the Potomac Yard Metro station Tuesday evening in advance of Wednesday’s event. If the plan with Virginia moves forward, both the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League teams would relocate to a new facility in Alexandria, according to seven people familiar with negotiations over the plan, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details. The District which is facing severe  , is also juggling looming competition over the future site of the next Commanders football stadium and requests from the Washington Nationals baseball team for upgrades. Bowser’s bill authorizes a development agreement between her office and Monumental in which the company would receive $167 million in public funds per year between 2024 and 2026. Bowser said the bill had the backing of the full D.C. Council. “Mr. Leonsis and Monumental Sports have been critical partners in keeping our downtown thriving, especially after the pandemic,” the mayor said in a statement. “The modernization of the Capital One Arena will be an invaluable investment for continued success and our future prosperity.” She added that the bill “is the next step in partnering with Monumental Sports to breathe new life and vibrancy into the neighborhood and to keep the Washington Wizards and the Washington Capitals where they belong — in Washington D.C.” Mendelson said in an interview that he and Bowser met with Leonsis on Tuesday morning to discuss a presentation that the two D.C. leaders had shared with him on Sunday. The pitch included the $500 million offer, pledged to ramp up security in the area and envisioned turning the Gallery Place-Chinatown neighborhood into an “entertainment epicenter.” While Mendelson described Leonsis as “impressed” by the presentation, the D.C. leaders also learned of Virginia’s announcement Wednesday morning, causing Mendelson and Bowser to leave the meeting in agreement to accelerate drafting the legislation. But the city’s proposal may be too late. One person who was briefed on the Alexandria deal said a Virginia stadium authority would own the larger mixed-use complex and lease it to Monumental. The “little mini-city development” would also include a smaller concert venue and a “huge” underground parking area, that person said. It would be built on land owned by real estate developer JBG Smith. The state’s Major Employment and Investment Project Approval Commission, which is made up of a dozen Virginia lawmakers, voted unanimously Monday afternoon to approve the plan, according to two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Any deal between the state and Monumental would require additional approval from the full General Assembly and the Alexandria City Council. A spokeswoman for Youngkin did not respond to requests for comment. Leonsis has for several years complained about having a mortgage with unfavorable terms on Capital One Arena, which in 2016 he estimated cost him . He called it “the worst building deal in professional sports” and suggested that he could leave the city when he paid off the mortgage. The arena, built in 1997, is one of the older facilities in the NHL and the NBA. It could still host concerts and college basketball games if Monumental’s deal with Virginia goes forward. Monumental also owns the WNBA’s Mystics, who play at a different arena in Southeast Washington. The Federal City Council, a nonprofit business and civic group that has worked with Bowser’s office on downtown recovery efforts, said losing the Capitals and Wizards would be “a blow to DC greater than the sporting events we lose.” “A thriving downtown has driven our economy and tax base,” Anthony Williams, the group’s CEO and a former mayor, said in a statement. “It will be a huge blow to our downtown recovery and all the services it pays for. Capital One Arena has been a big part of D.C.’s comeback story. Downtown is down but not out, and the Arena can be part of our comeback again.” Potomac Yard, a former rail hub that was at one point considered as the site for a football stadium, has long been targeted by Alexandria officials as a potential site for redevelopment. But any arena and adjacent complex would also create pushback from residents in the suburban areas nearby about additional traffic and flooding impacts. Two people familiar with Virginia’s proposal said it includes about $200 million for transportation improvements to support the new arena, though it does not specify what roads would be affected. Both people said there has been conversation over expanding capacity at the Potomac Yard Metro station, including adding a ramp that would connect the station directly to the proposed arena. Youngkin has pitched several House and Senate Democrats on the project, according to two people familiar with his efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations. That outreach — notable for a governor who has not had warm relationships with many Democrats and does not regularly lobby legislators of either party — started immediately after Republicans lost control of the House of Delegates and failed to flip the Senate in the Nov. 7 General Assembly elections, the two people said. With Democrats leading both chambers, Youngkin will need them to pass legislation creating a sports authority to oversee financing of the project and approve the additional transportation funds. Several prominent Democrats declined to comment on the project Tuesday, saying they wanted to wait until Youngkin formally unveils it. But the few who spoke signaled they were not yet on board. “I’ve been told this deal will use no state $$ & no impact on debt capacity of the City of Alex or Virginia. Obviously this is a trust but verify situation, needs to be a true win-win to earn my support,” Del. Marcus B. Simon (D-Fairfax) wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. State Sen. L. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth), incoming chairwoman of the powerful Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, framed the project as a bargaining chip for regional or Democratic priorities. “While some people want sports stadiums … I want tolls to disappear from Hampton Roads *and* I want recreational sale of marijuana,” she tweeted. “Guess we will have to find compromises this session.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/12/monumental-sports-capitals-wizards-alexandria-youngkin-arena/,Washington Post,2023-12-12 22:01:00,
"The Denver Broncos are sitting down quarterback Russell Wilson two games before the end of his second season with the franchise, a provocative move that puts Wilson’s future with the team in doubt. Backup Jarrett Stidham is scheduled to start Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers in Denver, according to a person familiar with the situation. Coach Sean Payton informed members of the organization of the move Wednesday, with the Broncos enduring a frustrating stretch in which they’ve lost three of their past four games. That has dropped their record to 7-8 and has dented their playoff chances considerably in Payton’s first season. The Denver Broncos are sitting down quarterback Russell Wilson two games before the end of his second season with the franchise, a provocative move that puts Wilson’s future with the team in doubt. Backup Jarrett Stidham is scheduled to start Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers in Denver, according to a person familiar with the situation. Coach Sean Payton informed members of the organization of the move Wednesday, with the Broncos enduring a frustrating stretch in which they’ve lost three of their past four games. That has dropped their record to 7-8 and has dented their playoff chances considerably in Payton’s first season. Payton confirmed the move during a news conference later Wednesday. “Most of you know we’ve made a change at quarterback,” he said. “And I understand all the speculation and everything that surrounds a move like that. And I can tell you, look, we’re desperately trying to win. And sure, in our game today, there are economics and all those other things. But the number one push behind this — and it’s a decision I’m making — is to get a spark offensively.” Wilson is the NFL’s seventh-rated passer (98.0) with 26 touchdown passes and eight interceptions. He is one spot ahead of Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, the front-runner for the MVP award. The maneuver could give the Broncos a measure of financial flexibility with Wilson’s contract entering the offseason. Under the deal, a $37 million payment to Wilson becomes fully guaranteed in March. It currently is guaranteed against injury only. By sitting Wilson now, the Broncos may avoid the possibility of him suffering an injury that would guarantee the payment and make it more difficult to trade or release him in the offseason, if they choose to do so. Wilson’s contract would count about $85 million against the Broncos’ salary cap if they were to release him in the offseason, although that could be spread over more than one season. Next season’s salary cap figure has yet to be determined, but this season’s cap was about $224.8 million. “The Broncos went all in on Russell Wilson with trade and financial compensation,” former Green Bay Packers front-office executive Andrew Brandt wrote Wednesday  . “Now it appears they’re all out. And it will cost them.” According to a person familiar with the deliberations between the team and Wilson, the Broncos previously threatened to bench Wilson for the rest of the season if he did not agree to rework his contract to address the injury guarantee. One such exchange took place following the Broncos’ victory Oct. 29 over the Kansas City Chiefs, according to that person. The NFL and the NFL Players Association became involved in the matter, according to that person. The NFL declined to comment through a spokesman. The NFLPA did not respond to a request for comment. The Broncos did not respond to a request for comment on that issue. Payton said during his news conference that the decision to sit Wilson was based on on-field considerations, not on contract-related issues. “We’re trying to win every game we’re playing,” Payton said. “And that’s the case this weekend.” Wilson will serve as the team’s No. 2 quarterback, Payton said. Payton said he met Wednesday morning with Wilson, adding that Wilson was “obviously disappointed.” Payton called the situation “difficult and challenging.” He said the team had not made a decision about Wilson’s status beyond this season. “We need a spark,” Payton said. “We need something right now. We’ll handle the long term when we get there. But we’re not there.” The Broncos traded quarterback Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris and draft choices — two first-round selections, two second-rounders and a fifth-rounder —   in March 2022 for Wilson and a fourth-round draft pick. Wilson was 33 at the time and had established himself as one of the NFL’s biggest stars during his 10 seasons in Seattle, winning a Super Bowl and being selected to the Pro Bowl nine times. Wilson waived a no-trade clause in his contract to facilitate the deal to the Broncos. In September 2022, the Broncos signed Wilson   worth $245 million, including $165 million guaranteed. Wilson had two years and $51 million remaining on his previous deal. The extension, which runs through the 2028 season, put Wilson under contract to the Broncos for seven seasons for a total of $296 million. The new contract came less than a month after NFL team owners   of the Broncos from the Pat Bowlen Trust to a group led by Walmart heir Rob Walton for $4.65 billion. “Our organization is fully committed to winning and competing for Super Bowls with Russell as a Bronco for many years to come,” Greg Penner, the franchise’s chief executive, said in a statement when Wilson’s contract extension was completed. Wilson struggled to a career-low passer rating of 84.4 last season as the Broncos went 5-12. He threw 11 interceptions to go with just 16 touchdown passes. He was sacked a league-high 55 times. The Broncos fired Nathaniel Hackett, their rookie head coach,  . In January, the team  , the Super Bowl-winning former coach of the New Orleans Saints who was out of the league last season, hoping to get Wilson back to franchise quarterback status and to return the team to its winning ways. Payton was publicly critical of Hackett, telling USA Today in July that Hackett may have done “one of the worst coaching jobs in the history of the NFL” while adding that there were “20 dirty hands” involved in Wilson’s poor season. Most QB wins through first 12 seasons of career since the merger Peyton Manning      131 Tom Brady                 124 Russell Wilson         115 Brett Favre                 115 Big Ben                        113  The Broncos got off to a 1-5 start this season, which included a 70-20 defeat to the Miami Dolphins in September. But Payton and Wilson turned things around, and the Broncos climbed back into playoff contention with a five-game winning streak. Wilson, 35, was back to playing much as he did during his Seahawks days. Things have come undone lately, however, and the Broncos suffered a particularly disappointing loss at home Christmas Eve to the New England Patriots. So now they are turning to Stidham, who had a two-game stint as the Las Vegas Raiders’ starter late last season when they sat down Derek Carr in advance of releasing him in February. Carr signed with the Saints and has been their starter this season. “If I didn’t feel like [Stidham] gave us the chance to win,” Payton said, “we wouldn’t be making that move.” Stidham said Payton told him Wednesday morning that he would be the starter this week. “Your goal and objective is to always get out on the field and play,” Stidham said at a news conference. “That’s what my goal has always been. That’s how I’ve always prepared myself.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/27/broncos-bench-russell-wilson/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 18:26:00,
"Meetings are a headache for office workers everywhere. And recently, Joshua Zerkel hit his breaking point. “I was looking at my own calendar, wanting to cry,” he said about the back-to-back meetings that made it difficult to get anything done. So Zerkel, head of global engagement marketing at enterprise work management platform Asana, escalated his concerns about meeting bloat to the head of an internal think tank that researches and offers strategies for making work more efficient. The concerns inspired the lab to try an experiment that temporarily cancels recurring meetings and asks people to rebuild their calendars from scratch. They called it “meetings doomsday.” Meetings are a headache for office workers everywhere. And recently, Joshua Zerkel hit his breaking point. “I was looking at my own calendar, wanting to cry,” he said about the back-to-back meetings that made it difficult to get anything done. So Zerkel, head of global engagement marketing at enterprise work management platform Asana, escalated his concerns about meeting bloat to the head of an internal think tank that researches and offers strategies for making work more efficient. The concerns inspired the lab to try an experiment that temporarily cancels recurring meetings and asks people to rebuild their calendars from scratch. They called it “meetings doomsday.” “It’s definitely better now,” Zerkel said about the experiment. Meeting overload continues to be a big problem for many office workers. In general, 68 percent of people say they don’t have enough uninterrupted focus time during the workday, according to a study Microsoft released this year. Companies scaled up meetings during the height of the   pandemic to stay connected to workers, many of whom were confined to their homes. But years later, even as many people work from the office at least part-time, the overwhelming number of video meetings remains. Some companies have been rethinking their meeting culture and cutting way back to reduce exhaustion and boost productivity. “Right now there’s an all-time-high interest in [fixing] meetings,” said Steven Rogelberg, meetings expert and professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. “There’s recognition that we can do better.” Since February 2020, Microsoft Teams users have three times more meetings and calls per week, the company reported. Workers reported that too many and inefficient meetings were two of the top three obstacles to productivity. To remedy this, Asana, which already had no-meetings Wednesdays, debuted its meetings doomsday experiment. Zerkel’s team of nine was asked to delete all meetings from their calendar, wait two days and then consider which ones needed to be restored. Each participant saved 11 hours per month, said Rebecca Hinds, head of the think tank called the Work Innovation Lab. The small experiment led to a larger 60-person experiment, which ultimately led the lab to release a meetings doomsday playbook that tells teams how to do it for themselves. “The biggest change I’ve seen is more thoughtfulness around scheduling and structuring meetings,” Hinds said, adding that leaders encourage people to decline meetings they don’t consider valuable. “It’s more common to cancel meetings if the agenda is light or if a good majority can be done [at different times].” Shopify, an e-commerce platform, took things further. In January, the company asked employees to cancel all meetings, wait two weeks before adding anything back, and leave Wednesdays clear. As of July, the average time each person spent in meetings was down 14 percent compared to the first five months of last year and the company is on track to ship about 18 percent more projects by the end of the year, the company said. Going further, software firm Techsmith last year did an entire month with no meetings, asking employees to instead collaborate in other ways. Afterward, the company experienced a reduction in standing meetings and an increase in alternate communication forms such as video messaging. Employee surveys showed a 15 percent increase in employees feeling “very productive,” with 85 percent saying they identified meetings they would eliminate or shorten going forward. Meetings became shorter and the number of participants in meetings was also reduced. “The number one benefit is employee well-being,” said CEO Wendy Hamilton. “It’s about protecting the energy of employees so they can do their best work when they’re working.” Other companies say they’re still tweaking their strategy. Zapier, a workflow automation platform, last year opted to institute a focus week. Each employee set a goal and prioritized that work for the entire week. Meetings weren’t banned, but general and recurring meetings were discouraged. Eighty percent of employees said they accomplished their goal, said Chief People Officer Brandon Sammut. Collectively, employees reportedly saved thousands of hours of meeting time that week. Shaking up employees’ normal rhythms also forced them to rethink whether certain meetings were needed. The company now hosts a focus week quarterly. “It opened time on my calendar to get projects done that I couldn’t get done before,” said Danny Schreiber, senior business operations manager, adding that leaders expect workers to share what they accomplished during the week. “It feels really good to not only share what you did, but to hear what other folks did.” Slack similarly officially implemented Maker Week and Focus Fridays in summer of 2022 to allow employees to do heads-down work without interruptions. But the company has also been testing things such as cutting meetings in half and encouraging more breaks, and testing new AI tools in Slack that can summarize meetings and channels to allow people to skip some meetings. “Meetings are often at the root of a lot of problems, so it feels like such a critical problem to solve,” said Christina Janzer, Slack senior vice president of research and analytics. An experiment at Atlassian in September turned into new guidance the company rolled out earlier this month. A group of researchers on the company’s Team Anywhere Lab, which focuses on tackling the biggest challenges associated with distributed work, asked 60 workers to make prescheduled meetings no more than about 30 percent of their week.  They were also asked to block 30 to 40 percent of their week for focus time and avoid instantly responding to inbound messages, limiting that time to 20 percent of the week. Half were asked to reflect on their top priority the next day and design the day around that. Employees reported a 32 percent improvement in focus and 31 percent more progress on top priorities. “Overall, this guidance helped everyone a lot,” said Molly Sands, head of the lab. “They reported less exhaustion, which was really important.” The results were lasting, said Annaliese McGavin, an Atlassian employee who participated in the experiment. McGavin’s team still has meetings, but they’re grouping them together “so we can have bigger chunks for focus time,” she said. Her favorite change was not responding to messages instantly. “It was like a golden ticket,” she said. Of course, these changes have their challenges. Guidance and policies don’t always affect everyone equally (customer service representatives can’t reject meetings as they please, for example). Global time zones can also make it harder to coordinate, cancel or reschedule meetings. Getting everyone to buy in can also be hard. And in some cases, reducing meetings also diminishes the chances less-experienced workers have to learn from watching others. Rogelberg, the professor who advises companies on meeting culture, said the most effective strategies take a top-down and bottom-up approach, giving leaders responsibility for executing the plan and encouraging others to participate and allowing employees to take ownership as a policy gets developed. “When taken together, you shock the system … and change meeting culture,” he said. Zerkel is grateful his work life has changed.

"During one of the early practices at his first preseason camp with the Maryland football team last year, quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. began to lose count of the mistakes he was making. Inaccurate throws and missed reads, among other breakdowns, led to poor body language and shaken confidence for the transfer from Wake Forest. During one of the early practices at his first preseason camp with the Maryland football team last year, quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. began to lose count of the mistakes he was making. Inaccurate throws and missed reads, among other breakdowns, led to poor body language and shaken confidence for the transfer from Wake Forest. Incumbent starter Taulia Tagovailoa took notice, Edwards recalled recently, and instead of allowing the newcomer to wallow further, the program’s most prominent player offered a comforting embrace and words of encouragement. That triggered a bond that grew stronger this year when they were roommates for every road game. A heartfelt conversation between the close friends took on a similar tenor last week when Tagovailoa revealed he would be   to begin preparations for the NFL draft, leaving the starting job to Edwards when the Terrapins face Auburn at 2 p.m. Saturday at Nissan Stadium in Nashville. Maryland (7-5) will be playing in a bowl game for the third straight year — the first time it has done that since 2006 to 2008 — after securing a third consecutive winning record thanks to victories in two of its final three regular season games. A victory over the Tigers (6-6) would deliver a bowl win in three straight seasons for the first time in school history. “I give him a lot of credit from when I came in,” Edwards said of Tagovailoa, the Big Ten leader in career passing yards. “He kind of took me under his wing. I remember my first year here, I was kind of having a rough day, and he put his arm around me. He was like: ‘You’re good, man. Days like this happen.’ … It turned into something we both weren’t expecting, but it’s something I’m very grateful for and will last a lot longer than his time or my time here.” With Tagovailoa’s record-setting career at Maryland over, Edwards gets another crack at leaving a memorable impression on Coach Michael Locksley and the offensive staff as they seek a replacement for a four-year starter who became the foundation of a rebuild. Edwards did so initially in October 2022 when he came off the bench in relief of Tagovailoa, who was   early in the fourth quarter against Indiana. The current redshirt sophomore from Springfield orchestrated a comeback capped by his three-yard touchdown run that produced a 38-33 win on the road. Edwards made the first start of his career the next week in  . He completed 18 of 28 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown without an interception and ran 16 times for 66 yards to help the Terrapins improve to 6-2 and secure bowl eligibility. “They’re kind of different quarterbacks,” said wide receiver Jeshaun Jones, who leads Maryland in receptions (53) and receiving yards (747). “Billy’s a tough guy, very smart, and he’s a great leader as well. I think he brings a lot of the great leader similarities that [Tagovailoa] had, and I think that will roll over with Billy.” Edwards played in seven games this year, all as a reserve, but finished with a team-high six rushing touchdowns, including three covering one yard apiece against then-No. 3 Michigan   on Nov. 18. He became the first Terrapins quarterback with three rushing touchdowns in a game since 2014. Listed at 6-foot-3, Edwards is four inches taller than Tagovailoa and this season embraced his role as the goal-line quarterback, although as a standout at Lake Braddock High he amassed more than 5,000 passing yards and threw for 59 touchdowns. “You do what your quarterback allows you to do,” Locksley said. “We kind of know who Billy is. I think sometimes because of how we use Billy maybe [media members] think that, ‘Oh, Billy’s just a runner,’ but Billy throws the ball really, really well. He’s a traditional pocket quarterback, but he also has some sneaky athleticism that I think catches people off-guard.” But just because Edwards is being presented the opportunity to start Saturday doesn’t mean he will be doing the same when the Terrapins open the 2024 season, according to Locksley, who is vowing to conduct an open competition. Other players in the mix include redshirt freshman Cameron Edge, a four-star high school prospect according to ESPN and 247 Sports, and   and has three years of eligibility remaining. In two years with the Wolfpack, Morris played in nine games, including seven starts, and passed for 1,367 yards with 14 touchdowns and six interceptions. He joined the Terrapins a month after Locksley announced the hiring of former N.C. State director of player personnel Merci Falaise to the same position at Maryland. “Everybody has to earn what they get around here,” Locksley said. “I talk about that a lot, so yeah, nobody’s been promised the starting position. It’s going to be a competitive position. [The] competition probably will go all the way into the summer. … The guy that does the best job of taking care of the football and the driving and scoring leads us out in the first game next year.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/billy-edwards-jr-maryland-football/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 08:00:00,
"The Detroit Pistons are the new owners of one of the NBA’s least coveted records. With a 118-112 home loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday night, the Pistons suffered their 27th consecutive defeat, setting the record for the longest single-season losing streak in NBA history. The 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers, who had lost LeBron James to the Miami Heat the previous summer, and the 2013-14 Philadelphia 76ers, who were just beginning their “Process” rebuilding effort, previously shared the record with 26 straight losses. The Detroit Pistons are the new owners of one of the NBA’s least coveted records.

The 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers, who had lost LeBron James to the Miami Heat the previous summer, and the 2013-14 Philadelphia 76ers, who were just beginning their “Process” rebuilding effort, previously shared the record with 26 straight losses. Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas have come and gone since Detroit’s most recent win, which came Oct. 28 against the Chicago Bulls. Despite a 2-1 start, the Pistons went winless in November, snapped their franchise record of 21 straight losses across the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons earlier this month and now hold the NBA’s worst record at 2-28. The previous team with a worse record through 30 games was the 2015-16 76ers, who started 1-29 (and reached 1-30) before finishing 10-72. If the Pistons lose their next two games — at the Boston Celtics on Thursday and vs. the Toronto Raptors on Saturday — they would claim the NBA’s longest losing streak of all time. The 76ers lost 28 straight games across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. “You have to be real about where we are,” said Pistons Coach Monty Williams, who is in his first season with Detroit. “Nobody wants something like this attached to them. The bottom line is that it’s my job and my responsibility. ... Coaches are graded on their records. That’s the bottom line. ... I’m sure the players don’t want that attached to the name on the jersey. Was it [weighing] heavy [on us]? It’s been heavy for a while. That’s just the nature of this type of losing streak. We’ve got to do what we’ve got to do to change it. ...  “I was brought in here to change this thing. It’s probably the most on me than anybody. The players are playing their hearts out. I’ve got to get them in a position where they don’t feel tight or heavy.” Detroit fought hard to snap its streak against the Nets (15-15), taking a 20-7 lead in the first quarter in front of a hopeful crowd at Little Caesars Arena. But the Nets countered to take a 61-54 lead at halftime and held off a Pistons rally in the fourth quarter. Detroit guard Cade Cunningham scored 37 of his game-high 41 points in the second half and center Jalen Duren posted 12 points and 15 rebounds in his first game back after missing eight with an ankle injury, but it wasn’t enough to avoid infamy. Cunningham, the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft, scored the Pistons’ final 12 points in a desperate flurry, but the Nets’ Cameron Johnson and Dorian Finney-Smith hit dagger three-pointers to seal the victory. “[Cunningham] showed me even more in the locker room just now,” Williams said. “He talked passionately about the things we need to do and how everybody needs to be in the boat and accountable for where we are.” After Nets forward Mikal Bridges missed a pair of free throws with 7.5 seconds left, the Pistons squandered their last possession when Alec Burks sailed a pass out of bounds, prompting boos from the home crowd. “I didn’t sleep very well last night anticipating how tough this game was going to be,” Nets Coach Jacque Vaughn said. “I give our guys an extreme amount of credit to persevere throughout the night. ... After our start, that could easily make you relent, and we didn’t.” In a recent interview, Pistons owner Tom Gores   but said he had no plans to sell the team. Gores, the billionaire founder of the Platinum Equity private equity firm, purchased the Pistons for $325 million in 2011. Detroit has made the playoffs just twice during his tenure, getting swept out of the first round both times. Detroit is on pace to finish 5-77, which would set NBA records for the fewest wins and the lowest winning percentage (.061). “We’ve got to stay together,” Cunningham said. “Right now is the easiest time to stand off and be on your own. We need to continue to lean on each other and continue to push each other and hold each other accountable more than ever now. ... There’s nothing positive about this situation that we put ourselves in, so we’ve got to dig deep and get ourselves out of it. You can’t get away from [the losing streak]. It weighs on us every day, everywhere.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/26/pistons-losing-streak-record/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 22:30:00,

"Maryland lawmakers grappling with multibillion-dollar budget shortfalls are weighing proposals to tax the rich. Levying a “millionaire’s tax,” targeting capital gains income from stock market earnings and broadening the estate tax are among many varied ideas under consideration to raise money for transportation and education, according to several leading Democratic lawmakers. Maryland lawmakers grappling with multibillion-dollar budget shortfalls are weighing proposals to tax the rich. Levying a “millionaire’s tax,” targeting capital gains income from stock market earnings and broadening the estate tax are among many varied ideas under consideration to raise money for transportation and education, according to several leading Democratic lawmakers. “Everything is broadly on the table,” said Senate Budget and Taxation Committee Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard). “I don’t think anything’s off the table,” said House Ways and Means Committee Chair Vanessa Atterbeary (D-Howard). “This is the session to do something if we’re going to do it,” she said of the impending General Assembly session in January. “You know, some folks say, ‘wait till next session.’ I say rip the Band-Aid off, and let’s just solve the problem.” Maryland’s perplexing economic indicators — historically low unemployment but also stagnant growth — have not delivered the revenue needed to fund Democratic lawmakers’ ambitions. And while a flood of federal pandemic aid disguised the underlying problem, the help evaporated and leaders find themselves confronted with the politically fraught prospect of finding new money. A coalition of 30 advocacy groups, the Maryland Fair Funding Coalition, has seized the moment, throwing $250,000 behind ad   during the last few weeks of the year to build public support for changes they say would yield $1.6 billion more annually in revenue. Some liberal county executives who have long sought a tax code that shifted more tax burden to the businesses and the wealthy are advocating for it too. Proposals under consideration by top Democrats vary from a comprehensive top-to-bottom shift of tax burden from the middle class to higher earners and corporations, to piecemeal ideas to tax online poker games or raise fees for government services. The prospect of tax increases are all but certain to land with a thud among Maryland Republicans, who are outnumbered 2 to 1 by Democrats. “We’ve seen that in the past. That doesn’t work,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Queen Anne’s) said, pointing to Great Recession-era policies passed under former governor Martin O’Malley (D) that fueled support for his successor, two-term Republican Larry Hogan, as evidence that discontent about tax increases has consequences. “O’Malley had the millionaire’s tax, and we lost more millionaires to other states,” Hershey said. “They have the capability of relocating and finding better states with better tax policies, whereas most people that will get affected by it don’t have the ability to do that.” House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) said he didn’t expect a quick resolution as lawmakers weigh the alternatives on the table: deep cuts to transportation spending or delaying other policy ambitions. “We have a long session ahead of us, and it’s unclear at the moment where this conversation goes,” Moon said. “Folks are going to have to let the budget cuts — and the transportation budget cuts in particular — sink in as the session winds through and decide if they actually can stomach those sort of cuts.” Moon said “it’s been a delayed conversation because the pandemic dumped enough federal stimulus on us that, you know, I think people forgot what the times of austerity and leaner budgets might look like,” Moon said. “For now, it’s a lot of concern and a lot of unknown about how this story ends.” Tax talks are in early stage, as the Democrats who hold supermajorities in both chambers have not coalesced around a single tax-increase concept, nor sought even an agreement in principle with Gov. Wes Moore (D). Moore’s public comments about the budget problems have focused on growing the economy to close the gap between the ruling party’s ambitions and the state’s balance sheets. He has warned about “discipline” in the upcoming year and having to “say no” to some key priorities. In a  , he warned that Maryland residents tell him they feel like they pay too much in taxes for what they receive in return. This month he laid out   to planned transportation spending, canceling big projects across the state and reducing maintenance for transit programs, as well as hiking parking fees at BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport and reducing the frequency of highway litter pickup. It sparked backlash even among Democratic allies who said the cuts went too far. Meanwhile, the landmark education plan, known as the  , ramps up over the next four years and will eventually offer free public preschool statewide, wraparound services and extra resources in high-poverty areas, among many other initiatives. But despite stashing away some of the   to pay for it, within four years the Blueprint is expected to cost $1.8 billion more than the state has available each year. Several lawmakers and aides said ongoing, behind-the-scenes conversations among top Democrats include more aggressively tax multistate corporations by using the “combined reporting” method, as   do. Another idea proposes adding additional brackets with higher tax rates for households earning over $775,000 a year. Other Democrats are floating more modest ideas such as letting residents play the lottery online. “We’re in a moment where people realize that what we’ve been doing isn’t working, and it’s not been able to ever provide the amount of money Maryland needs for transportation,” Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich (D) said in an interview. Elrich said he wants the legislature to grant local governments the ability to tax commercial and residential properties at different rates, a policy he said would allow Montgomery to raise revenue for transportation without directly hitting homeowners. “We have a system where the middle class gets hammered, and you’ve got massively wealthy companies that pay nothing in taxes. It’s a farce. And, you know, it’s not democratic. It’s not good policy,” he said. Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D), a staunch and outspoken proponent for tax reform, said in an interview he has repeatedly told state lawmakers for years that as they look for a revenue source to pay for the education program, they should go to the top of the income scale to get it. “There is more appetite than there’s ever been to make our tax structure more progressive to get revenue,” Pittman said. Maryland’s state budget problems involve more than transportation and education shortfalls. More broadly, a recent   forecast revenue to grow by 3.3 percent over the next four years while planned spending grows by 4.8 percent. In a statement to The Post, Moore spokesman Carter Elliott IV said the governor “is committed to exploring any and all options in collaboration with the dedicated leaders of the state legislature.” The statement did not directly answer whether Moore supported placing more of the tax burden on wealthy residents and corporations, but it said he wanted “to invest in evidenced-backed policies that drive economic growth and good-paying jobs, ensure the education of Maryland’s children, and make our communities safer, all while making life a little easier for families struggling to keep up.” The comprehensive tax change promoted by the Maryland Fair Funding Coalition seeks   that they say would ultimately cut taxes for the bottom two-thirds of Maryland households while increasing the tax burden on the top 1 percent by less than a percentage point. The largest revenue source would be through changes to corporate tax code, including requiring worldwide combined reporting and limiting large corporations from using the benefits of granted to LLCs under Maryland law. “The state needs revenue, not to just maintain our commitment to the Blueprint, but to make sure that we’re not pitting education funding against housing, against child care, and against transportation,” said Kali Schumitz, a spokesperson for the Maryland Center on Economic Policy think tank, which is part of the coalition. Maryland’s Democrats have been debating whether to raise taxes on corporations by changing a policy known as combined reporting for at least  , with a landmark commission on the state’s business climate   that lawmakers “do not adopt combined reporting and indicate clearly the intent not to do so.” Democratic legislative leaders say hard conversations are ahead about how to manage Moore’s proposed transportation cuts and the fiscal cliff in education spending, including increasing revenue or cutting other state spending. “The cuts that we see the transportation budget are harsh and they’re tangible and will affect every Marylander,” said House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s). “I think it’s going to be incumbent upon us as a House to look at every means available to us to avoid them … I don’t think it’d be responsible for legislators to take any options off the table. And if groups have good ideas, I think it’s great for the process that they present them and we take them seriously.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/26/maryland-budget-tax-reform/,Washington Post,2023-12-26 06:00:00,
"The Colorado Republican Party on Wednesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to ensure that Donald Trump’s name can appear on the state’s primary ballot after Colorado’s high court said he had engaged in insurrection and was ineligible to hold office again.

The request came a week after   that Trump engaged in insurrection before and during the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and as a result is barred from running for office again under a Civil War-era provision of the Constitution. The Colorado Republican Party asked the justices to reverse the ruling, saying the state court had misinterpreted Section 3 of the 14th Amendment and had interfered with the party’s First Amendment rights of free association. “For the first time in American history, a former President has been disqualified from the ballot, a political party has been denied the opportunity to put forward the presidential candidate of its choice, and the voters have been denied the ability to choose their Chief Executive through the electoral process,” Jay Sekulow and other attorneys for the state Republican Party wrote in their  . Trump is far ahead in the race for the Republican nomination, but his candidacy would be endangered if other states also kept him off the ballot. The former president has called the Colorado ruling a form of election interference, while his opponents have argued that he is responsible for putting himself at risk of being taken out of the running. Voters have challenged Trump’s ability to run elsewhere in the country, but Colorado is the only state that has said he cannot run. The Colorado justices put their Dec. 19 decision on hold until Jan. 4 and said they would keep the hold in place if an appeal were filed. By filing the appeal, the Colorado Republican Party is getting Trump’s name back on the March 5 ballot, at least in the immediate term. The U.S. Supreme Court is not obligated to take the case, but legal scholars have urged the justices to resolve the matter promptly so all states follow the same policies. Without a ruling from the nation’s high court, some states could allow Trump on the ballot while others bar him. The  , three years after the end of the Civil War. The amendment provided citizenship to those born or naturalized in the United States and guaranteed equal protection of the law to all, including those who had been enslaved. Section 3 of the amendment, which was originally intended to prevent former Confederates from returning to power, prohibits people from holding office if they “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” after swearing an oath to support the Constitution. The Colorado Republican Party made three main arguments in saying the Supreme Court should reverse the state ruling. Section 3 applies to those who took oaths to serve in Congress or a state legislature, but not to serve as president, the party contended. In addition, states cannot enforce Section 3 because Congress hasn’t given them that power, the party said. What’s more, the Colorado ruling “violates the Colorado Republican Party’s First Amendment associational right to place the political candidates of its choice on both the primary and general electoral ballots,” the attorneys for the party wrote in their petition. On Thursday, attorneys for the six Colorado voters who brought the lawsuit asked the Supreme Court to expedite the case so it could be decided by Feb. 11, the day before most mail ballots are slated to be sent to Colorado voters. They argued it’s important to know Trump’s eligibility before most states hold their primaries. “This case involves issues of exceptional national importance,” Jason Murray and the other attorneys wrote. Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold (D), who oversees the state’s elections and has said Trump participated in an insurrection, called for swift action from the Supreme Court. “Donald Trump engaged in insurrection and was disqualified under the Constitution from the Colorado Ballot,” Griswold said in a written statement. “The Colorado Supreme Court got it right. This decision is now being appealed. I urge the U.S. Supreme Court to act quickly given the upcoming presidential primary election.” The high courts in Michigan and Minnesota have allowed Trump to appear on the ballot in their states, but Maine’s secretary of state barred him from that state’s primary ballot late Thursday. Oregon’s high court is expected to weigh in on a challenge soon.

Brad Ciolek’s interest in baseball was planted in Detroit, where he watched his first game with his dad, an avid Tigers fan. And as Ciolek grew up in the Chicago suburbs, his love of the game grew, too. He attended every  White Sox game he could. By the time he was a teenager, Ciolek realized he wanted to work in baseball. So as a high-schooler, Ciolek sent out letters to MLB general managers, assistant general managers and scouting directors, looking for advice. “I think my return rate as far as getting a response back was probably less than 10 percent,” Ciolek joked. “But a lot of guys did take the time to at least put something in the mail for me and give me some feedback and guidance which, at that point, I was ecstatic, because I didn’t know anybody.” Roland Hemond, the former MLB executive who served as general manager of the White Sox, was one of the few who did reply. His advice: If you want to work in baseball, start working as soon as possible. So Ciolek reached out to the Kane County Cougars, then an Oakland Athletics’ minor league affiliate located in Geneva, Ill., looking for a job. He was  hired, though the work wasn’t glamorous. He picked up peanuts and fireworks from stores before games. He filled in as the team’s mascot, braving the Midwest summer heat in a costume. “The opportunity to be around the game, watching the players, talking to scouts, that really just kind of reeled me in a little bit,” Ciolek said. “I said, ‘You know what, I don’t know where I’m going to end up in baseball. It may not be in baseball, it may just be in sports in general. But this is something that I could see myself doing for a long time.’ ” Fast forward to present day. Ciolek, 37, did end up in baseball. In October, he    as senior director of amateur scouting for the Washington Nationals, a team that has struggled to draft and develop big league talent in recent years. He — along with new vice president of amateur scouting Danny Haas and national crosschecker Reed Dunn — are tasked with helping stop that trend. Haas,  , and Ciolek previously worked together with the Baltimore Orioles, where Haas spent seven seasons before departing in 2019 and Ciolek climbed through the ranks, eventually rising  to head of draft operations. In Ciolek’s tenure in Baltimore, the Orioles drafted top prospect  ,   and  ,  . Ciolek brings an analytics background to Washington, an area he gradually became more interested in as his career progressed. Haas raved about Ciolek at the winter meetings, calling him “creative.” Ciolek was the type to dig into data and “go down a rabbit hole” before offering up his advice, Haas said. The two bring different skill-sets that they believe complement each other. “We’ve got a good blend,” Haas said. “I’m definitely more of a traditional old-school type, taught on looking at swings and deciding on whether players would hit or pitchers could be a pitcher and so forth. And he’s more of a metrics guy. To this point, we’ve been a pretty good balance. Hope to continue that.” Ciolek’s  first major league job was as a media relations intern for the New York Mets in 2007. A year later, he interned in their player development department, then stayed on there until he left for the Orioles in 2011. The Mets had a one-person analytics department when Ciolek started in player development. Ciolek became intrigued how analytics were used on the advanced scouting side, which at the time was primarily advanced scouting reports with hot and cold zones for hitters or tendency reports on how pitchers attacked batters. Ciolek  earned a master’s degree in computer information services in 2017 from Colorado State while working for Baltimore. And when Orioles General Manager Mike Elias arrived in 2018, his understanding of analytics only grew stronger. Ciolek said the work gets harder as other teams bolster their analytics departments. Advanced technology has improved significantly over the years, making data more accessible and reliable at all levels. And that data can provide insight into players that teams didn’t have 10 to 15 years ago. “The horses are probably going to get there one way or another,” Ciolek said. “More or less, taking guys that aren’t necessarily finished products or guys that are later round picks and more or less helping them and molding them into big league contributors on a day-to-day basis.” Ciolek hopes the Nationals can identify talent as early as possible in the scouting process so they can take time to do their homework on each prospect. Ciolek said “no team has a crystal ball” when it comes to finding MLB-caliber players, but getting feedback from every part of the organization during the draft process will help the Nationals formulate plans to help their prospects adjust and grow in the minors. As Washington continues its rebuild, Haas, Ciolek and the rest of the staff on the amateur scouting side have their work cut out for them. But for Ciolek, this latest opportunity gives him another chance to continue to realize a childhood dream. “I’m extremely grateful for every opportunity I had, every person that helped me along the way,” Ciolek said. “Even if they took five minutes to give me some feedback, it kind of helped me envision a path forward in what I wanted to do and kind of molded me into the person I am today.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/brad-ciolek-nats-mlb-career/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 10:03:00,
"As Russians prepare for their own holiday season, the government’s crackdown on political activists and citizens who have voiced their opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, does not appear to be taking a break. On Friday, a court in Siberia sentenced a former head of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s local headquarters to nine years in a penal colony. And on Thursday, two Russian poets who publicly staged antiwar poetry readings in a central Moscow square were sentenced to seven years and 5½ years in prison, respectively. As Russians prepare for their own holiday season, the government’s crackdown on political activists and citizens who have voiced their opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, does not appear to be taking a break. On Friday, a court in Siberia sentenced a former head of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny’s local headquarters to nine years in a penal colony. And on Thursday, two Russian poets who publicly staged antiwar poetry readings in a central Moscow square were sentenced to seven years and 5½ years in prison, respectively. Alarm bells have also been sounded over the deteriorating health of two other men who are serving long sentences for antiwar statements, with their lawyers saying they are afraid the men could die in prison. The latest convictions and sentences follow the news that Navalny finally   above the Arctic Circle, after his whereabouts remained unknown for almost three weeks, sending panic through his supporters and opposition circles. The latest developments indicate that Russia’s repressive machine shows no signs of slowing down, and form part of a broadening political crackdown, where Russians are handed sentences on increasingly absurd and conflated charges, often under wartime censorship laws such as spreading “fake news” or “discrediting” Russia’s armed forces, as well as “inciting terrorism.” The number of treason cases was 2½ times higher in 2023 than it was the previous year, with at least 37 such cases, according to First Department, a Russian watchdog. OVD-Info, another watchdog group, has documented 776 criminal cases brought against citizens for antiwar protests or statements since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Igor Baryshnikov, a 64-year-old anti-government activist, was sentenced this June to a 7½-year prison term for posting about Bucha and Mariupol on Facebook. His lawyer says he is in severe pain and needs surgery. Former Moscow municipal deputy Alexei Gorinov, 62, who went missing for over two weeks, resurfaced at a prison hospital in Vladimir earlier this week. His lawyers have also sounded the alarm over his health. In 2022 he received seven years for spreading misinformation about the Russian army. The crackdown now appears to be extending to LGBTQ+ groups and anything the government dubs as an expression of LGBTQ+ identity, as President Vladimir Putin has targeted them and antiwar activists as scapegoats. In a Nov. 30 ruling, Russia’s Supreme Court endorsed a Justice Ministry application to   the “international LGBT public movement” as an extremist organization, following other repressive laws.  drew the ire of Russian politicians and Christian Orthodox activists, leading to police investigations and a tearful public apology after the partygoers were accused  of violating laws prohibiting “gay propaganda.” One rapper, who attended the party in nothing but a sock, was arrested for 15 days for hooliganism and “spreading gay propaganda.” The scandal has highlighted how increasingly anything that deviates from Russia’s conservative patriotism will not be tolerated. On Friday, Ksenia Fadeeva, the former head of Navalny’s political headquarters in Tomsk, in Siberia, received a nine-year sentence in a penal colony and was fined 500,000 rubles ($5,500), after she was found guilty of organizing the activities of an extremist group. Russian authorities designated Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation an extremist group in 2021. “Ksenia is wonderful, brave and honest,” wrote Kira Yarmysh, Navalny’s spokesperson, on X, formerly Twitter. “Ksenia did not commit any crime, she is a brave politician who has been fighting against Putin’s corrupt regime,” read a statement from the Anti-Corruption Foundation. Fadeeva, an elected city councilor who won the election despite monumental odds, was arrested in 2021. She was emblematic of Navalny’s — and the opposition’s — potential in Russia’s far-flung regions. Fadeeva joins a growing list of former Navalny staffers who have been handed long prison sentences for their work, including Lilia Chanysheva from the city of Ufa, sentenced to 7½ years and Vadim Ostanin of Barnaul, serving nine years. Meanwhile, in a dramatic verdict, Russian poets Artyom Kamardin and Yegor Shtovba were sentenced to seven years and 5½ years, respectively, on Thursday, after a Moscow court found them guilty of calling for action against the state. Prosecutors accused the poets of holding “anti-mobilization” readings, after they were detained in September 2022 when they publicly criticized Putin’s “partial” mobilization drive through poetry readings in a central Moscow square that has historically served as a spot for dissident readings and speeches. Kamardin was reportedly hospitalized following his arrest and alleged that police beat him and raped him with a dumbbell. “What have I done that’s illegal? Read poetry?” Shtovba said in his closing speech in court. Kamardin, meanwhile, told the judge: “I fear that neither my physical nor mental health will withstand prolonged imprisonment.” “My convictions will not change, as they didn’t under torture, they wouldn’t with a real sentence, and they wouldn’t even under the threat of death,” he said. Kamardin’s wife, Alexandra Popova, was reportedly dragged from the courtroom after she started chanting “shame” in response to the convictions, and was detained alongside other supporters and journalists.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/russia-dissidents-navalny-fadeeva-karmardin/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 10:34:00,

The library on the fifth floor of the   in Southeast Washington is not known as a polling place. But on Thursday, inmates, officials and advocates came together for a rare event: a special election in which the only people running were incarcerated. In the library, ballot boxes were out. Candidates were making their cases. And inmates wearing orange or yellow jail uniforms were scrutinizing pink ballots, marking their selections with flexible plastic pens that, if smuggled out, would not present a security risk. The election, officials said late Thursday, resulted in a female inmate being elected to represent fellow prisoners for the first time. Shameka Hayes, inmate number 380612, was the candidate who triumphed — the only woman among 11 candidates on the ballot in a facility where men are the vast majority. The seat up for grabs was advisory neighborhood commissioner — one of more than   in the District who typically serve a few blocks’ worth of residents. D.C. jail’s ANC commissioner has the same job: Hayes will represent  , which has a constituency of nearly   — but just 100 women. The seat opened up this summer after Leonard Bishop, the previous commissioner who has served decades in prison after being convicted of murder, was  . Like Bishop, Hayes will work out of a dedicated office at the jail and attend virtual meetings with other, non-incarcerated commissioners, officials said. There are no shortage of problems to address. The Correctional Treatment Facility is part of the D.C. jail — a sprawling campus on the banks of the Anacostia River historically associated  , including allegations of  ,  ,  , flawed   and suicide among inmates. Reporters were admitted to the jail to observe the election under strict conditions. No interviews with or photographs of inmates who had not signed a media release were permitted. Media was escorted by corrections officials at all times. And no journalist was permitted to set foot in the   — the 47-year-old part of D.C. jail that has often been the center of litigation and advocate criticism. Ahead of voting, Hayes, who said she is awaiting trial in a drug case, sat for interviews in a yellow uniform. Conditions at D.C. jail should be improved, she said. Inmates need better food, more education and programming opportunities, and better health care. In her housing area, there are four showers for 40 women, according to Hayes, and just two are operational. The Department of Corrections didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Hayes’s statement about jail conditions. There are a lot of popular misconceptions about inmates, Hayes said. Like her, many at D.C. jail are awaiting some kind of decision in a court proceeding. Many are not even convicted criminals, she said. “Most people need to know — we’re all human,” she said. But Hayes, who won with 25 votes of around 100 votes cast, wasn’t just concerned about inmates. Another issue: parking for correctional officers. “When they’re unhappy, we’re unhappy,” Hayes said. “Their stress is redirected at inmates.” Keith F. Edwards was another candidate on the ballot. Like Hayes, he cited a desire to improve conditions at the jail as motivation for running. He also thought that inmates released from D.C. jail are better positioned to help returning citizens and troubled youth than other policymakers. “I’m incarcerated with these people,” he said. “I know what direction we should go in.” Angie Whitehurst, a volunteer with the League of Women Voters, was on hand to observe the election. The League had worked to register inmates to vote, successfully signing up more than a hundred, according to officials. Now, their efforts were coming to fruition. Registering incarcerated voters was in line with the League’s historic mission of expanding suffrage, according to Whitehurst. Too often, individuals are pessimistic about their ability to make change amid government bureaucracy, she said. “Activities like this serve to encourage people,” she said. “They know what they need and want.” In a statement, the Department of Corrections said D.C. jail residents interested in running for ANC have to have lived in the district for 60 days and must submit an interest form, among other requirements. Though a felony conviction can disqualify ANC candidates elsewhere, this requirement does not apply to those running from D.C. jail. Individuals do not face retribution for complaining about conditions, according to the statement. In a separate statement, Department of Corrections Director Thomas Faust congratulated Hayes. “Ms. Hayes is also making history as the first female DCDOC resident to assume this position,” the statement said. “We look forward to collaborating with Commissioner Hayes in her new role and working together to serve and support those in our custody.” Once the candidates are declared, they issue statements about their campaign based on prompts from corrections officials. (The department declined to release these statements to The Washington Post.) Then, voting begins. “The DOC then works to ensure every eligible DOC resident that wishes to vote can — either by visiting a designated voting area within the facility, or in some circumstances, having a ballot brought to them,” the statement said. Kent C. Boese, executive Director of the Office of Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, said in an email that the Department of Corrections “was an excellent partner and went above and beyond to ensure that this election was a success.” The jail is not a place for long-term placement, Boese said. Even when an inmate elected commissioner cannot complete the two-year term, the elections are important. “The mid-term vacancy filling yesterday proved that we have supports in place to ensure that residents at the [Central Detention Facility] are able to participate in the democratic process — including service on their Advisory Neighborhood Commission,” he said. Hayes wasn’t sure how long she would be in office. If she’s found not guilty or makes a plea, she could be released before her ANC term ends. Indeed, the D.C. jail ANC commissioner before Bishop also had to vacate his seat — when he was released. “As long as I’m here, I’m going to fight for as long as I can,” Hayes said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/15/dc-jail-special-election-incarcerated-representative/,Washington Post,2023-12-15 14:12:00,

Hill’s teammate, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, and Pittsburgh Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt have made a case to be included, too. And each new favorite has seemed to take an immediate step back, further muddying the waters. It feels like the NFL’s Most Valuable Player award has had a  . Quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes (Kansas City Chiefs), Jalen Hurts (Philadelphia Eagles), Dak Prescott (Dallas Cowboys), Brock Purdy (San Francisco 49ers) and Lamar Jackson (Baltimore Ravens) have all been at the forefront of the conversation, with running back Christian McCaffrey (49ers) and wide receiver Tyreek Hill (Miami Dolphins) also getting support. Hill’s teammate, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, and Pittsburgh Steelers edge rusher T.J. Watt have made a case to be included, too. And each new favorite has seemed to take an immediate step back, further muddying the waters. The award is voted on by a panel of 50 sportswriters at the end of the regular season, so playoff results are not included. Offensive players, particularly quarterbacks, have long dominated the process. No defensive player has won the award since Lawrence Taylor in 1986; Alan Page in 1971 is the only other defensive player to win it. The only special teams player to be named the league’s MVP was Washington kicker Mark Moseley in 1982. Every winner since Taylor has played either quarterback or running back, with quarterbacks claiming 15 of the last 16 awards. But with so many quality performances to choose from, no clear consensus choice and only two weeks remaining in the regular season, who wins the MVP will likely come down to how each voter defines the word valuable. Specifically, does it mean the most impactful player, the best player on the best team or the player having the best individual season? Ask a dozen people who has been the NFL’s best player this season and you might get a dozen different answers. That’s fair: It is hard to get a baseline for the different positions, since they each execute a different job. One way we can equalize performances is by studying  , a metric used to quantify a player or play’s impact on a game’s outcome. It calculates the difference in a team’s expected points before and after every play, considering factors such as down, distance, field position and time remaining. The eventual MVP has either led the league or finished second in expected points added in 16 of the past 21 seasons. Heading into Week 17, Purdy leads all offensive players in expected points added, as he has for weeks — but the narrative has turned against the second-year quarterback after   against the Baltimore Ravens on Christmas Day. However, the expected points added model doesn’t grade interceptions as harshly as public perception might, and it doesn’t value the end of the season more than the beginning, allowing Purdy to remain at the top of the leader board. In addition, the game charters at Pro Football Focus credited Purdy with just   in that loss to the Ravens, suggesting that two of the four interceptions weren’t directly his fault. One more thing to be considered when looking at Purdy’s performance: On obvious passing downs — situations in which teams pass 70 percent of the time — Purdy has completed 133 of 221 attempts for 1,739 yards, with seven touchdowns and three interceptions. That performance has added 45 more points than expected, the second-highest total during obvious passing downs behind Hurts (52 more points than expected), according to the NFL’s play-by-play data. In other words, even when the defense can be reasonably certain San Francisco is going to pass, Purdy has been difficult to stop. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is second in raw expected points added and Prescott third. Allen ranking so high could be confusing to some since he’s having a down year by traditional metrics such as passer rating, touchdown rate and interception rate. Those stats can be deceiving. Pro Football Focus ranks Allen as the   and ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating, which values the quarterback on all play types on a 0 to 100 scale adjusted for the strength of opposing defenses faced,  . On the defensive side of the ball, Los Angeles Chargers linebacker Khalil Mack has 15 sacks which have prevented 38 expected points, the most among individual defenders this season. Watt leads the league in sacks (17), preventing an estimated 30 points. Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson is second in points prevented via sacks heading into Week 17 (slightly more than 30 points, via 16 sacks). Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland, meanwhile,   earlier this year (five), and his eight total interceptions have prevented an estimated 50 points. That’s a huge number. The difference between Bland and Atlanta Falcons free safety Jessie Bates III, who is second in points prevented by interceptions (28), is the same as the difference between Bates and Houston Texans cornerback Kareem Jackson, who ranks 125th. The Ravens lead the league with a 12-3 record, putting Jackson squarely in the mix; he’s  . The   has completed 66 percent of his passes for 3,357 passing yards, with 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions. However, this isn’t a slam-dunk case. ESPN’s QBR objectively ranks Jackson as just the  and the game charters at Pro Football Focus subjectively rank him No. 12 out of 50 qualified quarterbacks. Coincidently, No. 8 also ranks eighth in passer rating and   (an updated passer rating metric that incorporates sacks). In other words, he’s been the best player on the best team, but he probably hasn’t been the best player at his position. In addition, Baltimore’s success on passing plays is around the league average, adding 2.3 more points per game than we would expect based on the down, distance and field position of each throw (ranking 15th, per data from TruMedia). In fact, you could argue that Baltimore’s defense is more responsible for its record than the offense, having saved 8.9 points per contest (second in the NFL through Week 16). Plus, the Ravens have just one more win than the Dolphins, Eagles, 49ers and Detroit Lions. Should   quarterbacks and, in some cases, skill position players be discounted because of a single win? That’s tough to say, but the quarterbacks for those 11-4 teams have all had varying degrees of success, and some have been superior to Jackson in at least some metrics. For example, Tagovailoa ranks 12th in ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating but is No. 1 per Pro Football Focus. The Ravens host the Dolphins on Sunday, which could alter the MVP conversation once again depending on how Jackson and Tagovailoa perform — and on which team wins. We’ve already discussed the merits of various candidates, and everyone mentioned would fit neatly in this category, but for a non-quarterback to be included in the MVP discussion it helps to be on a historic pace. For example, Hill is on pace for nearly 1,900 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns despite missing a game due to injury. (The NFL   is held by Calvin Johnson, who had 1,964 yards in 2012.) Still, there are still some pitfalls to this approach, especially when a teammate can also be considered for the award. Does Hill’s historic performance detract from Tagovailoa’s MVP claim or vice versa? Would either be as statistically impressive without the other? That’s a question for voters to decide. The same is true for Purdy and McCaffrey. McCaffrey leads the league in rushing yards (1,395) and total yards from scrimmage (1,932), and is tied for the league lead in total touchdowns (21). He’s on pace for 24, which would be the most of any player since LaDainian Tomlinson scored 31 in his MVP-winning season in 2006. Not surprisingly, both Purdy and McCaffrey have publicly made the case for the other to be the league’s MVP. No other top player at any other position will get enough momentum to sustain an MVP campaign. Watt, Mack and Bland are all on the outside of the MVP race looking in, despite having the best seasons in the league at their respective positions.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/28/nfl-mvp-race-lamar-jackson-brock-purdy-tyreek-hill/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 14:22:00,
"RICHMOND — A Richmond circuit court judge ruled Tuesday that the Virginia NAACP cannot have access to a database Gov.

The state NAACP filed suit in October under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, seeking documents to explain Youngkin’s criteria for a decision that disproportionately affects African Americans.

RICHMOND — A Richmond circuit court judge ruled Tuesday that the Virginia NAACP cannot have access to a database Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) uses to decide whether to restore voting rights to individuals convicted of a felony. The state NAACP filed suit in October under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, seeking documents to explain Youngkin’s criteria for a decision that disproportionately affects African Americans. Virginia is the only state in the country that permanently strips civil rights from anyone convicted of a felony and empowers only the governor to restore rights on a case-by-case basis. Youngkin’s three most recent predecessors — governors from   — prioritized expanding efforts to restore voting rights. But the process has slowed dramatically under Youngkin. Where former governors Terry McAuliffe (D) and Ralph Northam (D) worked to make restoration more automatic, together returning more than 300,000 people to voter rolls, Youngkin said earlier this year that he will only consider individuals who apply on their own. As the numbers have dropped to a fraction of earlier amounts (from May to October 2022, Youngkin restored about 800 people), civil rights groups have urged Youngkin to explain what factors he considers in each case. The administration released some documents to the Virginia NAACP under a FOIA request, but the group said the process remained murky, so it sought access to the full rights restoration database maintained by Youngkin’s secretary of the commonwealth. In Tuesday’s hearing in Richmond, lawyers from the office of state Attorney General Jason S. Miyares (R), representing Youngkin, argued that the database was exempt from state open-records laws because it qualifies as “working papers,” which are shielded from disclosure. “It is a confidential process,” state lawyer R. Cooper Vaughan told Judge W. Reilly Marchant. “It should stay in confidence. It is for the governor’s deliberative use.” Former Democratic delegate Jerrauld “Jay” Jones, part of a team of lawyers representing the NAACP, questioned Richard Cullen, counsel to the governor, about how the database is used. Cullen said no more than about eight people in the governor’s office have access to the database, which contains personal information about each individual seeking to have their rights restored. The information is provided with the presumption that it will stay private, Cullen testified, offering the example of someone who had been convicted of a felony 20 years before and would not want it made public now. Jones argued that others in the state have access to at least parts of the database, such as local voter registrars who have to find out whether someone who was not on the voting rolls in a previous election has truly been restored by the governor. “This information does go beyond the office of the governor,” Jones told the judge. “We’re entitled to see the information in the database.” But at the end of an hour-long hearing, Marchant said it was clear that he had to rule in favor of the governor and block the release of the database. “It doesn’t seem to be a close question,” the judge said. The database “is created for the governor and his office for decision-making. It’s clearly a working paper created for his deliberative use.” “We think it was the right decision,” Cullen said afterward. But the Rev. Cozy Bailey, president of the Virginia conference of the NAACP, said his group and allies will not stop trying to shed light on the governor’s process and get it changed. “There’s a shroud of secrecy,” Bailey said. “And when we are confronted with secrecy we are concerned that there is something that is hidden that may be inequitable, and that is why we are fighting so hard.” The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have filed suit in federal court to challenge Virginia’s system of felon disenfranchisement. And Democratic leaders who won majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly in November elections have vowed to seek a state constitutional amendment to automatically restore voting rights for people convicted of felonies.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/13/virginia-naacp-youngkin-felon-rights/,Washington Post,2023-12-13 06:00:00,

As of Tuesday, the company is banned from selling two of its newest and most popular wearables — the Watch Ultra 2 and the Watch Series 9 — in the United States, after   by the United States International Trade Commission went uncontested by the Biden administration.

The White House had until the end of Christmas Day to  , but it instead allowed its 60-day presidential review period to quietly expire. On Tuesday morning, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai confirmed in a statement that, after “careful consultations,” it would not overturn the ITC’s ruling. “We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible,” the company said in a statement provided to The Post.

"BALTIMORE — Tawanda Jones’s big brother looks just as she remembers him in the faded photo she has carried to so many protests. Flashing a broad smile and sporting shoulder-length locs, on this July day he hangs from the microphone stand over bold black saying “STRANGLED DURING RESTRAINT” and “Enough is Enough.” BALTIMORE — Tawanda Jones’s big brother looks just as she remembers him in the faded photo she has carried to so many protests. Flashing a broad smile and sporting shoulder-length locs, on this July day he hangs from the microphone stand over bold black saying “STRANGLED DURING RESTRAINT” and “Enough is Enough.” It was here that Tyrone West died, at the corner of Kitmore and Kelway roads in Baltimore, during an exchange with city police officers who had pulled him over for allegedly backing out too slowly into an intersection. It happened in 2013,   movement formed in response to a Florida jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin. Cellphone footage was not yet ubiquitous. There was no body-camera footage — the technology would   until after the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Mo. And while some of the facts of West’s death matched those of others whose names captured national attention in the years that followed, he never got it — even in a city that erupted not two years later over the  . Jones, a petite mother of four, has been unable to bring herself to visit her brother’s grave, which is placed above her mother’s. But she has refused to let his in-custody death fade from public view, notching several legal and policy wins in an enduring fight for a criminal investigation that only now seems like a possibility. This year’s milestone for West also marks a decade that Jones, a prekindergarten teacher, has crusaded against police brutality and an American justice system that she says lacks accountability. She takes aim at in-custody deaths during weekly pop-up protests across the city, decrying violence anywhere but especially in Baltimore, a place with a long history of police corruption and racial discrimination. By mid-December, Jones has organized 543 events she calls West Wednesdays, in honor of her brother. She moved them online during the pandemic, but otherwise, she can be found outside on Wednesday nights, sweltering in the summer and freezing in the winter as she shouts her message to anyone willing to listen. “She’s front and center at the struggle for justice for survivors of police violence in Baltimore and in Maryland,” said Sonia Kumar, a senior attorney at the ACLU of Maryland. “It’s not just about the victory. It’s also about the struggle and the effort to get justice … And I think to the extent that Baltimore has influenced the national landscape, she’s a huge part of that.” It has cost her. A warrior to some and inspiration to families shattered by similar deaths, Jones has also been dismissed by some elected officials in Baltimore as a nuisance and disrupter. “She’s so courageous to continue to fight all these years,” said LaToya Holley, whose brother, Anton Black, was killed during an encounter with police on Maryland’s Eastern Shore in 2018. “It’s very draining. It’s very time-consuming. It drains your energy and your mind because you’re always putting yourself in that place. It’s hard to move forward when you’re still fighting to try to see someone — anyone — to take you seriously about your loss, your pain, and what kind of individual your family was,” Holley said. Jones has lost time with her family, money from her savings and peace as she endures a spotlight she wants shined only on the final minutes of her brother’s life. She has no plans of stopping. This year, the city’s top prosecutor, Ivan J. Bates, and the state’s top law enforcement official, Anthony G. Brown, have agreed that her brother’s case is worth review. Neither has committed to reopening it. Jones had a sense of foreboding after leaving church the morning after the Zimmerman verdict. Toward the end of the message, Bishop Orlando Wilson implored the congregants of New Antioch Church — including West — to “be careful out there … Seems like Black lives don’t matter.” Four days later, West was dead. At first, the medical examiner’s office tied his death to a bad heart and dehydration — not the lacerations and wounds found across his body and documented in 2013. “I was like ‘oh no, you’re not going to do this to my brother,’” Jones said. Weeks after her brother’s death she planted herself outside the coroner’s office at one of her first West Wednesdays, “urging the world to watch.” The office was then headed by David Fowler, who years later would testify as an expert witness for the defense of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who was on trial in the killing of George Floyd. Today, about a hundred in-custody deaths involving police restraint that were handled by Fowler’s office during his 17-year tenure are under review. Former city prosecutor Gregg L. Bernstein cited the office’s report in declining to charge the officers involved in 2014. So Jones spent $50,000 of her savings to have her brother’s body exhumed for an independent autopsy, which found West died of asphyxiation while being restrained. “I couldn’t wait to go on my own pursuit,” she said in an interview, through tears. “Because in my mind, I’m like, it’s never over. I’m not going to stop until these killer cops are in cell blocks. I don’t care how many years it takes. I don’t care. I’m going to keep going at it.” The same year, she and her family opened another front in their push for accountability, with a wrongful-death lawsuit that laid out their findings. About a week before a scheduled court appearance in 2017, Jones and her family were summoned to a settlement hearing. Jones was sitting across from her attorney with a pen in her hand when someone mentioned a nondisparagement clause. “What does that mean?” she asked. The clause would prohibit her from mentioning the names of the officers who were involved in her brother’s death during West Wednesdays, they said. She dropped the pen to the table and walked away, removing her name from the civil suit to reserve her right to protest without jeopardizing the $1 million settlement for her nieces and nephews. Jones said West, an artist who loved to draw, was a father who never met many of his grandchildren. Months after the settlement, Jones joined Ashley Overbey Underwood, a Baltimore City woman who lost her settlement with Baltimore police in a misconduct case because she violated the gag rule, to change the city law. They met with the ACLU, who took Underwood’s case, and testified at hearings at city hall where they sat with tape over their mouths in a sign of protest. Two years later, the law was changed. Over the last decade, Jones has become a fixture at city hall and at citywide town halls, calling out elected officials and chiefs of police for corruption and misconduct. She has lobbied against the city’s choice for police chief and protested against efforts to shield police records. “Things don’t happen overnight, not as fast as we want them to,” Jones said. Two former prosecutors in Baltimore refused to file charges in West’s death, basing their decision on the official autopsy that found West died of cardiac arrhythmia from cardiac conduction system abnormality complicated by dehydration during police restraint. But earlier this year, Bates, with six months in office, gave Jones more hope than she’d had in 10 years. Bates said in a letter that the case merited a review. “It put into words that something is not right, and that meant the world to me,” Jones said of Bates’s determination. Bates met with Jones several times and she shared additional information “that I believe warrants a new investigation into this incident,” Bates said in a letter to Brown. He asked the attorney general’s office to launch an investigation. He also wrote a letter to State Prosecutor Charlton T. Howard III suggesting that his office, which investigates misconduct of public officials, look into whether there was any perjury or other misconduct involved in the case. Bates said in the letters that he had a “personal conflict” that kept him from pursuing the case. As it turns out, a Bates spokesman later said, a top member of his team is a close relative of one of the officers involved in the case. Police at the time said that when West was told to get out of the car, they saw a bulge in his sock that they suspected was drugs, which would have been a violation of his parole, and a chase and altercation ensued. They said West was combative. But they also acknowledged in court documents that they threw punches and used batons and pepper spray. In his letter to Brown, Bates cited new autopsy results that contradict the findings in the 2013 report and depositions provided by Jones that indicated that there were no drugs found at the scene or on materials tested. Jones’s “sisters,” former strangers who have lost loved ones and often join her for West Wednesdays, said Jones has for years provided evidence to prosecutors and other elected officials who typically dismiss her. “She says stuff and people look at her like she’s got three heads with a big ‘ol eyeball in the middle of her forehead and it’s actually the truth,” said Angela Sutton, whose brother, Timothy Flemings, died after a police interaction. “Everybody knows there are state’s attorneys in bed, literally in bed, with police officers. So the whole system is screwed up.” Whenever Jones learns of an in-custody death in Maryland she tries to reach out to a loved one. Sometimes it’s a direct message on social media that leads to a phone call. It’s how she connected with Holley, Anton Black’s sister, and Nikki Owens, the cousin of William Green, who was shot six times by a police officer while handcuffed in the front of a patrol car. Earlier this month, Jones began her 541st West Wednesday with “sad news” she learned moments before arriving. A jury had acquitted former Prince George’s police officer Michael Owen Jr. in Green’s death. “He got into a car accident, he hit several cars, nothing that warranted a death sentence,” Jones told the three people in front of her, one of them recording a Facebook Live. “I’m beyond disappointed. I’m heartbroken. It’s disgusting.” Jones called to the microphone a White retired teacher and a loyal member of the West Coalition who went to the court in Owen’s case with other members of Jones’s group. “It’s outrageous that this jury made the decision … I think the guilty party here is the legal system in P.G. County just like the legal system in the rest of the country,” said Bill Bleich, who blamed the outcome on a weak prosecution. Jones said police in many cases, particularly in her brother’s, will change the narrative to criminalize the victim and to attempt to justify their actions. “Dead people do not talk, let’s be crystal clear and when these killer cops murder our loved ones then they try to be our loved one’s voice,” she said. She said police said they saw a bulge in her brother’s socks when he sat down on the curb. When she saw her brother earlier in the day he was wearing shorts and ankle socks, she said. “So they can’t even lie straight,” she said. “To make up that absurd lie. To say he said, ‘You’re going to lock me up for these measly drugs.’ I never in the 44 years of my brother’s life at the time he was executed, never heard my brother use the word measly.” Sometimes, she is tired. But the protests can be healing, she said. “It’s therapeutic for me because I actually get to actually uplift my brother’s voice and name in a positive way. And if I’m angry and I want to press on the microphone or whatever or cry or whatever I want to do, I can let it out and I’m not holding that in,” she said. Jones often ends West Wednesdays soliciting prayer. She said her faith is what has sustained her through the pain. Asking for strength as she continues her journey, Jones paused after announcing the news about the acquittal on Dec. 6, and closed her tear-filled eyes. “If you are into prayer, say a prayer. If not, that’s okay,” she said. “We need positivity because all victims don’t die.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/28/baltimore-sister-protest-police-death-west-wednesdays/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 06:00:00,

"Juan Soto spoke with reporters Tuesday as  . He sat in front of a blank wall and a camera wearing street clothes, with little pomp and circumstance, a quick press session that offered comically little insight into the seismic shift that had taken place for player and franchise.

Juan Soto spoke with reporters Tuesday as  . He sat in front of a blank wall and a camera wearing street clothes, with little pomp and circumstance, a quick press session that offered comically little insight into the seismic shift that had taken place for player and franchise. The only thing noteworthy about the setup was the hat on Soto’s head, a classic Yankees cap, the one he will wear for the first — and perhaps last — time this season. “It definitely fits different,” Soto admitted, and indeed, with all due respect to the Washington Nationals and San Diego Padres, few hats in baseball are heavier than that one. Soto officially became a Yankee last week when the Padres, convinced they did not have the financial space to thrive with him in the short term or keep him in the long term,  . Although he is just 25 years old and one of the most prolific left-handed hitters in the sport, the Yankees will be Soto’s third team. And mere minutes into his first appearance as a Yankee, he was fielding questions about whether he would be open to making them his last. “My priorities right now is get to know the team, get to know the guys, really,” Soto said, when the second question of his afternoon centered on his willingness to sign with the Yankees when he hits free agency next winter. “ … about any contract stuff, they know where to call and who to talk to. I’m here just to play baseball and just try to keep concentrate and playing baseball.” In Soto’s case, the man to talk to is Scott Boras, his agent, who was also on that Zoom call — presumably just in case. It was under Boras’s guidance that Soto turned down the  , prompting what Soto admitted later was  . And it is because of Boras’s guidance that signing a long-term extension in the Bronx never seemed likely to follow quickly on the heels of Soto’s arrival there. The accepted reality, for both the Yankees and their new star outfielder, is that the 2024 season likely amounts to something of a trial period. “We just got to get to know the organization, get to know the team. Right now, I’m more than excited to get there and see those guys — see how big is Aaron Judge and [Giancarlo] Stanton,” Soto said with a laugh. “It’s going to be pretty cool. So that’s what I’m looking for right now, just to get comfortable on the team and watch how it’s gonna be.” Soto said Judge, like Gleyber Torres and Anthony Rizzo and Gerrit Cole, reached out to him after the trade. He gushed about the idea of playing alongside Judge, but also seemingly went out of his way to acknowledge the pairing might be temporary. “It’s going to be exciting, man. It’s going to be fun, really fun to see him play hitting and playing outfield,” Soto said. ""[I’ll be] trying to pick his mind while I’m there and try to enjoy the moment while I’m there.” The “while I’m there” was implied in several of Soto’s answers, meaning that whether calculated or subconscious, the lack of certainty long-term is top of mind. Asked about his feelings about joining the Yankees, for example, Soto said “it’s just great” before continuing. “It’s really exciting to see this organization and try to be part of it for the next season,” he said. But Soto, as much as any major trade acquisition the Yankees have made in recent years, seems to have good reason to believe he can thrive there. He has family in New York, uncles on both sides, and many longtime family friends from the Dominican Republic. The Bronx has a large Dominican population, the largest of any city Soto has called home during his career. And  , he seems to love the New York stage. “It’s always good to see the family and friends I have in New York,” said Soto, who said even the batter’s box at Yankee Stadium is one he enjoys stepping into. “ … just a great vibe, a great feeling to be playing in New York in that stadium with the fans, the crowd is just incredible. Even when they weren’t cheering for me, they were booing me and everything, I really enjoyed my time there.” Plus, Yankee Stadium has a notoriously short porch in right field, one no Yankee has really made his own in recent years, as their lineup has been heavy on right-handed power and light on left-handed depth. Soto made himself into one of the game’s more productive hitters by relying on his rare opposite-field power and is at his best when he is trying to hit low line drives up the middle or to left-center. Perhaps the short porch will make him overeager. He says he intends not to think about it much at all. “We all know that there’s a really short porch right there and it’s going to be on your mind, but definitely I’m going to try to stay in the same approach I’ve been doing. That’s what takes me to where I’m at right now, so I think there’s no reason to change it.” Soto said. “I think I’m going to try to do the same thing, and if I get a chance to pull any ball and hit it that way, that’s fine for me. But definitely, like you say, my strength is going to left-center and that’s what I’m going to try to do.” At times during his tenure in San Diego, Soto seemed to be trying too hard to impress, pulling  , where he had less to prove. And though he is now a wise, old 25, a slightly younger version of him was visibly affected by the contract talks two years ago that preceded the Nationals-Padres trade. The pressure, and the temptation to try to do too much to meet it, will be as high in New York as it has ever been for Soto. But he said Tuesday that he does not expect the idea of a long-term deal to test him. After all, he has now seen all that before. “I’ve been doing it for six years now. I think it’s not going to be that hard because I have one of the best agents in the league,” Soto said. “I put everything on him and let him do his magic. My mind-set is just to come here and play baseball and try to win a championship.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/13/juan-soto-yankees-future/,Washington Post,2023-12-13 16:10:00,
"After D.C. housing officials abruptly changed the rules of a cash-strapped program for first-time homeowners this fall, the D.C. Council voted Tuesday to try to restore opportunities for an untold number of lower-income residents who were effectively barred from the program under the new criteria. The council action caps a tumultuous year for the District’s flagship Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP), which ran out of money over the summer and was revived in October under new rules that . After D.C. housing officials abruptly changed the rules of a cash-strapped program for first-time homeowners this fall, the D.C. Council voted Tuesday to try to restore opportunities for an untold number of lower-income residents who were effectively barred from the program under the new criteria. The council action caps a tumultuous year for the District’s flagship Home Purchase Assistance Program (HPAP), which ran out of money over the summer and was revived in October under new rules that . The legislation, which passed on an emergency basis Tuesday during the council’s last legislative meeting of the year, ensures that any HPAP applicant who was found eligible for the program before Oct. 11 will not be subject to the new restrictions. Those restrictions capped HPAP aid at 30 percent of a home’s price and caused some lower-income participants to no longer qualify for loans they had lined up that were based on the previous program criteria. “This [program] is the only way that most people can build wealth and intergenerational wealth, and I don’t want to see that opportunity lost for folks who, using this program, can be homeowners in the District of Columbia,” said council member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large), chairman of the housing committee, who introduced the bill. “These are the folks that we should most be helping, and unfortunately they were the first ones on the chopping block.” In a letter to the council on Tuesday, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) urged the body to vote against White’s HPAP legislation. Describing it as “well-intentioned,” she warned it would “bankrupt” a program already stretched thin. With the 2024 fiscal year not even a quarter of the way over, only $5.9 million of the $26 million in funding   — signaling it is likely to run out of funds for the second consecutive year. “Even with these changes,” Bowser wrote, referring to the new HPAP restrictions, “demand for the program remains at an all time high and, at the current spend rate, HPAP will exhaust its funding far earlier than anticipated. Enacting this emergency legislation will simply exhaust HPAP’s funding even faster.” In a city steeped in wealth inequality, HPAP is intended to boost homeownership for low- to moderate-income residents and also build generational wealth for Black residents, a major goal of Bowser’s. But under the weight of crushing demand, the program could barely withstand significant hurdles that deeply complicated the lives of eligible participants this year. The mess is the making of Bowser’s administration, council members said, showing how big promises can clash against the hard reality of limited funds to leave hopeful residents in the lurch. Problems began after Bowser, to great fanfare, announced in October 2022 that she was more than doubling the amount of aid available to applicants from $80,000 to more than $200,000, with deferred repayment of interest-free loans and help with closing costs. Those changes caused a spike in demand for the program even though the HPAP budget had not increased to handle it. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) had to scramble to reprogram tens of millions in funding to try to meet the climbing demand. Council member Zachary Parker (D-Ward 5) accused the administration of mismanagement of the HPAP program after Bowser rolled out the enhanced aid, giving false hope to residents who were banking on it. “While on paper that was a wonderful and welcome change … the ensuing months demonstrated how ill-prepared the agency was to deliver on that promise,” Parker said during the meeting. The program  , midway through the fiscal year. The announcement whiplashed scores of prospective home buyers who were in the middle of trying to close on homes only to find out the HPAP funds were no longer available. Though they waited for the HPAP funds to reopen in October, with many trying to lock down home deals in the meantime, they were surprised to learn that the DHCD was reopening the program under entirely different criteria. In addition to capping the aid at 30 percent of the home price, HPAP aid could not exceed the first-trust mortgage. The new rules were intended to spread the limited funding across more people, Bowser said. But White said this came at the expense of those with the lower incomes who needed it the most. Spokespeople for the Bowser administration did not provide more comment on the matter, including about whether the administration would abide by the council’s directive given Bowser’s opposition. Multiple lower-income applicants   that under the new criteria, the contracts they had secured for homes became unworkable, causing them to likely lose the opportunities unless the administration made exceptions for them, which didn’t happen. For example, William and Lorie Smith, a couple on a fixed income, said they qualified for the maximum HPAP aid — just over $200,000. They hoped to put that HPAP assistance toward a $420,000 home in Southeast Washington. A loan they secured from a private lender would make up the difference. But when the program reopened under the new restrictions, due to the reduced aid, suddenly the couple instead needed a loan of more than $300,000 to make up the difference — which they did not qualify for. Sellers got burned, too. Real estate agent Jeff Saferite said that his client hoped to sell her home in Southeast to an HPAP recipient and spent thousands of dollars out of pocket to do HPAP-required repairs to pass inspection. After the change in criteria shattered the deal, the seller was saddled with additional fees for a delay in closing on a new home she herself had hoped to buy. The seller lost over $11,000 that she won’t get back, Saferite said, and still doesn’t have a buyer. “It’s just a domino effect on a lot of people in a lot of situations,” Saferite said. In a Nov. 30 statement provided by DHCD spokeswoman Pamela Hillsman, the agency defended the changes, noting that although people were found eligible for HPAP before the changes, they had not yet been approved for funds. “The pace of HPAP purchases has not slowed since the new criteria was put in place,” the statement said, “showing that there is still an overwhelming demand for new home buyers in HPAP’s qualified income ranges to purchase homes in the District — and DHCD is charged with administering HPAP resources as efficiently as possible to help create as many first time home buyers as possible through the program.” White acknowledged that the legislation may give all applicants who were in line for help before Oct. 11 an equal opportunity to obtain HPAP assistance without the impact of the new restrictions but that it won’t solve the problem of the still-limited funds in the program, meaning aid is not guaranteed for anyone. “I wish we could guarantee it,” he said. “That’s not the reality for anybody in the program, but at least folks will have a chance now to purchase homes.” Asked if the council would aim to significantly increase HPAP funding in the next budget cycle, White said he wanted to be cautious about repeating the mistake of making promises for HPAP that he isn’t certain the council can deliver on. The city is confronted with soaring demand not just for HPAP but for numerous social services, ranging from food assistance to emergency rental help, coupled with an enormous funding shortfall for the public transit system, White noted. “I think we also have to be more thoughtful as a city about announcing and rolling out programs that don’t have enough money in them,” he said. “If we increase the amount of money people can get in the program without increasing the pot, it’s going to lead to a lot of heartbreak, and that’s a tough lesson that folks are learning now.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/19/dc-council-hpap-vote-first-time-homebuyers/,Washington Post,2023-12-19 20:02:00,

Washington, which   for veteran journeyman Jacoby Brissett, can gain little in the long term beyond the individual development of non-quarterbacks and a loss that would help it maintain a high draft pick. But my editor says I have to keep giving my fellow football sickos stats to know. So here we go. Washington holds the No. 3 pick over New England even though it has the same record (4-11) and beat New England earlier this year. That’s because the first tiebreaker for NFL draft order is strength of schedule, calculated by average opponent winning percentage. Washington’s strength of schedule is .518, and New England’s is .522. Strength of schedule is a critical number to watch for draft order over the next two weeks, though it’s hard to predict where it’ll end up. The good news for Washington is its last two opponents (San Francisco and Dallas) are tougher than New England’s (Buffalo and the Jets).  for the first time since being traded to San Francisco in November. The former No. 2 pick has been a rotational edge rusher for the 49ers, playing 54 percent of the snaps and generating a very good pressure rate of 13.3 percent. But he hasn’t made many splash plays: 2.5 sacks, one batted pass and one tackle for loss. Young told 49ers reporters this will be just another game for him. But star edge rusher Nick Bosa, who also mentored Young at Ohio State,  . “This week is a huge one for him,” Bosa told reporters. “He’s already pretty hyped up about it and excited, so we’re going to try to play our best game for him.” There are a lot of ways to illustrate the 49ers’ offensive greatness this season. Coach Kyle Shanahan, one of the best play-callers in the league, consistently schemes up explosive plays for quarterback Brock Purdy and his superhero-stuffed supporting cast. But one cool way is to point out that defenses often stuff the tackle box: Running back Christian McCaffrey has faced eight-man boxes on 36 percent of his rushes this season, and the Niners’ offense has faced them on 32 percent of snaps overall. Both of those are highest rates in the NFL for their respective categories. But the thing is, it doesn’t matter. The 49ers have remained, even in those situations, efficient, successful and explosive.

"The owner of the Washington Wizards and Capitals has reached a nonbinding agreement to move the teams from downtown D.C. to a future arena in Northern Virginia as soon as 2028, shaking the regional sports landscape and teeing up sharp debate among local and state lawmakers who could make or break the deal. The owner of the Washington Wizards and Capitals has reached a nonbinding agreement to move the teams from downtown D.C. to a future arena in Northern Virginia as soon as 2028, shaking the regional sports landscape and teeing up sharp debate among local and state lawmakers who could make or break the deal. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) and Ted Leonsis, owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, announced the proposal Wednesday, standing on a dirt lot in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood where they hope a $2 billion, 12-acre mixed-use complex will rise. While no official deal has been signed, Youngkin said he felt confident enough to join Leonsis and others in making the details public. “This is the exact same process we undertook with HQ2,” Youngkin said, referring to Amazon’s East Coast headquarters in nearby Arlington County. “It’s an agreement — a very formal handshake and understanding.” The proposal faces multiple hurdles at the state and local level, and drew sharp reactions Wednesday from across the political spectrum, with District leaders pledging to continue their efforts to retain the NBA and NHL teams and Virginia lawmakers on both sides of the aisle questioning whether officials should be focused on wooing a billionaire sports team owner to further develop a well-resourced corner of the state. Two aides to Youngkin who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share confidential details of the plan said the state would contribute $150 million to $200 million in transportation improvements for the project and issue $1.4 billion in bonds through a newly created sports and entertainment authority. The bonds would be repaid over 40 years, in part with a portion of tax revenue generated from the first phase of the project, arena parking revenue and annual rent paid by Monumental. The governor’s aides said terms of the 40-year lease were still being negotiated. At Wednesday’s event, many of the elected officials present pledged to listen to the prospective arena’s neighbors and to Virginia taxpayers as they weigh next steps. As a small crowd of protesters could be heard chanting outside — and fliers imploring elected officials to “save the neighborhood” went up in surrounding areas — Leonsis echoed that promise. “Hold me accountable. I feel that is not just words,” he said. “My commitment to you is we will do the right things in the right way to all the communities that we serve.” He did not take questions following the event. If Monumental ultimately moves the Capitals and Wizards to Virginia, it would mark a major economic development win for Youngkin and the city of Alexandria and  . The transition could also ease the path for Leonsis to take the company public, a possibility he has openly discussed. Preliminary development plans for Potomac Yard ARLINGTON CO.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) late Tuesday night  including $500 million in public funds, that she said represented the District’s “best and final offer.” And while some District boosters have signaled that losing the Capitals and Wizards would spell disaster for downtown D.C., Leonsis at Wednesday’s event suggested that his loyalties are to the region — not D.C. proper. “That notion of community in the DMV really is what our business is about,” Leonsis said. “That’s the higher calling for sports. That is the higher calling on everything that we do — to build these legacies through winning championships from doing the right things in the right way by our fans, so that people can appreciate the community that they live in. It’s no secret that this great airport here was considered Washington National, and yet it’s in Virginia.” The proposed move comes at a time when the economics of sports franchise ownership are changing. For decades, team valuations have ballooned in large part thanks to media rights deals, but cord-cutting has threatened to limit that growth, which means owners will look for new economic drivers. Youngkin said Monumental’s upfront contribution to the project will be “more than $400 million.” The plan would ultimately allow Monumental to control two local arenas for live entertainment and boost the number of events it could host per year. Unlike the moneymaking entertainment district the Atlanta Braves have opened in suburban Cobb County, Ga., Monumental wouldn’t own most of the surrounding development. Two people briefed on the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss deliberations said they were told rent would be about $30 million a year. Monumental would get to sell naming rights for the arena, but the state could sell naming rights for the broader entertainment district, with those proceeds also going to pay down the bonds. Renderings for that district provided by Monumental show a 20,000 seat arena, practice facilities for the Wizards and Capitals, expanded esports facilities, a “fan plaza” and a performing arts venue in addition to Monumental’s global corporate headquarters and a Monumental Sports Network studio. Two Youngkin aides said the bonds would be paid back with income taxes on players, executives and workers at the site, plus business, sales, ticket and hotel tax revenue generated only from the first phase of the development, which would include the arena, convention center, concert venue, two hotels and an unknown number of apartments. Any portion of those taxes earmarked under state law for transportation, education and the locality would not be used for the bonds, and no new taxes will be imposed as part of the plan, the aides said. Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said that lawmakers began “kicking the tires” on the project “about seven or eight months ago.” Leonsis approached the city first, Alexandria City Council member R. Kirk McPike (D) said in an interview, prompting further discussions that then looped in state officials over the summer. The plan got unanimous approval from a committee of Virginia state lawmakers at a closed-door meeting Monday — a major tipping point in the timeline. Under the deal Bethesda-based developer JBG Smith would sell the Potomac Yard land it owns to a Virginia stadium authority, which would lease the property to Monumental. The stadium authority would issue bonds for the project, allowing the developer to leverage below-market state and municipal interest rates. In addition to being located next to the Potomac Yard Metro station, which is serviced by the Blue and Yellow lines, the facility would be just south of the graduate “innovation campus” that Virginia Tech is set to open next year. Stephanie Landrum, president and CEO of the Alexandria Economic Development Partnership, said the Potomac Yard area would become “a world-class entertainment district” active for 18 hours a day, 365 days a year. The announcement Wednesday “is very much the first step in a lengthy process,” she said. Local officials are eager to transform Potomac Yard, a former rail yard once floated as the potential site for a football stadium, into something more. After Amazon’s decision to move to nearby Arlington County, boosters have pitched the area as part of a tech-centric district they call “National Landing,” in hopes of luring more companies and retailers — and tax revenue — to the area. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and the newspaper’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on the company’s board. More than 7 million square feet of new construction has been greenlighted for development in the neighborhood. JBG Smith, which is also the developer for Virginia Tech and for Amazon’s nearby headquarters, owns or manages much of that land, including a strip-mall shopping center and a large parking area. Last year, it  to build two apartment buildings on the site where Monumental’s complex would be. Officials Wednesday, including JBG Smith CEO Matt Kelly, suggested that the sports facility would catalyze a boom in development in adjacent lots, including a hotel or convention center. Monumental cannot move the Wizards and Capitals to Virginia until 2027 under the terms of its lease. The company in a news release said it plans to relocate the teams in 2028. Leonsis has for several years complained about having a mortgage with unfavorable terms on Capital One Arena, which in 2016 he estimated cost him . He called it “the worst building deal in professional sports” and suggested that he could leave the city when he paid off the mortgage. District leaders on Tuesday expressed concern about what the departure would mean for D.C. as the city is facing severe   and working to revitalize a struggling downtown. In addition to the request for arena renovation financing, city leaders face appeals from the Washington Nationals baseball team for upgrades and competition to host the next Commanders football stadium. If the Wizards and Capitals move, Monumental could transform Capital One to host between 10,000 and 20,000 fans for live entertainment, including concerts. The WNBA’s Mystics could also relocate there from the team’s current home in Congress Heights as early as 2028. A senior JBG Smith executive said he couldn’t disclose the price at which JBG Smith would sell the arena tract of land to the Virginia stadium authority. He said JBG Smith would own and develop the adjacent tracts, which total 55 acres, according to the company. Alexandria officials said the deal would create about 30,000 jobs — though it is unclear how many of those are indirect or temporary, a common criticism that watchdog groups often make of such projections — and result in an economic impact of $12 billion in the coming decades. It is unclear how that was calculated, though lawmakers indicated that millions could go toward affordable housing, rental assistance and other costs. Reaction to the project was mixed even among conservative Republican legislators normally in Youngkin’s camp. State Sen. Mark J. Peake (R-Lynchburg), who early last year opposed a plan to lure the Commanders to Virginia, said he would “urge caution” on any deal that offers tax breaks to an individual business venture in the wealthiest part of the state. “I’m always skeptical of giving tax breaks to billionaires,” he said. “I would much prefer a reduction in the corporate tax rate, which would benefit people across the commonwealth, corporations who have been here for decades, than a single billionaire and maybe a couple of his billionaire friends.” Youngkin has pitched several House and Senate Democrats on the project, according to two people familiar with his efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private conversations. That outreach — notable for a governor who has not had warm relationships with many Democrats and does not regularly lobby legislators of either party — started immediately after Republicans lost control of the House of Delegates and failed to flip the Senate in the Nov. 7 General Assembly elections, the two people said. With Democrats leading both chambers, Youngkin will need them to pass legislation creating a sports authority to oversee financing of the project and approve the additional transportation funds. State Sen. Adam Ebbin (D-Alexandria) struck a cautious note. “I’m going to be evaluating this proposal very closely and I’ll have to weigh the tremendous economic potential for the city and community against any local concerns that would affect the quality of life for local residents,” he said. He added that he’d focus on how the nine-figure sum for transportation would be allocated. State Sen. L. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth), incoming chairwoman of the powerful Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, framed the project as a bargaining chip for regional or Democratic priorities. “While some people want sports stadiums … I want tolls to disappear from Hampton Roads *and* I want recreational sale of marijuana,” she  . “Guess we will have to find compromises this session.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/13/capitals-wizards-move-alexandria-potomac-yard/,Washington Post,2023-12-13 19:22:00,

The decision by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows (D) is sure to be appealed. The Colorado Supreme Court last week   in that state under a part of the U.S. Constitution that prevents insurrectionists from holding office. The Colorado Republican Party has  , which could resolve for all states whether Trump can run again. Both states have temporarily put their decisions on hold so Trump can pursue appeals. In California, the nation’s most populous state, the secretary of state   Trump’s name on Thursday, despite a   from the state’s lieutenant governor to consider excluding him on constitutional grounds. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) had pushed back on the idea, saying Trump should be defeated at the ballot box. In 1868, three years after the end of the Civil War, the United States adopted the   to provide legal protections to those who had formerly been enslaved. Section 3 of the amendment barred those who had sworn an oath to the Constitution from holding office if they engaged in insurrection. That provision was used at the time to   but has rarely been mentioned in recent decades. Trump’s critics cited that section of the Constitution after the  , arguing Trump had incited and participated in an insurrection through his actions before and during the riot. They submitted challenges to his candidacy around the country. So far, only Colorado and Maine have sided with those challenging his ability to run again. Trump, for the time being, is slated to appear on their primary ballots because those decisions are temporarily on hold. “The events of January 6, 2021 were unprecedented and tragic,”  . “They were an attack not only upon the Capitol and government officials, but also an attack on the rule of law. The evidence here demonstrates that they occurred at the behest of, and with the knowledge and support of, the outgoing President. The U.S. Constitution does not tolerate an assault on the foundations of our government, and [Maine law] requires me to act in response.” Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said Trump would quickly appeal the Maine decision. “Democrats in blue states are recklessly and un-Constitutionally suspending the civil rights of the American voters by attempting to summarily remove President Trump’s name from the ballot,” Cheung said in a statement. “Make no mistake, these partisan election interference efforts are a hostile assault on American democracy.” Colorado, Maine and more than a dozen other states hold their primaries on March 5, which is also known as Super Tuesday. Election officials need firm answers on who can appear on ballots weeks before then so they can print ballots and mail them to absentee voters, including ones who are overseas. The challenges to Trump’s candidacy have focused on primaries because Republicans won’t choose their nominee until states hold their nominating contests and the party holds its national convention in July. If Trump’s ability to run has not been resolved by then, attention would shift to the general election. Trump’s opponents have targeted their efforts to states where it is easiest to object to a candidate’s eligibility. In Maine, voters filed their challenges under   that allows them to lodge objections with the secretary of state. Bellows held   on those challenges on Dec. 15 under a provision of that law and determined Thursday that Trump’s name cannot appear on Maine’s primary ballot. Bellows cited the Colorado decision in reaching her conclusion that the Jan. 6 attack “was violent enough, potent enough, and long enough to constitute an insurrection.” And Trump, she said, incited that insurrection by repeatedly and falsely claiming the election was stolen, summoning his supporters to Washington, telling them to “fight like hell” in a speech just as Congress was preparing to certify Joe Biden’s win, and criticizing Vice President   on social media as the attack unfolded. Trump, she wrote, “used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol to prevent certification of the 2020 election and the peaceful transfer of power.” Trump, she added, “was aware of the likelihood for violence and at least initially supported its use given he both encouraged it with incendiary rhetoric and took no timely action to stop it.” Trump has five days to appeal the determination to Maine’s Superior Court. From there, the appeal could go to the state’s Supreme Judicial Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. During the hearing, Bellows did not offer hints on how she was leaning and asked attorneys to weigh in on whether they believed she had the authority to prevent Trump’s name from appearing on the ballot. The Colorado Supreme Court issued its decision four days after Bellows held her hearing, and she allowed Trump and the challengers to file   and say whether it should influence her thinking about whether Trump should appear on the ballot in Maine. Maine’s legislature chose Bellows as secretary of state nearly three years ago. She previously served as a state senator and executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. She was defeated in a 2014 run against Sen. Susan Collins (R). On Wednesday, a day before Bellows issued her ruling, attorneys for Trump asked her to disqualify herself from the case because of past comments she made about Jan. 6. In social media posts in 2021, she called the riot at the U.S. Capitol an insurrection and said she supported Trump’s impeachment for the attack. In Thursday’s decision, Bellows stated that Trump filed his request too late and that she would have remained on the case even if he had filed it earlier because she could handle the case impartially. The high courts in  and   recently allowed Trump’s name to appear on the primary ballot in those states. Meanwhile, challengers have asked the Oregon Supreme Court to review the issue. And a Texas tax consultant running a long-shot presidential campaign has lost a string of challenges to Trump’s candidacy that he has filed in federal courts around the country.

"More than a year after four former Montgomery County Planning Board members  county planning director Gwen Wright, an entirely new board settled a lawsuit she brought over her termination and expressed regret over how she lost her job months before her planned retirement amid a scandal that rocked the body last year. More than a year after four former Montgomery County Planning Board members  county planning director Gwen Wright, an entirely new board settled a lawsuit she brought over her termination and expressed regret over how she lost her job months before her planned retirement amid a scandal that rocked the body last year. The agreement between the new board and Wright included a $100,000 settlement and an award renamed in her honor, the planning agency said in a statement. The county’s top award for design excellence will now be known as the Gwen Marcus Wright Award for Design Excellence. “I’m happy to have this behind me,” Wright said Thursday afternoon. “It was a very fair settlement, all in all.” The planning agency’s new leadership pointed to Wright’s lengthy list of accomplishments in a statement acknowledging the settlement. “Although this Planning Board did not get to work with Ms. Wright directly due to her retirement prior to their arrival, her reputation and long-lasting impact on Montgomery County and Montgomery Planning are well known,” Montgomery County Planning Board Chair Artie Harris   on Thursday. Wright, who worked for the Montgomery County Planning Department for 30 years, had led the effort to build Montgomery County’s historic preservation program, improved forest conservation, launched the county’s first design excellence program, and completed a record number of master plans in Bethesda, Silver Spring, Grosvenor, Rock Spring, Montgomery Village, Westbard, Lyttonsville, White Flint II, and Chevy Chase Lake. “She is recognized as one of the top planning directors in the country and her positive impact on the community will be felt for generations,” Harris said in his statement. In October 2022, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission — a bicounty agency that oversees the parks and planning departments in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties — announced that Wright had been removed from her role as planning director by a vote of the board months before her planned retirement. The agency says Wright is now categorized as “retired,” but Wright maintains that she was fired by the former board. The saga that provoked Wright’s termination began in September 2022, when the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission’s inspector general launched a probe to investigate allegations that then-Montgomery County Planning Board Chair Casey Anderson kept alcohol in his office and shared after-hours drinks with co-workers. Anderson   for having the liquor in a government building, and the county council docked his pay for four weeks, while two other members of the Planning Board were docked one day’s salary. But the planning board’s troubles continued. Other board members were  . Allegations that Anderson created a hostile work environment surfaced, leading to an independent investigation that   to support those claims. Amid that turmoil, Wright spoke to local TV station WJLA to defend Anderson against the unfounded allegations of inappropriate language and behavior in the workplace. One day later, on Oct. 7, the planning board   from her longtime position as planning director without giving a reason for the termination; Anderson recused himself from that vote. Wright   at the end of 2022. Days after terminating Wright, the   their positions at the urging of the county council. Earlier this year, Wright filed a legal complaint against the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and the Montgomery County Planning Board, seeking public records related to her termination. A spokeswoman for the commission said the agency also received a notice of claim alleging wrongful termination, and Wright’s attorney, Timothy Maloney, said the complaint also alleged retaliation for exercising her First Amendment rights. The public records dispute will be withdrawn later this week, Maloney said, and the other claims were resolved out of court by the settlement announced Thursday. Since Wright’s termination and the implosion of the planning board that swiftly followed, the county has been working to restore public confidence in the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. The Montgomery County Planning Board — which has authority over project plans, sketch plans, preliminary plans, site plans, record plans and forest conservation plans — has undergone a complete overhaul, with the county council appointing five new members this year. “I think that the current Board has worked very hard to resolve this,” Wright said. “They definitely pushed to get this wrapped up.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/28/montgomery-county-moco-planning-board-director-settlement-apology/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 17:38:00,

"D.C. Council member Vincent C. Gray said Wednesday that he will not seek reelection next year after prolonged health challenges, bringing a roughly two-decade career in public service to a close. Gray, 81, a Democratic former mayor who lost after one term but revived his political career as a Ward 7 council member, said in a statement that he will serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in January 2025. D.C. Council member Vincent C. Gray said Wednesday that he will not seek reelection next year after prolonged health challenges, bringing a roughly two-decade career in public service to a close. Gray, 81, a Democratic former mayor who lost after one term but revived his political career as a Ward 7 council member, said in a statement that he will serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in January 2025. “My final year in office will be no different than any other; every day I will put my shoulder to the stone and serve the people who sent me here,” Gray said in the announcement. Gray told The Washington Post that he arrived at the decision with his wife in part after reflecting on his health, which declined after a stroke in December 2021 and which has since limited his ability to speak or engage vocally in council debates. Gray declined a request for an in-person interview but agreed to answer questions in writing. “Seeking reelection is making a commitment to serve for four more years and I have had some health challenges,” Gray said in the statement, provided to The Post by his spokesman, Chuck Thies. “I would never want any personal matter to interfere with or limit my ability to serve the people who trust me with this very important job. District residents deserve the best and I cannot assure voters that I will be able to provide that every day down the road.” Questions about whether Gray’s health issues have affected his service and whether he would seek reelection have swirled in D.C. political circles for months, looming large over the simmering Ward 7 campaign. The race is already shaping up to be among the most intriguing local contests on the 2024 primary ballot. Ahead of his decision, six candidates had already filed to replace him. Gray has been a political force in the District over the past two decades. He was first elected to represent Ward 7 on the council in 2004 and later served one term as council chairman before voters elevated him to mayor in the 2010 election. Through his work on the council and as mayor, he carved out a legacy centered on expanding early-childhood education and enhancing health equity — especially in majority-Black or underserved neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River, where access to medical care is limited. Multiple council colleagues reflected on his impact on the city, especially in those spheres, after Gray revealed his decision Wednesday. Council member Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4) called him a “transformational leader” for the city. “His legacy expanding early childhood education, establishing [the Department of General Services], and championing health equity will have an enduring impact in the District,” she  , formerly Twitter. “Mayor, Chair, Councilmember, non-profit leader… the list goes on & on. DC has benefited from Vince’s leadership over the decades,” council member Charles Allen (D-Ward 6)  . “Many lives are better thanks to his work & advocacy. From early childcare to special needs & more, he’s left his mark.” As council chairman in 2008, Gray spearheaded the creation of the District’s universal pre-K program. In his most recent stint as council member, he built on that program with his “Birth-to-Three” legislation that passed in 2018, intended to increase investments in health care for infants and toddlers and boost subsidies for early-childhood learning, though it has yet to be fully funded. And as mayor, Gray’s administration launched D.C. Health Link, which Gray touted in his statement to The Post as one of only four state health insurance exchanges that was up and running at the time that the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2013, significantly expanding D.C. residents’ access to health insurance. “When I took office as mayor, I inherited a city whose finances were in significant decline,” Gray’s statement said. “My administration rebuilt the District’s depleted savings fund and at the same time generated economic development the fruits of which continue to yield benefits.” Gray pointed to his brawls with Congress during federal government shutdowns, which just over a decade ago suspended most city operations as basic as trash pickup. After   during a 2013 shutdown, Gray   on the steps of the U.S. Capitol as TV cameras rolled, demanding that D.C. be freed from the impact of shutdowns. Since then, the city has been largely “insulated” from most of that recurring congressional dysfunction, Gray noted. Gray’s political career, however, took a hit after his 2010 campaign for mayor came under federal investigation for alleged illegal campaign financing. The years-long probe, in which a wealthy contractor admitted to illegally funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to a get-out-the-vote “shadow campaign” in support of Gray, snagged several of Gray’s associates and dogged his tenure as mayor. The probe  , who has long denied wrongdoing and any knowledge of the scheme. The damage helped fuel his defeat to then-Ward 4 Council member Muriel E. Bowser (D) in the 2014 primary election, with indictments against his associates announced just weeks before the election. But it did not prevent Gray from mounting a successful political comeback just two years later. His former rival said the District “is a better city because of the career of Mayor Vincent Gray.” “At every stage of our work together,” Bowser said in a statement to The Post, “Vince has always been a statesman and a champion for DC. We are especially grateful for his work as the architect of our incredible, free PreK program, a champion of Ward 7 and his constant service to our most vulnerable residents.” After returning to the council following a successful 2016 campaign, Gray served as chairman of the council’s health committee and played a key role in a  Progress on those issues, including the development of a health network serving the city’s “East End” — Gray’s preferred term for neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River — are in part what allowed him to decide to step aside, his statement said. “When I returned to the Council in 2017, I did so primarily because the work I’d begun on healthcare as mayor had stalled and funding was insufficient,” his statement said. “For too long, residents living on the East End have had inadequate medical, wellness, urgent care and other healthcare options. Today, we are just a year away from opening a new hospital and many other improvements to healthcare are already in place.” In more recent years, Gray’s council contributions have been frequently overshadowed by concerns about his health. In August 2022, as he was still recovering from his stroke, Gray tore his Achilles’ tendon. The lawmaker’s recovery was further hampered when he   in October 2022. As he has recovered, Gray has had periods of absence from the council and generally has been less visible. A physician advised him not to work more than eight hours a day. At most legislative meetings, Gray is only heard offering a yes or no during votes, his voice largely absent from debates surrounding public safety, social services or other critical issues. Asked how this has affected his ability to advocate for his constituents, Gray rejected the premise of the question. “It has not,” the statement said. He said he has physical therapy sessions multiple times a week and feels strong. “That isn’t to say that I do not have challenges, but who among us doesn’t?” he said. Asked to elaborate on how the challenges have impacted his service, Thies said in a phone call that Gray has “effectively communicated his thoughts and concerns in writing, through staff and in private conversations.” Acknowledging that Gray is not as present at community events or in public discourse as he once was, Thies added that the office hired a third constituent services employee to staff more events. Gray’s office in January said his limitations are physical and only temporary, and noted that he was working with a speech therapist to recover from the stroke and that it was not reflective of his cognitive abilities. But private questions about his health burst into public view in January, after D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) reduced Gray’s council oversight responsibilities by removing him from the health committee and assigning him to a new committee focused on hospitals and health equity. Gray was infuriated by the decision and publicly accused Mendelson of discrimination based on his health. In March, Gray formalized the grievance,   with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the D.C. Office of Human Rights. Gray said that this complaint has yet to reach a resolution and that “confidentiality issues” prevented him from going into greater detail. “I’ve said all I have to offer about my feelings regarding Chairman Mendelson’s decision,” Gray said, adding that the disagreement between him and Mendelson was “not relevant at present.” Gray’s announcement may draw more candidates to the already crowded field, raising the stakes and interest in a race in which candidates have pointed to public safety, the ward’s economy and constituent services as key issues. So far, the six candidates who filed paperwork to run for the Ward 7 seat are: D.C. State Board of Education President Eboni-Rose Thompson; Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner Ebony Payne; Ward 7 Democrats Chair Wendell Felder; longtime community advocate Veda Rasheed; ANC Commissioner Kelvin Earl Brown; and former ANC commissioner and teacher Ebbon Allen. Asked whether he would make an endorsement, Gray said in his statement to The Post that he may “reach out to a candidate whose work ethic, policies and campaign catch my eye,” but that would not be likely to happen anytime soon. He added that he had not yet worked out what he plans to do after his government career comes to an end and that for now he is “one hundred percent focused” on the remainder of his term in Ward 7. He identified the ongoing redrawing of school boundaries, various economic development projects and concerns about public safety as top of mind heading into 2024. “I’ll start thinking about what’s next on January 2nd, 2025,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/20/dc-vincent-gray-council-no-reelection/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 17:47:00,

The spectacle began long before it actually began, as it always seems to do with Shohei Ohtani, the man who ended years of speculation about his future when he   he was signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers. On Thursday, nearly 90 minutes before it was time for his formal introduction as a Dodger, a line of reporters stretched out from the gates to Dodger Stadium. When Ohtani took the stage alongside Dodgers owners and executives, he saw so many faces he thought the team’s media relations staff had changed the rules. “I was told it was only media today, so I wasn’t expecting this many people,” Ohtani said through his interpreter. “It actually is only media,” said Joe Davis, the Dodgers broadcaster and emcee for the day. Such is the phenomenon Ohtani has created, one that even the best player in the world — whose every move is watched on multiple continents, who has a crowd of reporters assigned just to him, whose dog’s name the globe clamored to know for weeks — has not yet seen. The Dodgers are one of sports’ premier franchises, and it is not cruel to their neighbors, the Anaheim-based Angels, to say that the attention they command in one of the country’s biggest cities is beyond what Ohtani experienced in his previous six years. That attention — and the money that comes with it — is why the Dodgers were willing to commit $700 million to a man who will not have full use of his pitching powers for the first season of his 10-year deal. The sports apparel company Fanatics announced Wednesday that Ohtani’s No. 17 Dodgers jersey sold more than any other jersey in the first 48 hours of its release, more than those of global soccer megastars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Ohtani, as always, is something else entirely. “One of our goals is to have baseball fans in Japan convert to Dodger blue,” Dodgers President Andrew Friedman said. “And to have Shohei, along with the rest of his teammates, help grow the game and passion for Dodger baseball all across Japan.” While he admitted he was surprised by the size of the media horde Thursday, Ohtani did not look intimidated. Sure, he looked a little awkward in his navy blue suit than he does in a baseball jersey, though few people have ever looked quite as at home in a baseball jersey as he does. He turned and smiled for pictures, uncertain at times whether to leave the Dodgers hat on or take it off. Then he removed it and stepped to the microphone for his first public comments since August. As ever, this time clad in blue, interpreter and friend Ippei Mizuhara was by his side. “I can’t wait to join the Dodgers. They share the same passion as me. They have a vision and history all about winning,” Ohtani said through Mizuhara. “They share the same values as me.” To the extent that Ohtani made anything clear during the years, months and weeks leading up to his free agency, it was that winning was a priority —   (though he got plenty of that anyway), more than anything. In his opening remarks, Friedman acknowledged that one reason Ohtani is such a fit at Dodger Stadium is because the Dodgers win so often. “I’m not sure how long I’m going to be able to play the game. I do prioritize winning. That is at the top of my list, and that will probably never change,” he said through Mizuhara. Almost as if they still felt compelled to prove their intentions to Ohtani, shortly after their news conference, reports surfaced that the Dodgers had completed a trade with the Tampa Bay Rays for right-handed starter Tyler Glasnow and outfielder Manuel Margot. The deal is contingent on Los Angeles signing Glasnow, coming off a 10-7 season that included 162 strikeouts in 120 innings, to a contract extension. The Dodgers always seemed like the most natural landing spot for Ohtani, though it wasn’t until Thursday evening that he spoke about those priorities himself. He didn’t exactly open up, explaining that he was grateful to every team for pursuing him, making sure to say the decision was difficult, declaring that there were many reasons he chose the Dodgers. He said he decided last Friday night where he would sign, hours before he announced the decision  . “One thing that really stands out in my head was when I had a meeting with the Dodgers, their ownership group, they said when they looked back at the last 10 years, even though they have made the playoffs every year, one World Series ring — they consider that a failure,” Ohtani said. “When I heard that, I knew they were all about winning. And that’s exactly how I feel.” He explained that winning, as his representatives made sure to mention to reporters across the country all week, is the reason Ohtani decided to defer $680 million of the $700 million he will ultimately earn on this deal by 2043. If he could clear room for better players, he explained, then he would do it. None of that was new information. Ohtani, relentlessly careful with his words, does not ever offer much of that. But because he is Ohtani and because nothing about him is like anything that has come before, the tidbit he did toss to the eager masses was downright unforgettable: Asked, after weeks of speculation, for the name of the dog that sat on his lap when he was announced as the American League MVP — the dog whose name people around the industry speculated was being kept private because it might hint at Ohtani’s free agent destination — Ohtani explained that his dog had a Japanese name that he wasn’t sure Americans would be able to pronounce. So he shortened it, gave the dog a nickname the crowds of American reporters could handle — or perhaps, if you allow a little conspiracy theorizing, one that showed how capable he is of handling them. The dog’s name, Mizuhara revealed as Ohtani grinned beside him, is Decoy. A previous version of this article said that Shohei Ohtani is deferring $698 million of the $700 million he will ultimately earn on his contract. He is deferring $680 million. The article has been corrected.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/14/shohei-ohtani-dodgers-official/,Washington Post,2023-12-14 21:49:00,
"KYIV — Russia fired more than 150 missiles and drones at Ukraine on Friday in one of the largest bombardments of the war, officials said, hitting schools, parks, homes, a hospital and other civilian infrastructure, and rupturing the relative calm of an otherwise quiet winter on the conflict’s static front lines. KYIV — Russia fired more than 150 missiles and drones at Ukraine on Friday in one of the largest bombardments of the war, officials said, hitting schools, parks, homes, a hospital and other civilian infrastructure, and rupturing the relative calm of an otherwise quiet winter on the conflict’s static front lines. The scale of the attack confirmed what many in Ukraine have feared for months — that Russia was conserving its missile stocks throughout the fall for massive strikes in the winter. At least 30 people were killed and more than 160 injured in the hours-long assault, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs. In a statement late Friday, President Volodymyr Zelensky   that rescue operations were still underway in several cities. “It is important that the world reacts to this manifestation of terror,” he said. Officials in Kyiv had warned that stalled U.S. security assistance, which includes ammunition for U.S.-made air-defense systems, could embolden the Russians and place Ukrainian cities in peril. Britain’s defense minister, Grant Shapps, said on Friday that his country was sending hundreds of air-defense missiles to Ukraine to ensure it “has what it needs to defend itself from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s barbaric bombardment.” “Putin is testing Ukraine’s defense and the West’s resolve, hoping he can clutch victory from the jaws of defeat. But he is wrong,” Shapps  .  also weighed in, calling the barrage a “brutal attack” and a “stark reminder to the world that, after nearly two years of this devastating war, Putin’s objective remains unchanged.” “He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people,” Biden said in a statement, urging Congress to “step up and act” to approve supplemental funding legislation that would unlock more than $61 billion of security aid for Kyiv, about half of which would replenish Pentagon stocks. The Russians used a mix of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones, Zelensky said. Unlike a year ago, Ukraine’s improved, Western-provided air-defense systems, which now include the Patriot system, contained the damage, shooting down most of the missiles, the president added. Last year, millions of Ukrainians experienced outages when Russia repeatedly pounded the power grid. Still, Friday’s attack damaged energy infrastructure in eastern Ukraine, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  . “The vast aerial assault … forced millions to seek refuge in shelters during a winter night and left a path of destruction and death in most of Ukraine’s regions,” OCHA said. One of the Russian missiles appears likely to have entered the airspace of NATO-member Poland, said Gen. Maciej Klisz, operational commander of Polish armed forces, Reuters reported. Klisz said the object most likely left Polish airspace after spending less than three minutes over the country’s territory and went back over Ukraine. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said he spoke with Polish President Andrzej Duda about the incident, and Poland’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said it summoned Russia’s chargé d’affaires to explain the violation of the country’s airspace. Also Friday, NATO said in a statement that its air forces “across Europe” intercepted Russian military aircraft over 300 times in 2023, with most intercepts occurring over the Baltic Sea. “Russia’s war against Ukraine has created the most dangerous security situation in Europe in decades,” said acting NATO spokesperson Dylan White. About 18 bombers launched missiles, Ukraine’s Air Force said. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, said 87 missiles and 27 strike drones were shot down out of 158 total. The attacks — intended to exhaust Ukraine’s beefed-up air defense, according to officials — hit sites across the country, from Lviv in western Ukraine to Odessa in the south to the capital of Kyiv to Kharkiv and Dnipro in the east. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat   there had never been so many targets at one time. “This time we saw a large amount of rockets,” Ihnat said. “The screen was practically red — the monitors. They were spreading out over the whole of Ukraine. They flew with detours. Some rockets were flying in circles and would then fly on to their target.” Affected buildings included a shopping mall in central Dnipro as well as a nearby maternity ward, which had its windows blasted out and blackened. The Ministry of Health confirmed that patients and staff at the maternity ward had taken shelter, and none were injured. “We understood at once what was happening,” said Natalia Karlova, 65, who lives near the maternity ward. “Everything fell down in our apartment. When we heard the first explosion, we hid in the corridor. If we would’ve been in the room, we would be injured for sure.” By Friday afternoon, her street was loud with the banging of hammers, plywood going up over shattered windows. The smell of smoke hung in the air. Some neighbors leaned out the open frames, smoking or throwing trash bags of rubble to the ground, where orange-vested workers were clearing debris. “What can we do?” Karlova said. Around the corner, employees at a clothing store near the shopping mall were stuffing merchandise into bags for storage. In one bag, the feet of several mannequins poked in the air. On Facebook, Sergii A. Ryzhenko — chief physician at Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro —   injured in the shelling was a 25-year-old who’d gone to the shopping center for bread and cigarettes. He was immediately taken into surgery, he said, and they were “praying … that he will survive.” “Terrible war kills ordinary Ukrainians,” Ryzhenko wrote. A factory in central Kyiv was also targeted, and Mayor Vitali Klitschko said Friday morning that people were believed to still be trapped under the rubble. Thirteen apartment buildings and three schools in Lviv were damaged, local authorities said. In the Lviv region, a critical infrastructure facility was hit, the president’s office said, declining to say which one. Four regions experienced power outages as a result of the strikes. “The people are shocked, such a misfortune during such a festive season,” said Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi, adding that some children would not be able to return to school after the holidays. Ihnat, the air force spokesman, said that it was unclear what exactly the Russians were targeting, as some missiles were intercepted by Ukrainian air defense, and damage was caused by falling fragments. “When certain objects get hit, you can conclude that they were trying to aim for it,” Ihnat said. “But there are also things like debris.” “If a flying rocket is hit, this is a large mass of metal, burning rocket fuel and so forth,” he said. “And the explosives can also still be undetonated. So when the debris of this rocket falls down, it can still have serious consequences on the ground. The work of air defense, even when it’s successful, can still have serious consequences.” Russia’s Ministry of Defense announced Friday that it had carried out a “massive strike with high precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles” against Ukraine’s military infrastructure, including airfields, ammunition and fuel storage sites. It stated that all targeted facilities were destroyed. The statement could not be independently verified. Volker Türk, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said he was shocked at the attacks on Ukraine. “International humanitarian law explicitly prohibits attacks deliberately targeting civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate attacks, under any circumstances,” he said in a statement. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a post on X that he wished “those sounds of explosions in Ukraine could be heard all around the world. In all major capitals, headquarters, and parliaments, which are currently debating further support for Ukraine.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/ukraine-russia-missile-barrage-power/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 13:59:00,
"Washington Commanders quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who was   after performing well in relief of Sam Howell the previous two games, is now questionable to play against the San Francisco 49ers because of a hamstring injury. Coach Ron Rivera said that Brissett complained of tightness and soreness after the team’s evening meetings Thursday. His hamstring was still tight Friday morning, and he was added to the injury report. Washington Commanders quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who was   after performing well in relief of Sam Howell the previous two games, is now questionable to play against the San Francisco 49ers because of a hamstring injury. Coach Ron Rivera said that Brissett complained of tightness and soreness after the team’s evening meetings Thursday. His hamstring was still tight Friday morning, and he was added to the injury report. “We wanted to be careful and see how he’s doing,” Rivera said. “We’re going to monitor him the next 48 hours.” Rivera said that Howell will start Sunday if Brissett is unable to play. “It was kind of surprising late last night finding out,” Rivera said. “... We’ll see how [Brissett] is tomorrow and keep going from there. … He took some reps today and looked pretty good still moving around. But if it’s tightness, the last thing you want is for it to happen during the game. So we got to be smart about this.” The injury has the potential to derail Rivera’s plan to sit Howell after several weeks of poor play. Brissett came off the bench in place of Howell in each of the past two games and rallied the offense both times, leading the team to a total of five touchdown drives. Asked about Howell possibly having to change course after being benched, Rivera said he wasn’t concerned. “Sam has played enough football, just being in those meetings, absorbing the game plan,” Rivera said. “He looked fine out there taking the reps he did.” Quarterback is not the only problem for Sunday, though. Washington’s secondary and offensive line are depleted because of injuries, too. Cornerbacks Kendall Fuller (knee) and Benjamin St-Juste (concussion), safety Percy Butler (wrist), center Tyler Larsen (knee) and left tackle Charles Leno Jr. (calf) were all ruled out. Rivera said rookie Quan Martin will play both safety and nickel to help fill in the gaps alongside fellow safeties Kam Curl and Terrell Burgess. At cornerback, the team will turn to Emmanuel Forbes Jr. and Tariq Castro-Fields. On the offensive line, Cornelius Lucas probably will start at left tackle and Nick Gates at center.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/jacoby-brissett-hamstring-injury-questionable/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 14:06:00,
"Plans for a Northern Virginia sports arena that could move the Washington Capitals and Wizards out of downtown D.C. have drawn sharp questions from residents and elected officials from how it might affect the District’s struggling downtown to how much taxpayers might have to pay. But chief among them has been a pragmatic one: How could it change commutes to, from and near the new arena? Plans for a Northern Virginia sports arena that could move the Washington Capitals and Wizards out of downtown D.C. have drawn sharp questions from residents and elected officials from how it might affect the District’s struggling downtown to how much taxpayers might have to pay. But chief among them has been a pragmatic one: How could it change commutes to, from and near the new arena? The $2 billion project, which was formally announced by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) and Monumental Sports & Entertainment owner Ted Leonsis on Wednesday, would relocate both pro sports teams to a $2 billion, 12-acre mixed-use complex just steps away from a new Metro station in Alexandria’s Potomac Yard neighborhood. Officials have hailed the project, which would be built by a public-private partnership and borrow money from Wall Street to do so, as one that could supercharge development in an underutilized corner of the D.C. suburbs. But in doing so, it would make the Wizards the only NBA team to play outside their home city and the Capitals one of the only professional men’s hockey teams to do so. That has raised worries about how sports fans across the region could get to games, particularly given that the Metro system is facing significant financial trouble. “The traffic and the transportation is probably the biggest unknown here and we have a lot of work to do on that with the community,” said Alexandria Mayor Justin M. Wilson (D), speaking to as many as 450 people at a neighborhood meeting over Zoom on Wednesday night. “That is an absolutely critical part and it is a part that could require a lot of work.” The arena proposal is the subject of a nonbinding agreement and must secure enough votes to make it through both the Alexandria City Council and the Virginia General Assembly. A failure to secure enough votes in either body — or a last-minute decision by Monumental to keep the teams in D.C. — would prevent the plan from being realized. If the teams move to Virginia, many fans across the region who now can get to games in D.C. on every Metro line would need to travel longer to a station in Alexandria that is serviced only by the Blue and Yellow lines. And that’s if those lines are running at all. Metro officials this week outlined severe fiscal challenges, saying if area jurisdictions don’t inject hundreds of millions more dollars, the transit agency could face radical cuts, including ending all Metrorail service daily at 10 p.m. The transit agency blamed lower pandemic-era ridership, the end of federal pandemic subsidies, and inflation, including higher labor costs. Commuters who pass through the Potomac Yard area have worried that its two major thoroughfares — Route 1 and the George Washington Memorial Parkway — could become even more congested on game days. And residents in nearby, more suburban neighborhoods like Del Ray have worried about their neighborhoods effectively turning into an overflow parking lot. At a meeting of the Del Ray Citizens Association, which might draw 30 or 40 people on a good night, hundreds of neighbors submitted a volley of questions to Wilson regarding their concerns — many concerned about whether the roads can take more traffic. “If you talk about even increased development of 20,000 more people coming in, in a venue that’s 365 days a year, it’s very concerning,” Adrien Lopez said after attending Wednesday’s meeting. “Potomac Avenue was not built for that.” Lopez, who lives on the southern end of Potomac Yard, said she has engaged in conversations to organize a formal residents’ group to oppose the arena.

The sports and entertainment complex would have an underground parking garage that some officials have said would have about 2,500 spots. Wilson pledged at Wednesday’s meeting to explore a zoned parking initiative that would limit street parking in neighborhoods like Del Ray to area residents only. Such a program exists for neighborhoods near Alexandria’s other Metro stations, he said. Even before the project, there have been improvements proposed for Route 1. A state transportation study is underway that has recommended turning the road, which is mostly elevated as it runs from Alexandria to D.C. — into an “urban boulevard” with more stoplights that is at the same level as the rest of the street. The state and Alexandria would contribute a combined $150 million to $200 million in transportation improvements to support the arena, though the exact amount is being negotiated by officials and could be affected by which projects are selected. Wilson and others have said that one likely target would be bringing additional service and expanding capacity at the Potomac Yard Metro station, including a ramp that would connect it to the arena itself. Others have floated connecting the site to Amtrak or Virginia Railway Express, which both run on tracks adjacent to the complex and will benefit from a $729 million federal boost   earlier this month. The plan would have had a “more robust” transportation component had the various parties involved been able to discuss options with neighboring Amazon, but they could not do so until the Monumental deal was publicly announced, according to two Youngkin aides who spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity to share confidential details of the project. Improvements proposed for the Monumental project could dovetail with the $295 million pledged as part of efforts to bring Amazon’s new headquarters to Arlington County. The Metro station was one of the Amazon transportation improvements, but more of that money remains to be spent. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and The Post’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on Amazon’s board.) Metro General Manager Randy Clarke said he was not involved in the process over a plan to woo Monumental but echoed Wilson’s focus on expanding capacity. “If it all moves forward, we’re going to have to obviously do tight collaboration and coordination with the larger development,” Clarke said. “If it’s a $2 billion investment, I would like to think there will be some type of interaction with us to do that.” The Monumental project also includes $110 million in “on-site infrastructure” including road, signal and intersection improvements funded through bonds that would be issued by a Virginia stadium authority. The authority would build the stadium, borrowing money from Wall Street that would then be paid back in part with taxes generated through the project. Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) said he hopes the Monumental project will nudge Youngkin and other Republicans to support finding solutions to the ongoing Metro funding crisis, achieving a “fair, permanent, long-term funding solution for this incredibly important public asset. “The only reason this project is going where it is, is because it’s sitting next to a Metro station, and I hope that reality opens the governor’s mind to the supercharging that Metro provides to the Northern Virginia economy,” he said. “If you look around Northern Virginia, all the construction cranes are around Metro stations. And screwing around with Metro funding is a great way to poison the goose that lays the golden egg for the entire commonwealth.” Surovell said fellow Democratic legislators have been discussing with the administration how to solve Metro’s funding shortfall this year and its ongoing structural deficits. He declined to comment on the substance of those private discussions, but he expressed hope that Youngkin would look more favorably toward Metro with Monumental in the mix. Asked about whether the Monumental project might make the governor more inclined to support Metro funding, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter did not answer directly but said in an email, “Up to $200 million of offsite transportation infrastructure costs are being addressed by the Commonwealth and City.” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), an Alexandria resident and former Virginia lieutenant governor, said his larger questions were focused on transportation in the area. But he also pointed up to the road, to the second headquarters Amazon has constructed in Arlington. “When Amazon was coming, there were all these concerns about what it’s going to do to transportation, what it’s going to do to housing. It’s no harder to drive down Route 1 than it was before.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/14/capitals-wizards-arena-virginia-alexandria-transportation-metro/,Washington Post,2023-12-14 21:16:00,
"It makes sense that parents want to share their children with the world. Their easy smiles, moments of joy and milestones feel like something innocent to celebrate. Most people also know better than to post young children, tweens or teens excessively online. By now, we’re familiar with the risks of sharing photos and videos of minors to websites or social media apps, where they can be used for bullying or misused by strangers.

Their easy smiles, moments of joy and milestones feel like something innocent to celebrate. Most people also know better than to post young children, tweens or teens excessively online. By now, we’re familiar with the risks of sharing photos and videos of minors to websites or social media apps, where they can be used for bullying or misused by strangers. An evolving threat is artificial intelligence tools, which are improving at a dizzying pace. They can be fed real images and photos to make “deep fakes.” It’s already happening. New Jersey   allegedly used AI tools to make sexualized images of their classmates using “original photos” last summer. A high school student in Issaquah, Wash., allegedly  of classmates to make sexualized images, which were then shared around. And in Spain,   between the ages of 11 and 17 say photos of their children were altered using AI tools to create sexual images. AI tools “need as little as one picture now,” says Wael Abd-Almageed, distinguished principal scientist and research director at the University of Southern California’s Information Sciences Institute. “You can train AI to pick up the facial features of somebody, so if the AI can pick up the facial features for a child, you can replace them in a video.” There’s not a magic eraser button to wipe every image or video of someone from the internet. If you already know what you want taken down, that’s easier. But if you’re dealing with a child whose likeness has been shared widely, tracking down everything will be time-consuming or even impossible. “What goes on the internet stays on the internet. It can never go away,” Abd-Almageed said. Images and videos are shared and reshared, backed up and archived by companies, or can be saved and shared in encrypted chats or on the dark web, he said. Even removing a photo of a minor from Google search results doesn’t really take it off the internet. It will still exist on the site that was hosting it. Whether it’s cleaning up the past or controlling the future, keeping all of a child’s data off the internet is also a huge commitment and may be unrealistic for most families. “It might not be a level of vigilance most of us can live with at this point,” said Devorah Heitner, author of “Growing Up in Public: Coming of Age in a Digital World.” Instead, she suggests looking ahead and giving your child a say over if and where their image appears online. Most large tech companies have a system to request images be taken down. We’ve rounded up the basics for Google, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. There are always exceptions, and not every photo can be removed. As your children get older, you might also run into issues with them wanting to share themselves more than you are comfortable with — most services will let minors create their own accounts as long as they are 13 or older. A minor, their guardian or someone authorized to act on their behalf like a lawyer can request content — an image, video or text — be removed from Google Search results  . There are some limitations. It only removes content from Google’s results, but they will still exist on the original site. Google won’t take down content if it’s on your own social media page and may decline requests if the images are in the public interest — say, a child is a public figure or the photo is from a newsworthy event. The process typically takes a few days. If the image is on Google Photos, you can  , and  . If it’s a photo that has been removed but still shows up in search results,  .  If there’s a video of a child on YouTube, the minor or their representative can fill out a request to  . YouTube is adding AI-generated materials in its policies so that you can more easily request their removal as well. These social media sites will only let a parent request the removal of content for minors under 13 years old. If a child is between 13 and 17, they must submit a request themselves. Links to the forms for  , and the forms for  .  If you want to request TikTok remove a video of a minor, the person depicted or their guardian must fill out  . Select “report a privacy violation” from the drop-down menu. Posting a minor without their permission does not automatically violate the company’s community guidelines — but if flagged, the company says it should remove them. Start with Google searches of their names, comb through social media accounts for yourself, family members and any schools or clubs they’ve belonged to. If you’re looking for copies of a specific image, try doing a reverse-image search. Go to   and click the camera icon to search by image. A number of controversial face-detection companies like Clearview AI and PimEyes can take one image of a person and find matches across the internet. Unfortunately, they are not designed to be useful for people trying to control their own privacy. PimEyes is available to the public but recently said it would no longer include faces its AI systems flagged as minors. Clearview AI says its database is meant for entities like law enforcement, not individuals. There is little to no legislation preventing companies from scraping the web for images. However, there are state privacy laws you can use to get a list of images from these sites in California, Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia. First, submit a request to access your or your child’s information — here’s the   link and here is  . You should get a file back that shows all the images it found and the sites where they’re hosted. You can then go directly to those site to request the images be removed. When you’re done, do another request but this time to delete all your data. It’s easier to make rules for sharing in the future than to clean up the past. For younger children, this responsibility will fall on the adults around them. Only share images and videos of your children privately. The most secure way is in encrypted group chats like Apple’s iMessage or Signal. If you prefer the wider reach of social media, you can post family photos with their faces blurred out or use options that “disappear” like Instagram Stories. Clearly communicate your preferences to extended family members, like letting grandpa know you don’t want him sharing baby photos on Facebook. With high schools at the center of these early AI scandals, consider where students find photos of each other. As children join different programs, schools and activities, guardians will be given photo release forms to sign.

"The bill    by the Prince George’s lawmaker this fall was straightforward: a procedural change that would allow county council members to vote virtually if they are experiencing illness, parental leave or “a significant or unexpected factor or event” outside their control. Krystal Oriadha (D), who represents District 7, was eight months into her first pregnancy. The county’s health insurance plan didn’t cover birthing care in the county. And as a Black woman over 35, her pregnancy was considered high-risk. During meetings at county headquarters, she would munch on ice and pickles to quell her nausea, her swollen feet shoved into the neon sneakers that still fit. The bill    by the Prince George’s lawmaker this fall was straightforward: a procedural change that would allow county council members to vote virtually if they are experiencing illness, parental leave or “a significant or unexpected factor or event” outside their control. Krystal Oriadha (D), who represents District 7, was eight months into her first pregnancy. The county’s health insurance plan didn’t cover birthing care in the county. And as a Black woman over 35, her pregnancy was considered high-risk. During meetings at county headquarters, she would munch on ice and pickles to quell her nausea, her swollen feet shoved into the neon sneakers that still fit. But Oriadha, now 37, wanted to continue attending meetings, even if she couldn’t do so in person. Her fellow council members wouldn’t object, she thought, since the world had gotten used to conducting business over computers and smartphones during the pandemic. Plus, pregnancy and health-related reasons seemed sensible. She was wrong. Council member Calvin S. Hawkins II (D-At Large) accused her of “making yourself the victim.” The council rejected Oriadha’s request, drawing protests far beyond the county and grabbing the attention of prominent female politicians in the region. Weeks later, council members reversed themselves. Now, as she launches into a new term on the council that she helped reshape, the outspoken liberal — who became the first council member to give birth while in office — is focused on ensuring other pregnant people don’t experience the rough path she had. She gave birth to a boy, Ezra, in October, and quickly logged into a council meeting the following morning to be able to vote on bills she had introduced, concerned her proposals would die without her presence. She had always been able to fight for other people, she said. But, she noted, “the fight for the legislation for virtual vote was really the first time a piece of legislation was so directly connected to me and I felt like I was advocating for myself.” Oriadha first had an inkling she might be pregnant last winter, when she gagged on a sip of coffee on her way to the office. Becoming a mother wasn’t something she had envisioned before meeting her fiancé, Damian Newman. But there was room in the beautiful life she was building with him. She saved the pregnancy test and wrapped it up as one of his gifts for Valentine’s Day. She was shocked to learn that she was the first person ever to be publicly known to be pregnant while serving on the county council — and then, to find out that the county health insurance she’s on wouldn’t cover labor and delivery services in Prince George’s. Surely county employees deserved more choices, she thought. For much of Oriadha’s prenatal care, Newman would drive her to Silver Spring Medical Center in neighboring Montgomery County. As the birth drew near, she found herself confronted with further political disappointment while riding to a checkup in the passenger’s seat of Newman’s white Porsche Cayenne in late September. Days before, County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D)   on virtual voting as the council debated the issue, a position that could’ve carried more weight coming from her (another politician and a mother), Oriadha said. Newman dropped her off at the front door so she wouldn’t have to waddle far and rushed to join her inside. They disappeared into the other side of a wooden door and emerged with sonogram photos. The pregnancy hadn’t been easy. She had had to excuse herself from council and committee meetings to manage her symptoms — once failing to make it to the bathroom before her nausea flared (her team gave candles and thank you notes for cleaners on her floor for Christmas). Disconcerting updates throughout her pregnancy added a layer to the strain on Oriadha, who knew that maternal mortality rates in Prince George’s  , that the  and that federal data shows Black women are than White women to die from pregnancy-related complications. Though research has shown that higher levels of earning and education are linked to better birth outcomes for mothers and babies, those indicators aren’t the rule for Black moms. It was against this backdrop that Oriadha pushed for change. A win for her, she knew, would be a win for any council members in need of accommodations in the future. But she shouldn’t have had to fight for virtual voting in a liberal county, she thought. The reality of that was saddening. By the time Hawkins — shamed by politicians and voters alike — had apologized for his “victim” remark, Oriadha and her fiancé were focused on adding a rug to their nursery as her family made its way to Seat Pleasant from Texas for the birth and to support Oriadha afterward. She didn’t realize how much she needed them until they arrived. Tears flowed that night at Oriadha’s home as her mother whispered religious comforts and encouraged her to release her feelings. Oriadha soaked in the hugs and prayers as her due date neared and the council vote on virtual voting loomed. While public pressure had all but guaranteed a “yes,” the day of the vote was not without challenges for Oriadha. Before voting favorably for the resolution, council member Jolene Ivey (D-District 5) said on the rostrum that she had concerns about framing virtual voting as a women’s rights issue — an opinion Oriadha took personally. Ivey said that she didn’t want employers to get the wrong idea that they shouldn’t offer maternity leave and that she didn’t want women to feel guilty about taking it. The matter was a women’s right’s issue, Oriadha replied to Ivey, because she was a pregnant woman advocating for reasonable accommodations. But other council members had argued that accommodations shouldn’t be given and were indicative of poor governance. The pair continued debating in a side conversation after the council approved the measure, with Oriadha’s mother ultimately assuring Oriadha that she had fought for the right thing as Ivey looked on. Moments later, Oriadha sat glassy-eyed in her office under a Shirley Chisholm campaign poster, which hung under a stylized image of the late U.S. Rep. John Lewis and his famous “good trouble” quote, as a crowned picture of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg looked over her shoulder. “I just feel like she’s undermining women,” Oriadha said of Ivey. “There’s a lot of judgment for you to be pregnant, at the same time trying to serve. So the reality that we’re trying to create is [one] where that can’t exist, and that’s it.” Ivey told The Washington Post after the exchange that she had never spoken on the matter because she missed the first hearing on it. Ivey reiterated that what happened during the council was about voting access for elected leaders, noting that she is also a mother. “That’s all,” she said. “No drama for me. Drama for somebody.” Oriadha swallowed her annoyance, hopped on a call and then headed out of the Wayne K. Curry Administration Building doors with her family for the last doctor’s visit she would have before giving birth — not knowing what the clash with Ivey might cost her politically. Oriadha had spent months using her voice, warning her colleagues about   when they give birth. When it was time to welcome baby Ezra, Oriadha noticed she silenced herself in her pain. She doubted herself when the medical staff at an Anne Arundel County hospital checked her cervix once and told her she wasn’t in active labor and wouldn’t be for about 12 hours. Confused and in pain, Oriadha leaned on her mother, who said she also struggled to navigate the difference between what they were saying and what her daughter was experiencing. When water gushed from her body, Oriadha learned she had actually been in active labor for about 10 hours, and her contractions weren’t showing up on monitors because the baby was already in her cervix. Because of the misjudgment of her labor, she had to go without pain medication, which was originally part of her birthing plan. A new doctor came in to help deliver Ezra, whose crowning seemed to surprise medical staff. When he was placed in her arms, Oriadha said, the distress of what preceded faded. With all 6 lbs. 2 ozs. of him on her chest, she couldn’t see anything but him. “I just couldn’t believe he was here. He was so beautiful and fragile,” she said of the boy, who is named after her father. Less than 24 hours later, Oriadha flipped open her laptop to attend a council meeting. Wearing a hospital gown with an IV seen on one of her arms, she championed cannabis zoning legislation. “I don’t think I even got to really process the experience until days after because I was just like: ‘We’ll have to report this issue. I need to talk to the leadership of this institution. I need to make sure that this never happens to another Black woman,’” she said of her thought process after giving birth. “I need to get on video. I need to track these bills today.” The pain accompanying Ezra’s arrival crystallized for Oriadha things she knew to be true but had now experienced. As a well-educated Black woman in a leadership position in a majority-Black county, she, too, could have a traumatizing birthing experience. “My title doesn’t matter, my education doesn’t matter, my economic status doesn’t matter,” she said, straining to hold back tears, to no avail. “In those moments, I’m just a Black woman that they see, and whatever biases that they hold can come out … and that in those moments, they have all the power.” She’s filed a complaint with the hospital, hoping for  better outcomes for people coming after her, she said. On the last council session day in November, Oriadha brought Ezra with her to work. He sat in the audience nestled in the arms of his grandmother as Oriadha made trips between the dais and a news conference announcing the launch of a guaranteed-basic-income pilot that she had fought for. Ezra maneuvered a bit to find a comfortable spot to rest in Oriadha’s arms once the session was over as she posed for pictures on the dais. Many of her colleagues who had originally opposed virtual voting were absent — but voted virtually that day. “I really wanted to capture this moment,” she said of her first day physically back in the office about four weeks after giving birth. “Everything passes by, but I wanted to be able to show him one day [that he was here with me].” Things are different now. Ivey, once a part of Oriadha’s coalition on the council, became council chair this month with the power to set the agenda heading into 2024. While Oriadha pledged to continue working with her, Ivey did not appoint her to lead any committees in the upcoming year. (Council member Wala Blegay [D-District 6], another vocal member of the council’s more-liberal wing, also wasn’t appointed to a committee leadership role.) With Ezra in her life, Oriadha said she is in a season where she must become more prudent and discerning, which includes advocating for herself and her constituents in a way that she feels her family remains the priority. Instead of showing up at every community event a constituent invites her to, Oriadha considers her capacity. The thought of rest doesn’t bring on a feeling of guilt or anxiety that she should be doing something. Vacations and time with friends, she’s noticed, are just as important. Ezra’s entrance has ushered in an era in her life where she feels like she can speak up for others — but also for herself. “As a Black woman, I’ve been told I can’t have it all,” she said. “I can be a good wife, a good mother and a good politician.” The days of being one of the first on-site and the last to leave are gone, she said. “I don’t want to be absent. I’m not going to get this time back, and this moment isn’t going to last forever,” she said. “The legacy is going to be the policy and the programs I put forth. … I think I’m finally at a place in my life where I really believe that.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/29/prince-georges-county-pregnant-virtual-voting-krystal-oriadha/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 06:00:00,
"Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows on Thursday ruled that Donald Trump could not be on the ballot for the Republican primary elections in Maine on constitutional grounds, a ruling that will probably face legal challenge.

"D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) introduced legislation Thursday that would launch on a pair of gun violence reduction strategies that national criminal justice experts recommended to the District more than a year ago — the latest legislative proposal in a year in which soaring violent crime put council members under pressure to show residents they are taking action. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) introduced legislation Thursday that would launch on a pair of gun violence reduction strategies that national criminal justice experts recommended to the District more than a year ago — the latest legislative proposal in a year in which soaring violent crime put council members under pressure to show residents they are taking action. Mendelson has long argued that legislation is not the sole solution to reducing crime and that police and the mayor’s office bear most of that responsibility. Now, his bill would order the executive to move forward with crime-fighting strategies that are largely already within the mayor and police department’s power. It is Mendelson’s most direct action on crime all year. “The mayor talks about, ‘well, the council needs to do things.’ All right. So we’ve identified five different strategies with this bill, four of which the mayor can do, but she hasn’t. So we’ll legislate it,” Mendelson said. Mendelson’s bill would create a gun violence intervention initiative and take a new approach to blighted properties that attract crime, the two proposals that were part of recommendations made to the District last year. It would also seek to free up law enforcement officers by allowing D.C. police to hire civilians to investigate property crimes and cold cases. It would gather and make public data on repeat violent offenders that Mendelson said he hoped could help illuminate breakdowns in the justice system. Lastly, it would allow the District to seek Medicaid reimbursement for community services often offered to those involved in or victimized by gun violence, leveraging federal funds. Mendelson said his gun violence intervention initiative would involve a “focused deterrence” strategy intended to supplement existing programs. That strategy, modeled after others found to be successful in cities such as Boston, would be led by law enforcement officials who would target crime deterrence efforts on the relatively small percentage of repeat offenders responsible for a disproportionate amount of violent crime. He said it is distinct from programs already in place such as interrupters, who are not law enforcement but people with lived experience who try to steer residents away from crime, and   which does seek to identify people at risk of committing violence, although Mendelson questioned its effectiveness. “Even though there has been talk about this for years, I have yet to see a focused deterrence strategy or focused deterrence approach in the District,” Mendelson said. “I think the District has been flailing at approaches toward reducing gun violence and not being as aggressive as they need to be with some of these strategies.” A spokeswoman for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s office said the mayor’s team is reviewing Mendelson’s legislation but did not address Mendelson’s claims. It’s unclear how Mendelson’s proposal would interact with existing programs. In May, Bowser (D) ordered a review of every violence intervention and gun violence prevention program in the District, with the goal of consolidating efforts into a more coordinated strategy and discarding ineffective approaches. The results of that review have yet to be released. Mendelson said he did not consult with public safety officials or City Administrator Kevin Donahue, who is overseeing the review and has said about 100 violence-prevention-related initiatives, activities and programs have been identified across 20 agencies. Mendelson said he would seek feedback during future hearings. The bill’s new approach to addressing blight would target specific properties that attract crime and authorize the mayor to take corrective action at the property owner’s expense. The city has the ability to compel repairs at blighted properties, but Mendelson said “passive” approaches such as raising taxes on a property as a penalty for skipping ordered repairs do not produce the desired result. “This adds an element that the property is criminal, then it gives the mayor authority to step in and abate the property as contributing toward criminal activity,” Mendelson said. Mendelson drew the proposal, plus the gun violence intervention initiative, from a   that put forth ideas that have worked in jurisdictions nationwide. The report, from the National Institute of Criminal Justice Reform, was   but never fully implemented. It described D.C. as “lacking the political commitment, coordination, and a coherent strategy to reduce gun violence” — despite having the tools at its disposal to create one. “Watching these strategies not being implemented and knowing that they can make a difference, I’m fed up with the inaction,” Mendelson said. Spokespeople for D.C. police did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the department’s position on the legislation, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office said the office had not been able to immediately review the bill and could not comment. Mendelson’s plan joins a growing collection of legislative proposals aimed at increasing public safety in the city as a violent year comes to a close. D.C. is on track to have its worst homicide count since 1997, with 265 killings so far. While some including the  and reacted negatively to his proposal, others applauded it as a robust, targeted approach to tackle the violence. The DC Justice Lab, a criminal justice reform advocacy group, said Mendelson’s bill — and other recent proposals such as the Whole of Government Response to Crime Act from Council member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) — “provides a framework for the kind of transformative change that D.C. desperately needs.” “By incorporating recommendations with a proven track record of success both here and in other jurisdictions, such as focused deterrence strategies, these bills acknowledge the complex nature of crime and the multifaceted approach required to address it effectively,” the organization said in a statement. Mendelson for much of the year was besieged by what he called an unfair   about crime, an accusation that had blared on the national stage after Mendelson told members of Congress in March that “there is not a crime crisis in Washington, D.C.” The quote —   in its response to Mendelson on Thursday — became part of a year-long narrative suggesting Mendelson and his colleagues didn’t grasp the urgency of the crime problem. Lawmakers’ frustration reached a fever pitch   when multiple council members, including Mendelson, said they were tired of that perception and were committed to responding. They then passed emergency legislation by a vote of 12-1 that expanded pretrial detention for those charged with violent crimes and created a new offense for firing a gun in public — then proceeded to introduce additional public safety bills this fall. Council member Brooke Pinto (D-Ward 2), chair of the public safety committee,  that would increase penalties for gun crimes, require judges to issue written explanations if they release someone charged with a violent crime on bond, and — most controversially because of racial profiling concerns — allow police to perform random, warrantless searches on people who have been charged with or convicted of violent crimes. White has proposed new staff positions to coordinate victim services and programs intended to provide rehabilitative services to young people; incentives to hire staff at the D.C. crime lab, although it remains unaccredited; and more granular firearms tracking data, among other things. Multiple members, including Pinto, White, Brianne K. Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), have bills that would enhance staffing at the troubled 911 call center. And another from Bowser, the  , would create a new felony offense for “organized retail theft” and would revive a War on Drugs-era idea to create temporary “anti-loitering drug-free zones,” intended to disrupt open-air drug dealing, she has said. She is also urging the council to approve a broader, permanent version of the emergency crime legislation that passed over the summer, Bowser’s Safer Stronger Amendment Act. “These strong anti-crime bills were written in partnership with residents and law enforcement to combat crime, ensure accountability and keep DC residents safe,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “While our team continues to review the chairman’s legislation, the administration is calling on the Council to take immediate action to pass these critical pieces of legislation already before them.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/21/dc-crime-bill-mendelson/,Washington Post,2023-12-21 17:53:00,
"Nine years after bidding farewell to a certain franchise legend, the New York Yankees welcomed another shortstop named Jeter to their organization. This time, it’s Jeter Downs, a 25-year-old infielder who was designated for assignment last week by the Washington Nationals. A native of Colombia named after Derek Jeter, Downs was claimed off waivers Tuesday by the one team able to help him fulfill his apparent destiny of donning pinstripes. Nine years after bidding farewell to a certain franchise legend, the New York Yankees welcomed another shortstop named Jeter to their organization. This time, it’s Jeter Downs, a 25-year-old infielder who was designated for assignment last week by the Washington Nationals. A native of Colombia named after Derek Jeter, Downs was claimed off waivers Tuesday by the one team able to help him fulfill his apparent destiny of donning pinstripes. It remains to be seen if the once highly regarded prospect can get his career back on track with the Yankees, but with the acquisition, they have already accomplished one non-trivial objective: annoying the heck out of Boston Red Sox fans. Downs was the piece that   the 2020 trade that sent Mookie Betts, the 2018 American League MVP,  . In exchange for a versatile, vastly talented player who was just 27 at the time, the Red Sox received Downs, catcher Connor Wong and outfielder Alex Verdugo. With the Yankees having   this month in a rare trade with the Red Sox, they now have two-thirds of Boston’s haul for a much smaller fraction of the price. In the wake of Tuesday’s news, it is not publicly known if Jeter (Derek) has reached out to his  . When Downs was set to make his major league debut for Boston in June 2022, Jeter noted on social media that he had met the young infielder a few years earlier. “Congratulations and good luck … unless you are playing the Yankees,” Jeter   then. Jeter Downs was named by his parents after Derek Jeter in Colombia in 1998.  He hit his first major league home run at Yankee Stadium.  Of course, he’s now a Yankee.   If Downs, who also has experience at second base and third base, wants to spend much time playing   the Yankees, he will need to recapture more of the batting prowess that made him an exciting prospect at the time of the Betts trade, after the Cincinnati Reds made him a first-round draft pick three years earlier. (As an aside, when the Reds   in 2017, it provided a painful reminder to Cincinnati fans that their team passed on Jeter in the 1992 draft to use the fifth pick on journeyman outfielder Chad Mottola, allowing the Yankees to pounce on their future captain with the next pick.) Acquired by the Dodgers in a 2018   that netted Cincinnati Yasiel Puig, Matt Kemp and others, Downs posted impressive minor league numbers the following year, including a 1.116 OPS over 12 games with Los Angeles’s Class AA affiliate. After the Betts trade, Downs and other minor leaguers saw their 2020 season   by the pandemic, and when he returned to action it was not with the same success. Over two seasons and 180 plate appearances with Boston’s Class AAA affiliate, Downs batted .193 with a .292 on-base percentage and a .368 slugging percentage. In his first major league stint, composed of 14 games and 41 plate appearances for the Red Sox last year, his slash line was an anemic .154/.171/.256. As fate would have it, one of Downs’s most memorable moments in Boston was when he notched his first major league hit and RBI in a July 2022 game against the Yankees — then scored the winning run in extra innings on a base hit by Verdugo. “It’s pretty ironic that this just happened,” Downs   at the time while referencing Jeter’s tweet. “I got my first hit against them [and] the winning run, so this is insane. You can’t write a better story.” Claimed   a year ago after Boston designated him for assignment, Downs’s hitting numbers at Class AAA Rochester improved only slightly, although he did manage a 1.067 OPS in just nine plate appearances with the big league club. He’ll want that trajectory to stay on an upward path, and if it does, Downs might have Yankees fans once again chanting, “Let’s go, Jeter!”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/19/jeter-downs-yankees/,Washington Post,2023-12-19 21:14:00,

In findings announced Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces said that the shooting deaths of three Israeli hostages by IDF soldiers this month as they attempted to identify themselves “could have been prevented” and that airstrikes this week are likely to have caused unintentional harm to civilians.  The probes address the main points of criticism of the Israeli campaign, both domestically — the government’s failure to protect and secure the release of the hostages remaining in the Gaza Strip — and internationally — the catastrophic civilian toll in the enclave. Israeli forces have killed more than 21,500 people in Gaza and wounded more than 55,000 in the past three months, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel launched the campaign after   and allied fighters overran communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The Biden administration, while supportive of the Israeli campaign to eradicate the Islamist militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza, has pressured the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do more to minimize civilian deaths in the enclave. Israeli fighter jets on Dec. 24 attacked targets at the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza.  , the director of al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said. The IDF said Thursday that it was targeting “Hamas operatives” but that an initial investigation had “revealed that additional buildings located near the targets were also hit … which likely caused unintended harm to additional uninvolved civilians.” The IDF did not expand on why the strikes were so destructive, but a military official told the Israeli public broadcaster Kan that “the weaponry did not match the nature of the attack, so extensive collateral damage was caused.” In a U.S. intelligence assessment released this month, analysts found that almost half of the munitions Israel had used in Gaza were unguided bombs — which can miss a target by up to 100 feet. Israel has rejected international calls for a cease-fire. “Whoever talks about stopping — there is no such thing,” Netanyahu told soldiers in northern Gaza this week. “We are not stopping. The war will continue until the end, until we finish it. No less.” Family members of hostages who are still being held in the enclave worry that the Israeli campaign is putting their loved ones in greater danger. Hamas released 110 hostages last month in exchange for the Israeli release of Palestinians detained in the West Bank, but more than 100 hostages remain — or have been killed — in Gaza. When the IDF troops killed the three Israel hostages this month, Lior Peri told The Washington Post, “we were terrified to see our greatest fear become a reality.” His 79-year-old father, Chaim, is still in Gaza. The IDF said Thursday that the soldiers “carried out the right action to the best of their understanding of the event at that moment” but that the deaths “could have been prevented.” Israeli troops raiding buildings in Gaza City on Dec. 10  , the IDF said. They assessed it to be a  , a tactic that Israel says the group has used. On Dec. 14, soldiers saw signs that read “SOS” and “save three kidnapped people.” The next day, an IDF soldier saw three people — all shirtless, one of them waving a white flag — and opened fire, killing two. Commanders ordered a stop to the shooting. The third person reemerged, and one soldier shot and killed him. The IDF said the soldier didn’t hear the order to stop. “It should not have happened,” Tal Heinrich, a spokeswoman for the prime minister’s office, said Friday. “We learned difficult lessons, and our forces are implementing the lessons that we learned.” Miri Eisin, director of the International Institute for Counterterrorism at Reichman University, said the investigations are evidence that the IDF is holding itself accountable. “You need to make sure soldiers understand the depth of the actions that they take,” said Eisin, a colonel in the IDF reserves. “When you go beyond what you’re allowed to do, you need to call yourself out.” The killings of the three hostages outraged Israelis. Thousands   to call on Netanyahu to do more to bring the other hostages home. Hamas has said it will release more hostages only when the fighting ends.  “There will be no prisoner swap deal nor negotiations under fire until the Israeli aggression ends,” Bassem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau in Doha, Qatar, said in a video statement. “Meanwhile, we can say we are open to any initiative that can end this Israeli genocidal war.” A strike near Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah on Thursday killed at least 18 people and wounded dozens, the hospital’s director said. An estimated 100,000 Gazans, displaced by fighting in the north,  . They are struggling with shortages of water, food and shelter; insufficient aid; and continuing bombardment. “I escaped death, only to find the situation here equally perilous,” said Ihab Al-Daya, who fled central Gaza to shelter in Rafah. “There is no water, no food, and nowhere to sleep,” he said. “Shells are constantly being fired at us.” The plight of Gazan civilians, pushed by the military campaign into shrinking spaces within the already cramped enclave, has stirred protests around the world. But the Israeli government faces little pressure domestically to ease up. Israeli disapproval of the government is high, but so is support for the war. Still, some Israelis are calling for an end to hostilities. Hundreds rallied in Tel Aviv on Thursday evening to demand a cease-fire. “I came to protest two main things,” Oren Ben Natan said. “Firstly, how our government abandoned 108 hostages who are still held by Hamas. And second, the massacre in Gaza.” The 24-year-old held a sign that read “There is no security without a political solution.” “Beyond it being a horrifying war crime,” Ben Natan said, “it is 100 percent clear to me that this will not lead us to peace and quiet, but onto the next round, which will be deadlier, to both Israelis and Palestinians alike.” Across the street, onlookers shouted curses at the demonstrators.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/29/israel-gaza-investigation-hamas-hostage/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 16:46:00,
"A wrongful-death lawsuit claims Commanders players Benjamin St-Juste and Jamin Davis, along with former player Deshazor Everett, were racing their cars the night Everett’s longtime girlfriend, Olivia Peters, was killed in a car crash. Peters’s mother, Kathleen Peters, filed the lawsuit in Loudoun County Circuit Court on Dec. 22, seeking $25 million in damages and a jury trial. The suit alleges the defendants “came together and conspired and planned to engage in unlawful and criminal behavior” and that “Everett’s actions in speeding and driving recklessly in furtherance of the conspiracy were a direct and proximate cause” of Peters’s injuries and death.

Peters’s mother, Kathleen Peters, filed the lawsuit in Loudoun County Circuit Court on Dec. 22, seeking $25 million in damages and a jury trial.

He was ejected from the car, and Peters was trapped inside. She was removed from the vehicle and transported to StoneSprings Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead from internal bleeding. Everett suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries. The Commanders and the NFL declined to comment on the lawsuit, as did Mark Dycio and Kaveh Noorishad, attorneys for St-Juste, Davis and Everett. The lawsuit alleges that Everett, St-Juste and Davis, who were all on Washington’s roster at the time, planned that evening “to ‘show off’ and race their cars on the public roads.” According to the lawsuit, Everett’s car was equipped with nitrous oxide, which can boost a car’s horsepower and is illegal in Virginia, along with racing tires and a roll cage. Davis drove a McLaren, and St-Juste drove a customized Audi A6. The suit claims the three met at an auto shop in Loudoun County owned by fellow defendant Shahidul Islam, then went driving. Everett had a GoPro Camera attached to his car, recording the events. According to the suit, the defendants “drove at high rates of speed well in excess of the posted speed limits,” “changed lanes erratically and without signaling,” “crossed over double yellow lines and drove in the opposite lane of traffic” and “raced each other on multiple occasions.” The defendants exchanged text messages and had conversations on the phone and in person “concerning their illegal and reckless conduct, specifically racing,” according to the lawsuit. At one point in the evening, the lawsuit states, Everett said: “I told them it was fast, but they didn’t believe me. So, I was just trying to go out and show them.” The Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office’s initial report found Everett had been driving more than 90 mph before the crash. But the Loudoun County crash reconstruction team, using evidence from the black box and witness accounts, later painted a different picture of the scene, according to Everett’s sentencing memo. St-Juste told police Everett had been traveling about 50 mph. Everett was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter but pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving and was  . His license was also suspended, and he was ordered to pay a fine, perform community service and produce a public service announcement about safe driving. Davis was charged with reckless driving (89 mph in a 65-mph zone) four days before the crash. The charge was reduced to an infraction. Three months after the crash, Davis was charged again with reckless driving, this time on allegations he was driving his McLaren 114 mph in a 45-mph zone. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 days of jail time, but he appealed and is awaiting another hearing, scheduled for March 4.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/stjuste-davis-everett-wrongful-death/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 15:59:00,
"With the glare of the November elections fading, voters in Northern Virginia’s 10th Congressional District are set to be flooded with campaign brochures, TV ads and knocks on their doors by candidates looking to discuss the 2024 race. So far, 11 Democrats and two Republicans are seeking their party’s nomination in June, hoping to succeed Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), who has announced that she is   for health reasons. With the glare of the November elections fading, voters in Northern Virginia’s 10th Congressional District are set to be flooded with campaign brochures, TV ads and knocks on their doors by candidates looking to discuss the 2024 race. So far, 11 Democrats and two Republicans are seeking their party’s nomination in June, hoping to succeed Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.), who has announced that she is   for health reasons. The crowded field underscores the fact that the congressional district Wexton turned blue after defeating then-Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) in 2018 will again become competitive in what will be a highly charged 2024 presidential election, political analysts say. “Virginia 10 is a more competitive district than most and, as such, it represents a rare opportunity for both parties to challenge for a pivotal House seat in a pivotal state,” said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. “The Washington area is full of highly political people who salivate at opportunities like this.” Some of the contenders already have wide name recognition in the state, giving them an advantage in the nomination contests, for which early voting begins May 3. Among Democrats, former Virginia House speaker   and Del.   are both prodigious fundraisers from Fairfax County with powerful connections inside their party. The two Republican contenders — Brooke Taylor and Mike Clancy — both ran for Wexton’s seat in 2022, allowing them some familiarity with voters in the district, which is anchored in Loudoun County but stretches into Fairfax, Prince William, Fauquier and Rappahannock counties. Others have a steeper path toward victory. Among them, Travis Nembhard is the most recent entry into the Democratic field. Nembhard announced his bid this month after losing a race for state delegate in November to Republican Ian Lovejoy in what became one of the state’s most expensive contests, with Nembhard raising  $2.4 million and Lovejoy $1.8 million.  Nembhard, 35, said he intends to distinguish himself from his Democratic competitors by emphasizing his background as a son of Jamaican immigrants who, after graduating law school, worked the graveyard shift making doughnuts at Dunkin’ while volunteering as an assistant U.S. attorney in New York for eight months in 2013. “It wasn’t easy, but it was the one way I could afford to do what I love and that is helping to combat injustice and help everyday people,” said Nembhard, who is now the division chief for D.C.’s Department of For-Hire Vehicles. “It opened my eyes to having an unlivable wage. Even with a minimum wage, that wasn’t enough and I didn’t have kids back then.” If elected, Nembhard says, he plans to fight to codify   protections, strengthen policies combating climate change and expand gun-control laws. Atif Qarni, Virginia’s former education secretary, also has less name recognition than some of his competitors — despite the statewide office he held under former governor Ralph Northam (D). Qarni, who now teaches a class on the politics of American education at George Mason University, says the time he spent in that office touring every locality in the state gives him a deeper understanding of Virginia’s needs than his opponents. Among other things, Qarni said, he intends to push for more federal educational funding to allow for universal prekindergarten programs, a universal school lunch program and a “more meaningful” student loan forgiveness program. “There are excellent candidates running in this district,” Qarni, 45, said. “I’m one individual that, to my knowledge, has actually represented the whole state.” The other Democrats in the race include: state Sen.  ; Dels.  ,   and  ; George Mason University librarian Mark Leighton; Brandon Garay, a legislative affairs specialist at the Defense Department; and Krystle Kaul, founder of a defense technology company. Among the Republicans, Clancy — an executive with Oracle global technology company — has so far been the most active, holding fundraisers and posting on social media about his campaign to “restore America.” “We are losing our country; you know it, and I know it,” Clancy, whose campaign did not respond to an interview request, says in a   announcing his candidacy. Highlighting his background as the son of a U.S. Air Force sergeant who worked his way through college and law school, he says in the video: “Believe me when I say: I know what it’s like to struggle to make ends meet.” Taylor, whose campaign also did not respond to an interview request, has not been active so far. Her campaign   highlights her experience as a defense industry subcontractor. In 2022, after the 10th District was redrawn the year before to extend to the southwest, Wexton easily beat Republican Hung Cao by 6.5 percentage points. Before that, voters in the district favored former governor Terry McAuliffe (D) over Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) by 1.6 points and   over former president   by 19 points. With Wexton leaving, the race to replace her is more open, particularly among the crowded Democratic field, said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. More mainstream candidates might split support from voters, leaving room for another candidate with more extreme positions to squeeze through in a nomination contest, Rozell said. “All one person has to do is get more votes than the second-place finisher,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/16/wexton-10th-congressional-district-crowded/,Washington Post,2023-12-16 06:00:00,

The court on Wednesday granted Apple that  . That means Apple is allowed to resume selling Apple Watch models with blood oxygen tracking features — the Watch Ultra 2 and the Watch Series 9 — direct to consumers. The company confirmed both devices would be available for sale in Apple retail stores Wednesday, and on its website by Thursday at 12 p.m. Pacific time. “We are pleased the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stayed the exclusion order while it considers our request to stay the order pending our full appeal,” the company said in a statement. The court’s decision is a notable win for Apple, but is far from complete. Apple has also requested a longer pause in the ban’s enforcement while an appeal process plays out, citing the company’s potential to “suffer irreparable harm” because of its inability to sell its “most popular” smartwatch models.

"Days after   as his long-term home with a record-breaking contract, another Japanese superstar reportedly decided to do the same. Late Thursday night, reports indicated 25-year-old ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto agreed to join Ohtani in Los Angeles. Yamamoto, who has never thrown an MLB pitch but sparked one of the more all-inclusive bicoastal bidding wars in recent years, reportedly agreed to a 12-year deal worth $325 million, the most money guaranteed to a starting pitcher in a single contract in major league history. Days after   as his long-term home with a record-breaking contract, another Japanese superstar reportedly decided to do the same. Late Thursday night, reports indicated 25-year-old ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto agreed to join Ohtani in Los Angeles. Yamamoto, who has never thrown an MLB pitch but sparked one of the more all-inclusive bicoastal bidding wars in recent years, reportedly agreed to a 12-year deal worth $325 million, the most money guaranteed to a starting pitcher in a single contract in major league history. If those figures are finalized — and with the deal pending a physical, the team had yet to make the signing official by Friday night — the Dodgers will have committed more than $1 billion to the Samurai Japan teammates, both of whom pitched in   on American soil nine months ago. Yamamoto’s deal, worth a total of $375 million once the posting fee to his Japanese team is factored in, cements the Dodgers’ place as MLB’s most envied free-spending behemoths. Just last week, they   $136.5 million to right-hander Tyler Glasnow in an extension that was part of a deal to acquire the starter from Tampa Bay. But the Dodgers were bidding against themselves for Glasnow, who will help anchor a remade rotation that should also include Walker Buehler in his first year back from Tommy John surgery. They were bidding against almost every major market team for Yamamoto, who reportedly   when he visited the Bronx and who   after the billionaire flew to Japan to court him. In other words, given the choice to sign just about anywhere, two of the biggest stars available this winter chose to be Dodgers, and the Dodgers were willing to pay whatever it took to reward them for it. The Dodgers laid relatively low as a few years of chatter about Cohen’s deep pockets and the San Diego Padres’ profligacy signaled to some that the balance of baseball power might be shifting — or, at least, redistributing itself across a bigger area than just Chavez Ravine. Now, with Yamamoto joining Glasnow and Buehler in a rotation that might also include Ohtani, Dustin May and Tony Gonsolin when they are healthy and Ohtani joining former MVPs Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman in the lineup, the Dodgers are again the team to beat, likely to be resented around the sport because it is getting increasingly difficult to imagine beating them. If there is any consolation for the non-Los Angeles based baseball masses, it might be that the Dodgers do not necessarily know exactly what Yamamoto will give them. They, like the Yankees and Mets and San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies and other reputable baseball franchises, seemed to believe the righty’s success in Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan will translate to MLB. The 5-foot-10 fireballer has a high-90s fastball and pinpoint control of a curveball and splitter that made him one of the more dominant pitchers in Japanese baseball history. While his slight frame raised concerns for some MLB evaluators, Yamamoto dispelled any notion of fragility with a history of durability; In his last NPB outing, which came in Game 6 of the Japan Series this year, Yamamoto threw 138 pitches and struck out 14. But committing so much guaranteed money to Yamamoto is a gamble. The only starter to come close was Gerrit Cole, whom the Yankees signed for $324 million over 10 years. The next largest guaranteed contract for a starter was  . Big guarantees for inherently fragile starters are always huge risks, though it is worth noting that because Yamamoto’s deal stretches over 12 years as opposed to Cole’s nine, the average annual value of Yamamoto’s deal is far from record breaking. The Dodgers are committing roughly $27 million annually to him, just more than they agreed to pay Glasnow, just more than the Yankees committed annually to Carlos Rodón in free agency last year. And while Los Angeles seemingly can spend with abandon under any circumstances, the structure of Ohtani’s deal,  , meant the Dodgers had cash on hand. They have committed more than $50 million annually to Glasnow and Yamamoto since Ohtani signed. So the rest of MLB is facing a new and intimidating incarnation of the Dodgers, who were already one of the more dominant franchises of the last decade, who are unbothered by concerns about cable revenue facing many other teams because of their massive long-term television deal, and who seem to be able to draw and keep the game’s biggest stars at will. To the extent that they had surrendered their spot as envied league villains, they have certainly signed a long-term lease there now. But they know better than anyone that even villains cannot count on October triumphs: For all their years of superteam building over the past decade, the Dodgers won just one World Series,  , as teams that spent far less achieved as much or more. Yamamoto might just be their ace for the next Dodgers generation. But the previous one knows exactly how little even the biggest stockpiles of star power can truly guarantee.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/22/yoshinobu-yamamoto-dodgers/,Washington Post,2023-12-22 13:25:00,

Joel Castón made history in 2021, becoming the first incarcerated person to win elected office in D.C. Two years later, he could make history again by becoming the first formerly incarcerated person to serve on the D.C. Sentencing Commission. Castón, who spent 27 years in prison for the   of an 18-year-old man in a shooting in a D.C. parking lot in 1994, spoke at a hearing Wednesday for a potential appointment for the sentencing commission. “I look forward to contributing to judicious sentencing guidance that promote justice, compassion and the betterment of all people in Washington, D.C.,” Castón said in prepared remarks to the D.C. Council on Wednesday. “If confirmed, I would be a fierce advocate for sentences that balance accountability, public well-being and human dignity.” The resolution to appoint Castón to the sentencing commission was first presented to the council in October. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said at a second hearing Thursday that he hopes to present the consideration of Castón before the council Jan. 9. While serving his sentence, Castón   was the first incarcerated individual elected to public office in Washington when he won an advisory neighborhood commissioner seat in 2021 to represent the city’s Hill East neighborhood. That area includes the D.C. jail on 19th Street SE where Castón was incarcerated. His overarching goal in that role, he said at the time, was to change the public narrative about incarcerated people. Attempts to contact Castón were not immediately successful. A spokesman for the sentencing commission said that, if confirmed, Castón would be the first former inmate to serve on the commission. Mendelson said Wednesday that the council established the commission to “review and analyze pertinent sentencing data, policies and practices in the District of Columbia, to submit an annual report to the council summarizing the commission’s activities, and review and research sentencing practices locally and nationally, and to make recommendations to the council that increase the fairness and effectiveness of criminal sentencing policies and practices in the District of Columbia.” The commission works as an independent agency within D.C. government and also conducts focus groups and other activities to collect and disseminate information about sentencing guidelines. The sentencing commission’s role will probably undergo more scrutiny as the District grapples with rising homicide numbers, and some  . Mendelson praised Castón’s civic involvement in a statement, saying he “is well regarded, a former publicly elected ANC commissioner and has demonstrated his commitment to the community as a returning citizen. Additionally, he studied criminal justice while incarcerated for more than 20 years. And the sentencing commission indicated they wanted a member who has experienced the criminal justice system.” When asked during the hearing by Mendelson how he would contribute to the commission, Castón said he would do so “in a fair and just manner.” Castón said he applauded the council for “allowing him to be a part of something very important for all Washingtonians.” “As a native Washingtonian who has been directly impacted by the criminal legal system, I am humbled to take on the critical responsibility that this position entails,” Castón said. “I take this duty incredibly seriously and will bring my diverse background and experiences to inform thoughtful, ethical decisions on complex sentencing issues facing our city. I step into this position keenly aware of that responsibility.” Castón also said the sentencing commission plays an integral role in determining sentencing policies that impact the lives of residents and shape the justice system. When asked by Mendelson whether he believes there are any issues with the guidelines, Castón said that he judiciously studied the sentencing guidelines and city’s criminal code during his incarceration. “One thing that I saw that jumps out to me is the disparity in sentencing within our guidelines, which I was more so very thankful that we’re rewriting them to become more current,” Castón said. If appointed, Castón would serve a four-year term to end July 2, 2026, replacing Molly M. Gill, who served on the commission from October 2021 to June 2023. “Thank you for welcoming me to this commission.

The Ravens’ perch may not be comfortable, though. They lead the Miami Dolphins in the race for the AFC’s top seed and, conveniently enough, host the Dolphins on New Year’s Eve. Behind Jackson, a strong MVP possibility, Baltimore has yet to lose two games in a row — and in each of its three losses, the decisive points came after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter (with one coming in overtime). Here’s a look at some interesting facts entering Week 17.  Cue the “Is Joe Flacco elite?” conversations. Cleveland’s quarterback is tied with Tom Brady for the most road playoff wins in NFL history (seven). Cleveland has 10 wins and Detroit has 11, a historically significant tidbit because the last season in which both teams had at least 10 wins was 1953 — when the two met in the NFL championship game, with the Lions winning, 17-16.

Miami found a way to win differently on Christmas Eve, beating Dallas with a performance more gritty than glittering and relying on Jason Sanders to kick five field goals.

Jacksonville quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft, has more career interceptions (37, including five this month) than New England’s Mac Jones (36), the 15th pick in 2021.  The Rams arrived at their Week 10 bye with a 3-6 record and had lost 18 of 26 games since winning Super Bowl LVI. They’ve been  , winning five of six games overall (with the only loss coming in overtime in Baltimore) while averaging 433.8 yards and 32.4 points over the past five.  Philadelphia has a one-game lead in the NFC East and faces an easier path to the division title than Dallas. After this game, the Eagles play the Giants; Dallas must play a strong Detroit team Saturday before finishing the regular season at Washington.  Baker Mayfield is 4-0 in December, passing for 1,010 yards and nine touchdowns with only one interception. Tampa Bay can secure the NFC South title with one win in the final two weeks. Its regular season finale is at Carolina.  Kyle Shanahan is 0-38 when trailing by eight or more points going into the fourth quarter. Last week, Brock Purdy became the first 49ers quarterback since Colin Kaepernick in 2015 to throw four interceptions.  Mason Rudolph became the first Steelers quarterback to pass for 250 or more yards and two or more touchdowns in a game since Ben Roethlisberger in 2021 — the last season in which Rudolph previously started a game. George Pickens finished with 4 receptions for 195 yards & 2 TDs on 6 targets while generating career-highs in receiving yards over expected (+139) & YAC over expected (+90). Pickens’ +139 receiving YOE are the 3rd-most in a game by any receiver since 2018.  |     After a disastrous start to the season, Denver looked promising but has been doomed by four terrible losses at home by a total of 16 points to the Raiders, Commanders, Jets and Patriots — teams with 21 wins among them.  In the Christmas loss, Kansas City handed the Raiders two defensive touchdowns seven seconds apart in the second quarter (on a lost fumble by Patrick Mahomes on a gadget play and on Mahomes’s 14th interception of the season). While Mahomes and his wide receivers have struggled, tight end Travis Kelce hasn’t been a reliable weapon. Often double- and triple-teamed, he hasn’t had more than 100 receiving yards since Oct. 22 and hasn’t scored since Nov. 20. The Chiefs are not good enough to play shotgun drop back football on a play by play basis anywhere except QB. They have to protect their tackles more and hand it off. They need to help their skill group get open by using more PAP. They have to help their weaknesses not expose…  Jordan Love has a better touchdown-interception figure through 16 weeks (27-11) than Patrick Mahomes (26-14). The banged-up team that emerges as the winner has a chance to earn a playoff spot on the final Sunday of the season, when Minnesota visits Detroit and Green Bay hosts Chicago.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/28/nfl-week-17-key-things/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 18:02:00,

"Whether D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s administration will implement a council budget directive to increase food assistance benefits by nearly   remains an open question heading into the new year, despite assertions from lawmakers and advocacy groups that failing to do so would violate city law. The back-and-forth over the temporary boost to the city’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program comes months after the D.C.

Bowser’s administration will implement a council budget directive to increase food assistance benefits by nearly   remains an open question heading into the new year, despite assertions from lawmakers and advocacy groups that failing to do so would violate city law. The back-and-forth over the temporary boost to the city’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program comes months after the D.C. Council passed a budget provision to boost those benefits by 10 percent from January to September 2024 if there was   at the end of fiscal 2023. But weeks after D.C.’s chief financial officer   those funds were indeed available, Bowser’s administration said it would   to move forward with the council’s plan, citing significant spending and staffing constraints faced by the District’s Department of Human Services, which facilitates several key social service programs. In recent weeks, those who disagree with the Bowser administration’s rationale have ramped up the pressure. Council member Janeese Lewis George (D-Ward 4), who introduced the budget provision, last week posted a Dec. 13   from the city’s Office of the Attorney General on X, formerly Twitter, that cast doubt on whether Bowser’s office had the authority to disregard the council’s budgetary mandate. “Because the statutory language with respect to the SNAP benefit increase is mandatory, and it has been included in an approved budget plan, the Mayor must expend the funds as the Council directed and cannot unilaterally use them for other purposes,” the  from the Office of the Attorney General reads. “We are unaware of any mayoral authority to unilaterally divert funds legislatively mandated and appropriate for a specific purpose to another purpose or, generally, to refuse to spend funds that the Council has specifically directed be spent.” Advocacy groups say the well-being of the 140,000 D.C. residents who rely on SNAP benefits hangs in the balance, particularly after the pandemic-era federal aid that previously enhanced benefits expired in March. In mid-December, they projected a   onto the Wilson Building, posting it with the hashtag #TheGrinchWhoStoleSnap. (Despite the funding dispute, residents receiving SNAP benefits should still expect to see their regular allotments next month.) The group D.C. Hunger Solutions, which has fought for the temporary benefit as well as a separate unfunded 2022 bill from council member Christina Henderson (I-At Large) that would create a local SNAP supplement to enhance families’ food assistance allotment, circulated a petition calling on Bowser (D) to use the excess revenue on SNAP as originally planned. In November, Henderson said Bowser’s administration had proposed funding administrative costs for Summer EBT, a federal program to provide food assistance to families with school-age children, instead of increasing SNAP, as a trade-off. The program would cost the city $2 million. Henderson said in a message Thursday that while D.C. had met the Jan. 1 deadline to submit a   to operate the Summer EBT program, she wasn’t sure how the human services department would administer that program considering its staffing challenges. Summer EBT requires residents to submit an application even if they already receive SNAP benefits, she said, in addition to other administrative steps. “Your administration has chronically underfunded public benefit enrollment and allotments, and now you claim that you can ignore the law and decline to implement the SNAP increase because of spending pressures that you have created and that are neither unforeseen nor new,” the D.C. Council wrote in a mid-December letter to Bowser. “We told District residents this money was coming because the law provided for it. Now, as we enter the holiday season, residents will learn that this sorely needed support is no longer on the horizon.” A spokesperson for Bowser did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Vikram Swaruup, executive director of Legal Aid DC, which provides pro bono legal services and assistance to low-income residents, said Thursday that his group had also sent a letter to Bowser in mid-December urging her to implement the temporary SNAP increase, and to also fully fund Henderson’s Give SNAP a Raise legislation in the fiscal 2025 budget. “Enhanced SNAP funding is critically important for our clients right now, with surging food costs, rent and other pressures to pay for basic necessities,” Swaruup said in an interview. “The council passed a law to ensure people could get a little bit more to provide for their families in these difficult times. To make sure that funding gets to the people who need it is morally imperative and legally required.” Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said in an interview that he was working to set up a meeting early next year between Bowser and relevant lawmakers, including Henderson, who chairs the health committee, to figure out a path forward. The DHS has said that it has upward of $75 million in spending pressures, Mendelson said, and that the agency further claims it doesn’t have the technical capability to issue the enhanced benefits next week even if funds weren’t a concern. “The council was very clear we wanted to see the SNAP benefits that had been increased during the pandemic continue, even if it requires local dollars. And it’s clear the law’s on our side in terms of appropriations the council made,” Mendelson said. “I’m hopeful we can get this resolved.” The meeting is tentatively scheduled for the second week of January, Mendelson said, though he declined to speculate on what a resolution might look like. “There have been a number of disagreements between the council and mayor over the past year, many of which      ,” he added. “It’d be nice to get this latest issue behind us and move toward more positive footing.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/28/dc-council-snap-benefits-bowser-attorney-general/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 18:40:00,

They would boost revenue by $720 million. The article has been corrected. RICHMOND — Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) proposed a state budget Wednesday that would cut income taxes but increase the sales tax, an approach his administration said would make state finances more resilient by shifting the revenue stream from what people earn to what they spend. The two-year plan features funding increases for mental health, child care, and pay for teachers and state employees — though the pay increases are smaller than in recent years.

Glenn Youngkin (R) proposed a state budget Wednesday that would cut income taxes but increase the sales tax, an approach his administration said would make state finances more resilient by shifting the revenue stream from what people earn to what they spend. The two-year plan features funding increases for mental health, child care, and pay for teachers and state employees — though the pay increases are smaller than in recent years. With Democrats set to take control of both chambers of the General Assembly when the legislative session begins Jan. 10, Youngkin will have to work across the aisle to get his priorities enacted. “Today I am proud to present our unleashing-opportunity budget as part of a bold, necessary path forward,” Youngkin said as he presented the spending plan to the legislature’s money committees Wednesday morning, calling for lawmakers to work together for the public good. Some Democrats, though, rejected the governor’s proposals as favoring the wealthy. Senate Democrats issued a statement calling the spending plan “absolutely disgraceful” and “a slap in the face of our most vulnerable individuals who call our Commonwealth home.” Youngkin  touted the ambitious project to build a Washington Capitals and Wizards arena in Northern Virginia as a major initiative for the state but said it would have little impact on the new budget, citing his promise that the state would pay no money upfront. Virginia would have to issue bonds for the $2.2 billion project, and a study commissioned by the state suggested that the public contribution could total $1.35 billion, though it would be offset by tax revenue generated by the arena and businesses around it. The budget also contains $500,000 to cover expenses for negotiating the arena deal. However, state and local officials also acknowledged last week that Virginia would make an upfront investment in the form of $150 million to $200 million in redirected transportation funds through an arrangement that has yet to be negotiated. Youngkin has said the money would have been needed for transportation in the area whether the arena was built or not. Several leading Democrats from other regions have expressed skepticism about the deal, but Youngkin told reporters after his presentation that he hoped lawmakers would see the benefits. “This is an extraordinary opportunity for Virginians — for Republicans and for Democrats, for all Virginians,” he said. “I don’t think this is a moment for us to inject partisan politics into something that is universally good for the commonwealth.” The governor acknowledged an urgent need to address transportation issues in the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria, where the arena would be built, but he told reporters that he is not ready to boost Virginia’s contribution to the Metro system until the transit authority operates more efficiently. This budget is Youngkin’s single biggest chance to put an imprint on state policy. Virginia adopts two-year spending plans staggered around gubernatorial elections; the first budget a new governor shepherds was created by the previous occupant of the Executive Mansion, and the last budget of an administration will be handled by the next governor. Only the midterm budget is a single governor’s from start to finish. In Youngkin’s case, he seems to have taken an approach that’s less confrontational than when he stormed into office on what he deemed a conservative mandate. “As we come together at our administration’s halftime … with what has been and will continue to be a divided government, we must compete even harder together,” Youngkin told the lawmakers. On the signature issue of tax cuts, Youngkin is proposing a 12 percent reduction in all income tax rates. The top bracket would drop to 5.1 percent from 5.75 percent — a decrease he tried but failed to get through a politically divided General Assembly this year. This time, though, Youngkin is also proposing to increase the earned-income tax credit to 25 percent of the federal allowance from 20 percent, a change that would benefit low-income working families. Democrats have long sought to raise that credit. The income tax cuts would cost the state about $1.1 billion in the first year and $2.3 billion in the second, according to the presentation. (Youngkin advisers who briefed reporters ahead of Wednesday’s presentation to the General Assembly had initially said the cost would be $3.4 billion in the second year, but that was actually the total two-year cost.) But that cost would be partially offset by a 0.9-percentage-point increase in the state sales tax, which is now 4.3 percent (plus an additional 1 percent levied by localities). For a governor who has tried to burnish his conservative bona fides and national political standing by trumpeting tax cuts, an increase seems out of character. State House Speaker-designee Don L. Scott Jr. (D-Portsmouth) drew loud laughter when he observed: “I heard the governor say this was halftime. Well he came back out as a Democrat — [with] a lot of tax increases.” But Youngkin pitched the package as “bold tax reform” that “allows Virginians to keep more of their hard-earned money” and stabilizes the state revenue stream. He also argued that shifting to a greater reliance on sales taxes would position Virginia to better compete with its neighbors to the south. Tennessee, for instance — a state often cited by Youngkin as a rival — has no state income tax but a higher sales tax, averaging 9.55 percent. The sales tax rate increase would be accompanied by an expansion of sales tax into digital areas that are not currently taxed in Virginia, such as streaming services and digital downloads. According to Youngkin’s presentation, the sales tax increases would boost state revenue by about $720 million in fiscal 2025 and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2026. Youngkin added that he has an additional priority not included in his budget proposal: eliminating the state’s personal-property tax on automobiles and replacing it with increased local taxing authority. Previous governors have tried and failed to get rid of the “car tax,” which is an important revenue stream for localities that otherwise have little ability to levy local taxes. But Youngkin vowed to try, urging lawmakers to work with him in bipartisan fashion. “It is complicated, yet it is a very worthy aspiration,” he said. Del. Luke E. Torian (D-Prince William), the incoming chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, issued a statement thanking Youngkin for laying out his vision and calling the proposal “a starting point” for coming up with a budget. But other Democrats reacted strongly against the idea of cutting income taxes for the wealthy while raising sales tax rates, which hit low-income people harder. “The Governor wants to raise taxes on working people so he can cut them for the wealthy. Thats not going to help Virginia. It isn’t going to help people pay the bills. It isn’t going to help our kids get a better education. And it isn’t going to help the working and middle class,” delegate and Sen.-elect Schuyler T. VanValkenburg (D-Henrico)  , the site formerly known as Twitter. At least some of Youngkin’s spending priorities are likely to draw bipartisan support. He wants to add $316 million over the two-year period for mental health services and more than $448 million a year for a program to ensure child care for some 27,000 children who are at risk of losing services as federal funds run out. Both areas have drawn Democratic support in the past. Youngkin’s pay proposals, though, are less generous than those Democrats have favored. He is calling for a 1 percent bonus for teachers and state employees in the first year of the budget, instead of a salary increase. For the second budget year, the governor seeks a 1 percent salary increase for state employees and a 2 percent “compensation supplement” for K-12 teachers in 2026, provided the local school division kicks in at least a 1 percent increase.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/20/virginia-youngkin-budget-taxes-proposal/,Washington Post,2023-12-20 18:16:00,
"NEW DELHI — A day after Apple warned independent Indian journalists and opposition party politicians in October that government hackers may have tried to break into their iPhones, officials under Prime Minister Narendra Modi promptly took action — against Apple. Officials from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) publicly questioned whether the Silicon Valley company’s internal threat algorithms were faulty and announced an investigation into the security of Apple devices. NEW DELHI — A day after Apple warned independent Indian journalists and opposition party politicians in October that government hackers may have tried to break into their iPhones, officials under Prime Minister Narendra Modi promptly took action — against Apple. Officials from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) publicly questioned whether the Silicon Valley company’s internal threat algorithms were faulty and announced an investigation into the security of Apple devices. In private, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, senior Modi administration officials called Apple’s India representatives to demand that the company help soften the political impact of the warnings. They also summoned an Apple security expert from outside the country to a meeting in New Delhi, where government representatives pressed the Apple official to come up with alternative explanations for the warnings to users, the people said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “They were really angry,” one of those people said. The visiting Apple official stood by the company’s warnings. But the intensity of the Indian government effort to discredit and strong-arm Apple disturbed executives at the company’s headquarters, in Cupertino, Calif., and illustrated how even Silicon Valley’s most powerful tech companies can face pressure from the increasingly assertive leadership of the world’s most populous country — and one of the most critical technology markets of the coming decade. Of the journalists who received notifications, two stood out: Anand Mangnale and Ravi Nair of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a nonprofit alliance of dozens of independent, investigative newsrooms from around the world. On Aug. 23, the OCCRP emailed Adani seeking comment for a story it would publish a week later alleging that his brother was part of a group that had secretly traded hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of the Adani Group conglomerate’s public stock, possibly in violation of Indian securities law. A forensic analysis of Mangnale’s phone, conducted by Amnesty International and shared with The Washington Post, found that within 24 hours of that inquiry, an attacker infiltrated the device and planted   that was developed by Israeli company NSO Group and that NSO says is sold only to governments. A spokeswoman for Adani denied that the magnate was involved in any hacking effort and accused OCCRP of conducting a “smear campaign” against the Adani Group. She also criticized The Post for asking whether the Adani Group was involved in, or had knowledge of, the hacking attempts against OCCRP. “While categorically denying and rejecting this insinuation, we find it disturbing and inappropriate that you would make an attempt to draw our name into this specious construct,” Varsha Chainani, the Adani Group’s head of corporate communications, said in an emailed response to written questions. “The Adani Group operates with the highest level of integrity and ethical standards.” Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a national spokesman for the BJP, said any evidence of hacking should be presented to the Indian government for investigation. Hiren Joshi, the top communications official in the prime minister’s office, did not respond to requests seeking comment. Apple declined to comment in response to written questions. The Modi government has never confirmed or denied using spyware, and it has refused to cooperate with a committee appointed by India’s Supreme Court to investigate whether it had. But two years ago, the Forbidden Stories journalism consortium, which included The Post and OCCRP,  that phones belonging to Indian journalists and political figures were infected with Pegasus, which grants attackers access to a device’s encrypted messages, camera and microphone. In recent weeks, The Post, in collaboration with Amnesty, found fresh cases of infections among Indian journalists. Additional work by The Post and New York security firm iVerify found that opposition politicians had been targeted, adding to the evidence suggesting the Indian government’s use of powerful surveillance tools. In addition, Amnesty showed The Post evidence it found in June that suggested a Pegasus customer was preparing to hack people in India. Amnesty asked that the evidence not be detailed to avoid teaching Pegasus users how to cover their tracks. “These findings show that spyware abuse continues unabated in India,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab. “Journalists, activists and opposition politicians in India can neither protect themselves against being targeted by highly invasive spyware nor expect meaningful accountability.” NSO spokesperson Liron Bruck said that the company does not know who is targeted by its customers but investigates complaints that are accompanied by details of the suspected hack. “While NSO cannot comment on specific customers, we stress again that all of them are vetted law enforcement and intelligence agencies that license our technologies for the sole purpose of fighting terror and major crime,” Bruck said. “The company’s policies and contracts provide mechanisms to avoid targeting of journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders or political dissidents that are not involved in terror or serious crimes.” David Kaye, a former United Nations special rapporteur on free expression who has testified before an Indian Supreme Court committee probing the government’s suspected use of Pegasus, said the recent reporting by The Post and its partners “further shifts the burden onto the Indian government to disprove the allegations that it uses these kinds of tools.” “Especially after this information, the government absolutely has to be honest and transparent,” Kaye said. ""But the accretion of evidence suggests this is not divorced from the broader assault by the Modi government on the freedom of expression and the right to protest.” One after another at October’s end, some of India’s best known journalists and politicians posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Apple had warned them that state-sponsored hackers may have targeted their devices. While Apple, as usual, did not accuse the Indian government or describe the attacks, the self-identified victims said there was a pattern: Many had questioned Modi’s close relationship with Adani, who   for his 2014 election campaign, traveled abroad with him during state visits and operates a vast portfolio of seaports, airports, railroads and  . On Aug. 31, the OCCRP published a joint investigation with British news outlets the Financial Times and the Guardian, reporting that Adani’s longtime associates had routed funds through offshore shell companies into publicly traded Adani shares. Adani denied the story’s allegations, but the report spurred calls for a parliamentary probe of suspected stock manipulation, and it renewed criticism that Modi’s government had failed to regulate Adani’s dealings out of loyalty to the businessman. Hours after OCCRP sought comment from Adani a week before the story’s publication, unknown hackers used an exploit called  to weave through two security holes in Mangnale’s phone and install Pegasus, according to Amnesty’s analysis. Amnesty said it found no signs of an attempted intrusion on Nair’s phone, which is not uncommon after sophisticated attacks. “We know Pegasus is only licensed to governments, and we know that the attack happened hours after we sent the email,” Mangnale said. “I am not pointing at anyone, but that is a hell of a coincidence.” Others warned by Apple include Mahua Moitra, a member of Parliament who has vocally condemned Modi’s relationship with Adani. Moitra   this month by a BJP-dominated committee investigating allegations that she accepted gifts from an Adani business rival in exchange for raising questions about the billionaire’s business interests.  In an interview, Moitra called the charges fabricated and said the government should scrutinize Adani’s transactions instead of her communications. “Adani is the government and the government is Adani,” Moitra said. “It is our greatest misfortune that we are governed by a bunch of peeping Toms.” IVerify examined Moitra’s phone backup and confirmed that she had received an Apple warning. It also saw urgent crash reports that, together with other digital records, suggested the device had been hacked. The company also found a threat notification and suspicious activity on the phone of Praveen Chakravarty, head of the opposition Indian National Congress party’s data analytics department. This is far from the first time the Indian government has been accused of snooping on critics. In 2018, researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab   that servers used to plant NSO spyware were embedded in Indian telecom networks. Two years later, Citizen Lab and Amnesty found that nine human rights advocates in India had been  with emails that installed commercial spyware on their Windows computers. In 2019, Meta’s WhatsApp also  NSO, alleging that the firm exploited vulnerabilities in its chat software to hack approximately 1,400 people,  the media that the victims included journalists and dissidents in India. NSO has denied wrongdoing in the case, which is pending. And last year, journalists working for OCCRP unearthed customs records showing that India’s Intelligence Bureau, the domestic security agency, received  of hardware matching Pegasus specifications from NSO’s offices outside Tel Aviv. Siddharth Varadarajan, a co-founder of the Indian digital media outlet the Wire, received one of Apple’s Oct. 30 warnings. Amnesty found that the same hackers that broke into Mangnale’s phone had tried to do the same to Varadarajan’s. In both cases, someone using the Apple ID natalymarinova@proton.me had used the Blastpass vulnerability. The Post received no response to an email sent to that address. The attempt to infiltrate Varadarajan’s phone and install Pegasus, which took place on Oct. 16, failed, Amnesty found. That’s because Blastpass had been revealed in September by Citizen Lab, Apple had fixed the two flaws it used and Varadarajan had kept his iPhone’s software updated. Varadarajan said he was not working on any sensitive stories around the time of the attempted hack. But he said he was leading protests over the arrest of a leftist publisher accused of spreading Chinese Communist Party propaganda. The publisher’s website, Newsclick, had often run articles critical of Modi and Adani. As soon as journalists and opposition politicians shared their warnings from Apple, BJP officials scrambled to contain the fallout. Senior Modi administration officials called Apple India’s managing director, Virat Bhatia, after the news broke, said two people with knowledge of the matter. One of the people said Indian officials asked Apple to withdraw the warnings and say it had made a mistake. After a heated discussion, the company’s India office said the most it could do was put out a public statement that emphasized certain caveats that Apple had already listed on its tech support  about the warnings. Still, Apple India’s corporate communications executives began privately asking Indian technology journalists to emphasize in their stories that Apple’s warnings could be false alarms and that similar warnings had been issued to users in 150 countries, not just India, said three Indian journalists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationship with Apple. The guidance effectively cast doubt on Apple’s own security team and shifted the spotlight away from the Modi government, these journalists said. A BJP memo distributed to party surrogates and friendly media outlets pushed similar talking points. The memo, seen by The Post, noted that Apple users in 150 countries, including “several political leaders in Uganda,” had received similar hacking notices and that Apple’s operating systems contained security vulnerabilities. The evening the memo went out, government officials anonymously told Indian outlets they suspected that an “algorithmic malfunction” within Apple’s internal systems had generated the hacking notices, and Piyush Goyal, India’s commerce minister, said in a television interview that the notices may have been “a prank.” On social media, pro-government influencers further muddied the waters. Sanjeev Sanyal, one of Modi’s economic advisers, pointed out on X that, in Apple’s hacking alerts, the company advised targeted users to consult with Access Now, a digital rights group that Sanyal noted has received funding from George Soros, the liberal financier and philanthropist. Soros is often painted by the Indian right as a boogeyman who masterminds international conspiracies against India. “See the sinister plot here?” Amit Malviya, the head of BJP’s social media team, asked his 765,000 followers on X, implying that Apple, Access Now, Soros and opposition politicians were working together to falsely accuse the government of hacking. On Oct. 31, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the deputy minister of electronics and information technology, announced that a government probe had been launched into “these threat notifications and ... Apples claims of being secure.” After receiving a barrage of questions from the government, one Apple security expert from outside India flew to the country in November and met with officials at the technology ministry’s New Delhi offices, where officials again demanded alternative explanations for the warnings, according to the three people familiar with the events. But Apple defended its work to the officials. “When Apple sends a notification, that’s yelling ‘fire.’ You’d better be pretty confident there’s a fire,” said a person who worked with the company. He and others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive dealings with authorities. In response to questions from The Post about whether the government exerted pressure on Apple, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said in a statement: “We have instituted technical investigation in the reported matter. So far, Apple has cooperated fully in the investigation process.” Nikhil Pahwa, the founder of the Indian tech policy news website MediaNama, said the Modi government deployed a familiar tactic. “You can’t have the Indian government investigating itself,” Pahwa said. “What we see often with the Indian government is what I would call ‘kite-flying’: putting a message out to defuse a situation or to misdirect a situation.” Silicon Valley companies have been pressured to overlook Indian government overreach before. This year, The Post  that both Facebook and X uncovered covert Indian military propaganda and calls for violence on their platforms, but executives hesitated to remove them. In both cases, executives at the companies’ India offices warned colleagues at the U.S. headquarters about the risks of clashing with the government and endangering their business. But the confrontation between Apple and the Modi administration this autumn was more delicate for both sides and ended in a stalemate, according to industry analysts and people working with Apple. For its part, Apple has been looking to India as a revenue driver as sales flatten in other markets. India is on track to account for 10 percent of Apple sales in 2025, up from 4 percent now, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. “India will be the heart and lungs of Apple’s strategy outside of China,” Ives said. The Modi administration, meanwhile, doesn’t want to alienate a high-profile device manufacturer that it has been courting as part of its “Make In India” campaign to create factory jobs. That may have helped to blunt the government’s retaliation over the hacking warnings, people working with Apple said. Although Apple India executives initially helped provide Modi government officials fodder for doubts about the warnings, Apple ultimately ceded less ground than its Silicon Valley peers have, according to people familiar with the events who noted that Apple issued no new statement after the November summit with Indian authorities. “Apple is treading a very delicate line,” said Steven Feldstein, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington who studies the spyware industry. “It needs to stand up for digital rights and its core brand of protecting privacy, but it also doesn’t want to jeopardize its presence in an extremely important market.” Rank-and-file Apple employees say that the company cannot afford to compromise on its commitment to making its devices as safe as possible in an era when crime and surveillance are surging. Last year, Apple introduced Lockdown Mode, an option that drastically reduces the number of electronic avenues that can be used to implant Pegasus or similar spyware. No infections have been discovered on phones running in Lockdown. A multitude of internal signals factor into Apple’s determination that a country is behind a specific hacking attempt, and the chances of false alarms are small, former employees and people working with the company say. Apple has expanded its security and threat-research teams in recent years, hiring technologists with human rights backgrounds as well as intelligence agency veterans, and it conducts inquiries like a small intelligence agency itself. If it detects something unusual, it looks for the same activity elsewhere and then follows the leads to find more hacking techniques and victims. With many hacking attempts, something outside the norm occurs. It can stand out as starkly as someone coming into a restaurant and ordering three desserts, then one entree, and then six appetizers, said a former Apple employee. Apple sued NSO for allegedly hacking its infrastructure and began warning of state-sponsored attacks in November 2021, after the Forbidden Stories consortium exposed worldwide abuses. (Attacks on Android phones are also common, but they have a variety of manufacturers.) The Commerce Department   NSO that same month, barring it from deals with American companies. The alerts have played a major role in exposing hacking activity, especially when those notified get their phones examined afterward. The discoveries have revealed hacking methods that can then be blocked, making it more expensive for those who sell the most powerful hacking tools, industry experts say. “Apple’s warnings have fundamentally changed the game for finding spyware abuses,” said John Scott-Railton, a researcher at Citizen Lab. “Their warnings shift the power balance.” The increased attention has elevated the issue to the White House, which this year  with allied governments not to buy from the companies whose tools were being abused by authoritarian regimes. India is not among the governments that joined the pledge. This year, there have been other signs of the Indian government hacking targets it perceives as threats. In recent weeks, iVerify examined the phone of the New York-based Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who U.S. prosecutors  was targeted for assassination by an Indian official. IVerify engineers found severe crashes of his encrypted messaging apps that could have been triggered by hacking attempts, said chief executive Danny Rogers. Referring to activity of an encrypted messaging app during two days in July, Rogers said: “Eight Signal crashes in a row screams that someone is trying to hack you.” Rogers said those crashes were not proof of a hacking attempt but were troubling because there was other evidence Pannun had been targeted. In May, Pannun was chatting over Telegram with an account belonging to Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist based in Canada, Pannun told The Post. When the conversation seemed off and Pannun called Nijjar over the phone, Nijjar said he hadn’t used Telegram in a while. A few weeks later, on June 18, Nijjar was shot by masked gunmen in a parking lot — a slaying that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in September was “credibly” linked to the Indian government. Pannun told The Post that his own phones had been hacked twice before. The U.S. State Department declined to address India’s alleged use of spyware directly. A spokesman said that the government “remains very concerned about the proliferation and misuse of commercial spyware, which is being used around the world to erode democratic values and to enable human rights abuses. We are committed to countering the misuse of this technology and the threats they pose, in partnership with allies around the world, and we welcome other like-minded partners to join us.” Officially, the Indian investigation of Apple continues, but people briefed on the matter said pressure on the company has waned. The next step is a report by India’s cybersecurity office, but it has no deadline. Indian media have reported that Indian officials now believe Apple’s warnings of state-sponsored hacking were genuine, but that the culprit may have been Beijing. While China is India’s great regional rival and a prodigious hacker, it has never been publicly linked to any use of Pegasus. The Israeli defense ministry must approve all sales of the spyware. While tensions between Apple and New Delhi have eased, the journalists who faced hacking attempts continue to experience pressure. In November and December, a third Indian journalist who has worked with OCCRP received phishing emails from a hacker who posed as a whistleblower seeking to leak corporate documents. The emails contained malware, according to OCCRP’s security team, which has not been able to identify the sender. After the publication of their Adani investigation in August, Mangnale and Nair were summoned by the crime branch of the Ahmedabad city police force, in Adani’s and Modi’s home state of Gujarat, to respond to a complaint by a local investor who accused them of releasing a “grossly false and malicious” story about Adani. Ahmedabad police have also summoned two British reporters with the Financial Times, which collaborated with OCCRP on the investigation, as part of a preliminary inquiry. A spokesperson for the FT declined to comment. The OCCRP said it has successfully appealed to the Indian Supreme Court to protect Mangnale and Nair from potential arrest, but the journalists are still fighting in court to avoid questioning by police. At their first hearing on Dec. 1, the OCCRP journalists discovered a particularly high-powered lawyer was arguing the case on behalf of local police. That lawyer was Tushar Mehta, the solicitor general of India.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/27/india-apple-iphone-hacking/,Washington Post,2023-12-27 19:00:00,

Check back later in the week for a possible player prop. Detroit should have plenty of motivation in this meeting of NFC contenders. The Lions can earn the conference’s No. 1 seed if they win their last two games and the San Francisco 49ers lose at least once. However, the Cowboys are clearly the better defensive team in this matchup, and that can’t be overlooked. Dallas   and Detroit ranks 14th, per analyst Aaron Schatz’s defense-adjusted value over average. The Cowboys’ defense is also saving 4.3 points per game based on the down, distance and field position of each play, ranking 10th, while the Lions rank just 22nd in expected points added on defense, per TruMedia. We also can’t skip over the Jekyll and Hyde nature of Dallas. The Cowboys are averaging a league-best 24.4-point margin of victory at home but have a negative differential on the road (minus-0.8, 14th). After back-to-back disappointing road losses, they’re back home this week. The league’s   (San Francisco) in 2023, per defense-adjusted value over average, is set to meet the league’s second-worst defense (Washington). The 49ers have faced a defense in the bottom third of the league (per DVOA) eight times and have averaged 32 points in those matchups while their opponents have averaged 20 points. That’s an average total of 52 points, with a median (middle value) of 50. The median point total in San Francisco’s games against teams outside the bottom third of defenses is just 39. Tight end Cole Kmet (knee) and wide receiver Darnell Mooney (concussion) did not practice on Thursday, perhaps leaving Moore as the only viable option for quarterback Justin Fields. Moore already leads the team with a 27 percent target share, nearly twice that of Mooney, who is second. Moore’s share rises to 33 percent when Mooney and Kmet are not on the field. Moore also sees more man coverage in these situations — and takes advantage of it. The percent of man coverage against him increases from 30 to 60 percent without Kmet and Mooney on the field, and his yards per target also improves from 12.5 to 19.3. In addition, Moore’s average depth of target also rises from 12.0 to 18.8 yards past the line of scrimmage when his two teammates are not on the field. Keep in mind these performances sans Kmet and Mooney are over a small sample size of 18 routes run this season, but it does suggest that Moore can take advantage of the situation on Sunday if Mooney and Kmet are unavailable to play. The plays above represent our best bets of the week because our analysis shows their value is the most lucrative compared with what we expect to happen on the field. Below, you will find against-the-spread picks for all of the games on this week’s schedule. However, trying to pick every game is something of a fool’s errand.

"A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Alexandria restaurant owner Bill Blackburn by a different name. The article has been updated. When Virginia officials and corporate executives formally announced their plans earlier this month to move the Washington Capitals and Wizards to a new arena in Alexandria, the audience watching them inside a heated tent cheered the deal with unwavering applause.

A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to Alexandria restaurant owner Bill Blackburn by a different name. The article has been updated. When Virginia officials and corporate executives formally announced their plans earlier this month to move the Washington Capitals and Wizards to a new arena in Alexandria, the audience watching them inside a heated tent cheered the deal with unwavering applause. But less than 12 hours after celebrating the news onstage, Alexandria Mayor Justin M. Wilson (D) found himself fielding a very different reaction: a volley of pointed questions from hundreds of constituents over what the project would mean for them. They wanted to know who would build the arena and where spectators would park. How it might impact the Northern Virginia city’s  and traffic on its already clogged roads. Why the deal, subject to a nonbinding agreement, was all becoming public now. Wilson answered nearly every question, at least in part, with the same response: “We will work on it.” The hour-long virtual meeting, much like a few sharp comments at a city council meeting a few days later on Dec. 16, points to the fierce debate that is rapidly emerging in Alexandria, where knock-down-drag-out civic fights are just as much a part of the city’s fabric as the colonial relics dotting its historic Old Town. The plan pushed by Wilson and Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), which would relocate the Capitals and Wizards to the Potomac Yard area from downtown D.C., comes at the start of a competitive election to   and fill all other seats on council. (Sitting lawmakers are nonetheless expected to vote on the arena proposal before any turnover in 2025.) If the   are enough to stir debate among civically engaged Alexandrians, then it’s no surprise that the arena has become the biggest bone of contention around for this city of 160,000, with next year’s primary as the backdrop. In little more than two weeks, the surge of scrutiny has touched nearly every hot-button local issue — from the city’s finances to labor practices and flooding. “I haven’t seen something this polarizing in the time I’ve been watching area politics,” said Katie Waynick, president of the Del Ray Citizens’ Association, who moderated her neighborhood group’s Dec. 13 meeting with Wilson. “There are some people that are really excited about it. There are some people that will not be okay with it no matter what is worked out. And there are a lot of people somewhere in the middle.” The tentative deal, which needs approval from the Virginia General Assembly before going to local lawmakers, would use the new sports arena as the anchor for a much larger 12-acre complex next to the Potomac Yard Metro station. The site would also include a separate concert hall co-owned by the city and an underground parking facility, as well as corporate offices and a media studio for Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the owner of the Capitals and Wizards. City officials behind the project have cast it as a way to catalyze development in the northern end of the Potomac Yard area, which is occupied by a shopping center and large parking lot but has long been viewed as underutilized. A Virginia Tech graduate campus is under construction just north of the planned complex. Preliminary development plans for Potomac Yard ARLINGTON CO. U.S.   ROUTE   1 ALEXANDRIA Potomac River G.W.

Yet the earliest critics — a handful of whom   at the Dec. 13 announcement with signs like “Moms Against Monumental” and “Houses, Not Hockey” — said those projections have only intensified their worries about too much coming to the neighborhood, too quickly. “The very nature of the project doesn’t serve the community well,” said Andrew Macdonald, a former city council member who has been organizing a group to oppose the arena. “We want a development that fits into the fabric of the city and protects and preserves our quality of life. This most definitely does not do that.” Macdonald, whose council tenure in the 2000s includes a stint as vice mayor, said his Stop the Arena at Potomac Yard group will be lobbying both city and state officials on a long list of objections. As a geologist, he primarily opposes the arena on environmental grounds. But he also takes issue with the financing plan. Under the deal, a sports and entertainment authority created by Virginia lawmakers would issue two bonds to finance the construction of the arena and surrounding complex. Monumental would put in about $400 million up front and make lease payments on the arena, which would pay off one bond. The city and state   for hundreds of millions of dollars if the expected tax revenue does not materialize for the other bond of about $1.05 billion, according to a state-requested JPMorgan analysis of the tentative deal, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. “It’s a project that’s really based on subsidizing a billionaire’s desire to build a sports facility,” Macdonald said. (Monumental’s managing partner, Ted Leonsis, has a Forbes-estimated net worth of $2.8 billion.) City leaders have emphasized that the arena and surrounding development included in the deal will more than break even, though the analysis released by Landrum’s office did not detail specific numbers on the tax revenue it would generate for Alexandria. For every dollar being borrowed to build the stadium and which would need to be paid back, they say, it would generate at least another dollar to increase city services. “The asset will generate revenue every year, and we will pocket that. The asset will pay off our investment,” Landrum said. The city would separately put in $106 million contribution to build the parking facility and the concert hall, she acknowledged, but revenue on tickets would eventually make up that cost, too. Bill Blackburn, who owns several restaurants around the city, said he sees promise in the proposed arena — for his businesses, which include Pork Barrel BBQ in the more suburban Del Ray neighborhood nearby — and for the family he is raising in the same neighborhood. “There certainly are challenges, but they’re solvable,” the 46-year-old said. “As the shock wears off, reasonable people are going to say: ‘Hey, this isn’t that bad. This is an exciting opportunity.’” Blackburn, who has donated to Wilson’s previous campaigns, said that he would be eager to walk to hockey games — or for his kids, now 5 and 9, to walk to their first concerts when they are older. Mostly, though, he sees it in terms of tax revenue: The city depends on real estate taxes, particularly on houses and apartments, to fund the bulk of its city services. To build new schools and parks or bolster roads and police, it would need to either raise property taxes or try to encourage new efforts like this one. “Alexandria has an appetite for pretty shiny things, and that stuff has to be paid for,” he added. After Landrum and city manager Jim Parajon presented details on the plan during a city council meeting earlier this month, a line of residents getting up to the mic raised other concerns — an early preview, perhaps, of how lawmakers will have to negotiate between a growing list of constituent concerns. Dan Heng, a Potomac Yard resident who said he previously lived near Capital One Arena, questioned what kind of Metro access the arena might have given the transportation system’s . He also asked how the city would pay for the additional police presence required on game days. “You might know the answer to some of these questions, but we don’t,” he said. “I’m a sports fan. I love sports. There are no worse neighbors than Capitals and Wizards fans leaving a game.” Nathaly Zelaya, an organizer for the advocacy group Tenants and Workers United, called on the council to commission an independent analysis of the arena’s impact on people of color and low-income renters, including in the Arlandria-Chirilagua neighborhood where her organization is based. Group leaders say the area’s working-class Central American immigrants have seen steep rent increases amid the build out of Amazon’s new headquarters nearby. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post and the newspaper’s interim chief executive, Patty Stonesifer, sits on the company’s board.) The Amazon campus is a few miles away from their neighborhood. Tenants and Workers leaders, who reiterated Zelaya’s request to council members in a Dec. 18 letter, noted that the proposed arena is practically across the street. “We hope the leadership of Alexandria City takes a bold stance to protect and preserve our families and prioritize working class people of color who will be the most impacted,” the letter read, “compared to traffic, parking and aesthetic concerns.” Macdonald, meanwhile, said he is hoping that history will repeat itself. After the owner of the Washington football team hatched a similar deal in the 1990s to move a football stadium to Potomac Yard, the plan fell apart in negotiations between the team and the governor. Alexandria’s then-mayor, Patsy Ticer, emerged as one of the loudest voices in a fervent local opposition campaign. Wilson, though, has expressed optimism about the arena and complex. He said at this month’s Del Ray meeting that he wanted to hear from residents on what would “get them to yes” — what kinds of conditions would be necessary for them to ultimately support the project. Macdonald said he didn’t have much of answer. “It’s hard to see how you could ever make this project palatable,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/28/alexandria-capitals-wizards-arena-virginia-monumental/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 06:00:00,

The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft on Wednesday over the tech companies’ use of its copyrighted articles to train their artificial intelligence technology, joining a growing wave of opposition to the tech industry’s using creative work without paying for it or getting permission. OpenAI and Microsoft used “millions” of Times articles to help build their tech, which is now extremely lucrative and directly competes with the Times’s own services, the newspaper’s lawyers wrote in a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan. “For months, The Times has attempted to reach a negotiated agreement,” the Times’s lawyers said in the  . “ … These negotiations have not led to a resolution.” OpenAI said it respects the rights of content creators and owners, and is committed to working with them “to ensure they benefit from AI technology and new revenue models,” spokesperson Lindsey Held said. “Our ongoing conversations with the New York Times have been productive and moving forward constructively, so we are surprised and disappointed with this development.” Microsoft spokespeople did not return a request for comment. The “ ” (LLMs) behind AI tools such as ChatGPT work by ingesting huge amounts of text scraped from the internet, learning the connections between words and concepts, then developing the ability to predict what word to say next in a sentence, allowing them to mimic human speech and writing. OpenAI, Microsoft and Google have refused to reveal what goes into their newest models, but previous LLMs have been shown to include large amounts of content from news organizations and catalogues of books. The tech companies have steadfastly said that the use of information scraped from the internet to train their AI algorithms falls under “fair use” — a concept in copyright law that allows people to use the work of others if it is substantially changed. The Times’s lawsuit, however, includes multiple examples of OpenAI’s GPT-4 AI model outputting New York Times articles word for word. Legal experts have said that plaintiffs will have stronger cases of copyright infringement if they can show that AI tools are directly reproducing copyrighted works, rather than paraphrasing the information from them. The news industry has been grappling with its relationship to this rapidly evolving technology. Several media companies have started internal conversations on how to use emerging automated tools to assist with newsgathering and production. And some, such as Sports Illustrated, have   for using AI to generate news articles that were passed off as being written by humans. Other online publishing companies have already begun using AI to churn out huge amounts of new content with a goal of winning Google search traffic to gin up ad revenue. These include fake news sites that publish false information. Since May, the number of websites showing fake AI-written articles has jumped by more than 1,000 percent, according to  , an organization that tracks misinformation. But the use of this technology also presents a possible existential crisis for the news industry, which has struggled to find ways to replace the revenue it once generated from its profitable print products. The number of journalists working in newsrooms declined by more than 25 percent between 2008 and 2020, according to the Pew Research Center.

And since August, at least 583 news organizations, including the Times, The Washington Post and Reuters, have   on their websites to prevent tech companies from scraping their articles.

Moore, who was hospitalized overnight, is now home and is in concussion protocol, according to Browns Coach Kevin Stefanski. “Elijah Moore spent the night in the hospital. He is home now,” Stefanski   Friday. “He is in concussion protocol, so we’ll just work through that over the next few days with him, but glad that he’s back home.” Cleveland Browns wide receiver Elijah Moore has been released from a hospital following a scary head injury he suffered Thursday night during Cleveland’s 37-20 win over the New York Jets. Moore, who was hospitalized overnight, is now home and is in concussion protocol, according to Browns Coach Kevin Stefanski. “Elijah Moore spent the night in the hospital. He is home now,” Stefanski   Friday. “He is in concussion protocol, so we’ll just work through that over the next few days with him, but glad that he’s back home.” Moore suffered the injury near the end of the second quarter when he was tackled by Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley and his head hit the grass. Shortly after the impact, the 23-year-old receiver began convulsing on the ground before trainers ran onto the field. He was later helped to the injury tent, then the locker room. Unfortunately those are involuntary  movements from a Brain Injury for Elijah Moore  A third-year receiver out of Mississippi, Moore played his first two seasons with the Jets before being traded to the Browns earlier this year. He has 59 receptions for 640 yards this season, and caught his second touchdown of the year earlier in the second quarter Thursday, before his injury. Moore’s contributions helped the Browns  . The win guarantees the Browns (11-5) at least a wild-card spot, with the chance to win the AFC North and even the conference’s top overall seed with some help. Such a possibility seemed unlikely weeks ago, when the Browns announced on Nov. 15 that quarterback Deshaun Watson would undergo season-ending shoulder surgery. Watson at the time was the latest injury casualty for a team that has 12 players on injured reserve, including star running back Nick Chubb. The Browns are also playing without both first-team offensive tackles. Joe Flacco, the 38-year-old quarterback who was the MVP of Super Bowl XLVII as a Baltimore Raven, is Cleveland’s fourth starting quarterback this season. But he’s led a resurgent Browns team that has now won four of five games since he took the reins at the start of this month.

The pictures are horrifying:  ,  , Hillary Clinton and Pope Francis with their necks sliced open. There are Sikh, Navajo and other people from ethnic-minority groups with internal organs spilling out of flayed skin. The images look realistic enough to mislead or upset people. But they’re all fakes generated with artificial intelligence that Microsoft says is safe — and has built right into your computer software. What’s just as disturbing as the decapitations is that Microsoft doesn’t act very concerned about stopping its AI from making them. Lately, ordinary users of technology such as Windows and Google have been inundated with AI. We’re wowed by what the new tech can do, but we also keep learning that it can , including by carrying on wildly inappropriate  and making similarly inappropriate . For AI actually to be safe enough for products used by families, we need its makers to take responsibility by anticipating how it might go awry and investing to fix it quickly when it does. In the case of these awful AI images, Microsoft appears to lay much of the blame on the users who make them. My specific concern is with Image Creator, part of   and recently added to the iconic  . This AI turns text into images, using technology called DALL-E 3 from Microsoft’s partner OpenAI. Two months ago, a user experimenting with it showed me that prompts worded in a particular way caused the AI to make pictures of violence against women, minorities, politicians and celebrities. “As with any new technology, some are trying to use it in ways that were not intended,” Microsoft spokesman Donny Turnbaugh said in an emailed statement. “We are investigating these reports and are taking action in accordance with our content policy, which prohibits the creation of harmful content, and will continue to update our safety systems.” That was a month ago, after I approached Microsoft as a journalist. For weeks earlier, the whistleblower and I had tried to alert Microsoft through user-feedback forms and were ignored. As of the publication of this column, Microsoft’s AI still makes pictures of mangled heads. This is unsafe for many reasons, including that a   is less than a year away and Microsoft’s AI makes it easy to create “deepfake” images of politicians, with and without mortal wounds. There’s already   on social networks including X, formerly Twitter, and 4chan, that extremists are using Image Creator to spread explicitly racist and antisemitic memes. Perhaps, too, you don’t want AI capable of picturing decapitations anywhere close to a Windows PC used by your kids. Accountability is especially important for Microsoft, which is one of the most powerful companies shaping the future of AI. It has a multibillion-dollar investment in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — itself in turmoil over how to keep AI safe. Microsoft has moved faster than any other Big Tech company to put generative AI into its popular apps. And its whole sales pitch to users and lawmakers alike is that it is the  . Microsoft, which declined my requests to interview an executive in charge of AI safety, has more resources to identify risks and correct problems than almost any other company. But my experience shows the company’s safety systems, at least in this glaring example, failed time and again. My fear is that’s because Microsoft doesn’t really think it’s their problem. I learned about Microsoft’s decapitation problem from Josh McDuffie. The 30-year-old Canadian is part of an online community that makes AI pictures that sometimes veer into very bad taste. “I would consider myself a multimodal artist critical of societal standards,” he tells me. Even if it’s hard to understand why McDuffie makes some of these images, his provocation serves a purpose: shining light on the dark side of AI. In early October, McDuffie and his friends’ attention focused on AI from Microsoft, which had just released an updated Image Creator for Bing with OpenAI’s latest tech. Microsoft   that it has “controls in place to prevent the generation of harmful images.” But McDuffie soon figured out they had major holes. Broadly speaking, Microsoft has two ways to prevent its AI from making harmful images: input and output. The input is how the AI gets trained with data from the internet, which teaches it how to transform words into relevant images. Microsoft doesn’t disclose much about the training that went into its AI and what sort of violent images it contained. Companies also can try to create guardrails that stop Microsoft’s AI products from generating certain kinds of output. That requires hiring professionals, sometimes called  , to proactively probe the AI for where it might produce harmful images. Even after that, companies need humans to play whack-a-mole as users such as McDuffie push boundaries and expose more problems. That’s exactly what McDuffie was up to in October when he asked the AI to depict extreme violence, including mass shootings and beheadings. After some experimentation, he discovered a prompt that worked and nicknamed it the “kill prompt.” The prompt — which I’m intentionally not sharing here — doesn’t involve special computer code. It’s cleverly written English. For example, instead of writing that the bodies in the images should be “bloody,” he wrote that they should contain red corn syrup, commonly used in movies to look like blood. McDuffie kept pushing by seeing if a version of his prompt would make violent images targeting specific groups, including women and ethnic minorities. It did. Then he discovered it also would make such images featuring celebrities and politicians. That’s when McDuffie decided his experiments had gone too far. Three days earlier, Microsoft had launched an “ ,” offering people   “to discover vulnerabilities in the new, innovative, AI-powered Bing experience.” So McDuffie uploaded his own “kill prompt” — essentially, turning himself in for potential financial compensation. After two days, Microsoft sent him an email saying his submission had been rejected. “Although your report included some good information, it does not meet Microsoft’s requirement as a security vulnerability for servicing,” says the email. Unsure whether circumventing harmful-image guardrails counted as a “security vulnerability,” McDuffie submitted his prompt again, using different words to describe the problem. That got rejected, too. “I already had a pretty critical view of corporations, especially in the tech world, but this whole experience was pretty demoralizing,” he says. Frustrated, McDuffie shared his experience with me. I submitted his “kill prompt” to the AI bounty myself, and got the same rejection email. In case the AI bounty wasn’t the right destination, I also filed McDuffie’s discovery to Microsoft’s “ ” site, which has a specific form to report “problematic content” from Image Creator. I waited a week and didn’t hear back. Meanwhile, the AI kept picturing decapitations, and McDuffie showed me that images appearing to exploit similar weaknesses in Microsoft’s safety guardrails were showing up on social media. I’d seen enough. I called Microsoft’s chief communications officer and told him about the problem. “In this instance there is more we could have done,” Microsoft emailed in a statement from Turnbaugh on Nov. 27. “Our teams are reviewing our internal process and making improvements to our systems to better address customer feedback and help prevent the creation of harmful content in the future.” I pressed Microsoft about how McDuffie’s prompt got around its guardrails. “The prompt to create a violent image used very specific language to bypass our system,” the company said in a Dec. 5 email. “We have large teams working to address these and similar issues and have made improvements to the safety mechanisms that prevent these prompts from working and will catch similar types of prompts moving forward.” But are they? McDuffie’s precise original prompt no longer works, but after he changed around a few words, Image Generator still makes images of people with injuries to their necks and faces. Sometimes the AI responds with the message “Unsafe content detected,” but not always. The images it produces are less bloody now — Microsoft appears to have cottoned on to the red corn syrup — but they’re still awful. Microsoft’s repeated failures to act are a red flag. At minimum, it indicates that building AI guardrails isn’t a very high priority, despite the company’s public commitments to creating  . I tried McDuffie’s “kill prompt” on a half-dozen of Microsoft’s AI competitors, including tiny start-ups. All but one simply refused to generate pictures based on it. What’s worse is that even DALL-E 3 from OpenAI — the company Microsoft partly owns — blocks McDuffie’s prompt. Why would Microsoft not at least use technical guardrails from its own partner? Microsoft didn’t say. But something Microsoft did say, twice, in its statements to me caught my attention: people are trying to use its AI “in ways that were not intended.” On some level, the company thinks the problem is McDuffie for using its tech in a bad way. In the legalese of the company’s AI  , Microsoft’s lawyers make it clear the buck stops with users: “Do not attempt to create or share content that could be used to harass, bully, abuse, threaten, or intimidate other individuals, or otherwise cause harm to individuals, organizations, or society.” I’ve heard others in Silicon Valley make a version of this argument. Why should we blame Microsoft’s Image Creator any more than Adobe’s Photoshop, which bad people have been using for decades to make all kinds of terrible images? But AI programs are different from Photoshop. For one, Photoshop hasn’t come with an instant “behead the pope” button. “The ease and volume of content that AI can produce makes it much more problematic. It has a higher potential to be used by bad actors,” says McDuffie. “These companies are putting out potentially dangerous technology and are looking to shift the blame to the user.” The bad-users argument also gives me flashbacks to Facebook in the mid-2010s, when the “move fast and break things” social network acted like it couldn’t possibly be responsible for stopping people from weaponizing its tech to spread misinformation and hate. That stance led to Facebook’s fumbling to put out one fire after another, with real harm to society. “Fundamentally, I don’t think this is a technology problem; I think it’s a capitalism problem,” says  , a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. “They’re all looking at this latest wave of AI and thinking, ‘We can’t miss the boat here.’” He adds: “The era of ‘move fast and break things’ was always stupid, and now more so than ever.” Profiting from the latest craze while blaming bad people for misusing your tech is just a way of shirking responsibility.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/28/microsoft-ai-bing-image-creator/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 06:00:00,
"WYTHE COUNTY, Va. — The federal government spent $123 million during the   pandemic to build a massive chemical plant here in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a project meant to help ensure that supply-chain disruptions would never again leave the nation short of medical gloves. WYTHE COUNTY, Va. — The federal government spent $123 million during the   pandemic to build a massive chemical plant here in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a project meant to help ensure that supply-chain disruptions would never again leave the nation short of medical gloves. In late spring, construction wrapped up on the plant, the only one in the country capable of producing the synthetic rubber needed to make disposable nitrile gloves. By fall, the factory was mothballed. “Just wasted money,” Blue Star NBR chief executive Scott Maier said this month, surveying hundreds of motors removed from the plant’s reactors in November and stashed in a humidity-controlled storage shed, where they will stay unless and until production gets underway. “This was all built, ready to go. And because we didn’t start, now we have to take it all apart. … We just want to finish what we started.” Washington initially planned to build two factories with Blue Star, one to make the rubber and another to turn the material into medical gloves, which were in dangerously short supply in the early days of the pandemic. But by the time the rubber plant was erected, the worst of the pandemic and glove shortages had passed. Now, federal officials say, Blue Star’s contract is complete even though it still needs $60 million to hook up the rubber factory to utilities and $170 million to build an adjacent glove factory. The company will have to win a new contract or find private funding to move forward. State and local officials have urged Washington to complete a project that promised to bolster the nation’s glove supply and deliver more than 2,400 sorely needed jobs to Virginia’s rural Southwest. So far the project has managed only to plunk a seeming white elephant on the region’s premier industrial plot. “How a company could act in good faith and build this plant and not have follow-through from those that initiated it, it truly makes my brain hurt,” said David Manley, executive director of the Joint Industrial Development Authority of Wythe County. Launched in late 2020 when   was in the White House and the coronavirus was raging, the Blue Star plant and a glove factory planned for next door seemed to get lost in the change of administrations and the nation’s shifting priorities. Lots of cooks from an alphabet soup of federal entities — DOD, HHS, ASPR, IBMSC and DFC — had a hand in the project, some of them moving on after making what Blue Star says were verbal guarantees to cover cost overruns on the nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) plant and to build the glove factory. The United States makes very little of the personal protective equipment (PPE) that the health industry uses in abundance, including gloves. As demand for PPE soared in the early days of the pandemic, trade disruptions meant health-care providers often  . That prompted federal officials to try to stimulate domestic production. In late 2020, federal officials encouraged Blue Star to add an NBR plant to the stand-alone glove factory it initially proposed. At the time, other companies had sought contracts to produce gloves, but none pitched making the rubber. Without a domestic source for that material, any new glove makers couldn’t operate if supplies weren’t flowing from overseas. Blue Star agreed to build both, anticipating efficiencies from a vertically integrated operation that would start with raw materials and churn out finished gloves. The company sought separate contracts for the NBR plant and glove factory, acting at the direction of federal officials hurriedly cobbling together emergency funding and contracting across multiple arms of the bureaucracy. At the government’s urging, Blue Star later tripled the size of the NBR plant so it could supply other glove factories as well as its own. That much is not in dispute. What went wrong after that is not entirely clear, but funding came through only for the NBR plant. That meant certain costs the twin operations were supposed to share, including site development and systems to treat and recycle water, fell entirely on the rubber plant. It didn’t help that Blue Star built during a period of steep inflation, with soaring costs of steel and construction supplies pushing the project over budget. Blue Star said all of those funding issues left the company without money for utility hookups after the Defense Department, which handled contracting for the Department of Health and Human Services during the emergency, declared in May that Blue Star had successfully completed its contract. Even if the plant got connected to utilities, Blue Star said, it would have no market for the rubber without its own glove factory because few, if any, of the glove factories that Washington paid to set up during the pandemic are up and running. Despite substantial pandemic-era investments in glove plants around the country, only about 2 percent of the 120 billion to 150 billion medical gloves used in the United States every year are made domestically. Almost all of the imports come from Asia. Asked this month about Blue Star’s situation, the Defense Department did not respond to a request for comment. HHS, which says work continues on several glove factories, released a written statement saying that its investments have “significantly expanded” the country’s ability to produce PPE — including the “capacity” to produce more than 1.6 billion gloves. But by “capacity,” HHS means the “domestic manufacturing infrastructure” to produce the items, not production itself, which is overseen by the private companies that built the PPE factories, not HHS. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to preparing for future public health threats by continuing to invest in domestic manufacturing and the Strategic National Stockpile,” the HHS statement said. “Per the terms of the contract awarded, Blue Star has fulfilled all contractually obligated deliverables. HHS continues to work closely with Blue Star and other companies interested in domestic manufacturing to ensure a more resilient public health supply chain.” Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR), an agency within HHS, addressed gear production more expansively in November while writing on an official HHS blog. “It took over 50 years for these industries to leave our shores and it will take robust investments and time to bring these manufacturing capabilities back,” she wrote. “However, the office is currently only funded with limited supplemental appropriations. We are pleased there are funds included in the Senate draft Fiscal Year 2024 budget and hope to see Congress invest in this work.” Blue Star sits inside Progress Park, a 1,200-acre industrial site that local leaders carved out of rolling farmland in 1999. It occupies Lot 24, 233 acres with prime access to major gas, electric and water lines. Rail runs right up to the property line, not far from two major interstates. The county’s industrial development authority granted the parcel, worth about $17.5 million, to Blue Star. “Definitely one of the best sites in the western half of the state,” is how Manley described the lot. “It was begging for a major project.” The Blue Star plant stands out from the beige, flat-topped structures that otherwise occupy the park. Soaring 85 feet tall, with a dark, corrugated exterior and peaked rooflines, it gives off a modern-farmhouse vibe, with a cluster of water tanks standing in for grain silos. With the Blue Ridge as its backdrop and round hay bales all around, the place could pass for a wedding venue. Inside stands a succession of giant steel vats, ready to turn more than a dozen petroleum-based chemicals into the main ingredient for the throwaway gloves that keep American health-care workers safe. The chemicals, including butadiene and acrylonitrile, would be combined, slowly churned, cooled and finally stripped of elements unneeded in the finished NBR. Along the way, the rubber would get pumped to the ceiling — six stories high — then flow back down via an innovative gravity-fed system meant to save energy and reduce bubbles that could cause flaws in gloves. From there, the finished NBR would be piped to an adjacent glove factory or shipped somewhere else. It took three years to assemble the NBR factory, with the Defense Department declaring the contract completed in May, despite the lack of utility hookups. Six months later, with winter weather approaching but no production on the horizon, Blue Star brought in a team of mechanical and electrical contractors to remove scores of motors. Leaving the motors in place but idle — subjected to cold, moisture and a residual electrical charge — could have caused damage, explained Maier, the Blue Star CEO, who has a background in private equity and manufacturing and does not have other NBR or glove operations. “You can’t leave a car unattended in a garage for a couple years and then expect it to start up right away,” Maier said, standing inside a climate-controlled storage building next door to the plant, where the blue, orange and green motors sat on wooden pallets spread across the floor. “There’s kind of preventative maintenance you need to do if you want it to run.” And Blue Star most certainly wants it to run. “It would be a shame not to finish,” Victor Galati, Blue Star’s chief financial officer, said outside the building, where he showed off a vial of NBR produced in a lab set up in a construction trailer on the site to prove to the government that their concept works. “It’s a vital product that we need, and we’re putting our country at risk, not having something so important.” The project’s importance to the region was significant, too, though Wythe County is better off than other parts of Southwest Virginia that are heavily dependent on coal. Progress Park hums with advanced manufacturing for major automotive brands and enough Gatorade production to quench thirsts across the East Coast. But the park has plenty of undeveloped lots that for now serve only as pasture for Black Angus cattle. In the nearby town of Wytheville, the historic downtown has experienced a renaissance in recent years, with handsome brick storefronts boasting two brewpubs, a wine bar and the town’s first Vietnamese bakery. Tending the counter at P.R. Sturgill Fine Jewelry on Wytheville’s Main Street, Mary Wright said hopes have faded that the factory would jump-start housing development and benefit local retailers. “I had a friend that was doing grading work [for Blue Star],” she said. “… And all of a sudden they said, you know, ‘Shut down, because we’re out of money. And the government, they’ll be sending us some money. As soon as [we] get it, you’ll come back to work.’ He don’t have a job now.” Beth Lowder, 65, while shopping for a Christmas present for her grandson, said the plant “would be a gift to the area.” But she had lost hope, too. “We’ve had promises of [other] things coming about, and then for whatever reason, it got shut down,” she said. Having lunch nearby at Petals Wine Bar was Angeline Lloyd, a 47-year-old local artist who’d always had mixed feelings about the project because it cost her family 20 acres of farmland; the state Department of Transportation seized it by eminent domain to build a spur from the plant nearby Interstate 77. “I want the area to prosper. I want people to have good jobs,” she said. “But it tugs at me a little, too, because our family’s been out there since the 1930s.” At Chau’s Corner Bakery, owner Hoa Chau hoped Blue Star would create jobs and housing for the next generation, including her 9-year-old son. “I love this place,” said Chau, who came to Wytheville nearly 10 years ago from Houston, following her husband, an engineer who had a job at Hitachi Energy, which makes power transformers in nearby Bland. Five years ago, she opened the bakery just off Wytheville’s Main Street, serving pho and spring rolls as well as freshly baked desserts. The bakery has gained a loyal following, but Chau worries that the area’s population will continue “bleeding” unless new industries spring up for the next generation. “They grow up, they go away, they study, but they cannot come back because there’s no job for them,” she said. “If we had that, we’d have something, at least some way, to come back and stay and help this community prosper.” Despite pleas from the state’s congressional delegation to senior Biden administration officials, no solution is in sight. Indeed, HHS made clear last month that it’s not counting on a single drop of milky-white NBR coming out of Blue Star. Production projections that O’Connell made on the HHS blog in November referenced only the NBR expected to flow in two years from a yet-to-be-built plant in Louisiana, which won funding in September. Virginia Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, and Rep. H. Morgan Griffith (R) have tried to help Blue Star by going straight to the top of the two departments chiefly involved, writing to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Blue Star believes it has done everything asked of it — raised their hand to help during the COVID-19 pandemic, submitted proposals as directed by federal government officials, sought and received state and local support, and continues to talk to all agencies involved in this important work of expanding the industrial base for public health and national security,” they wrote early this year. The lawmakers called the situation “urgent” and asked HHS and the Pentagon to work “expeditiously” with Blue Star to “ensure this critical project that will help secure the domestic PPE supply chain is finalized.” But there is no indication that funding is heading Blue Star’s way, even as HHS bankrolls the entirely new NBR plant in Louisiana with another company, SafeSource. An HHS spokesperson said the $144 million SafeSource contract had been in the pipeline for some time and originally was intended to compliment Blue Star’s operation, not replace it. But when outlining the future of domestic PPE production in her HHS blog post in November, O’Connell referenced only the NBR production expected from SafeSource — two years down the road. “With our investments, the U.S. will have the capacity to produce … 90,000 metric tons of nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), enough raw material to produce an additional 840 million nitrile gloves per year by September 2025,” she wrote, using the anticipated output and start date for SafeSource. O’Connell wrote back to the lawmakers on behalf of HHS on May 23, saying that the department remained “grateful that companies like Blue Star were willing to take on new projects during COVID-19” but that Blue Star’s contract was days away from ending — meaning no new money for utilities or the glove factory would be on the way, at least under that agreement. “This is devastating news for both Blue Star and the surrounding communities of Wythe County and the greater Southwest Virginia region,” Jason El Koubi, president of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, wrote to Warner, Kaine and Griffith in August. “Without the federal funding, Blue Star does not have a path forward.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/28/southwest-virginia-blue-star-plant-glove-rubber-factory/,Washington Post,2023-12-28 16:34:00,
"The past 12 months of sports delivered both triumph and unrest: a women’s World Cup with a jarring aftermath; golf riven by competing circuits and a controversial proposed alliance; a collegiate sports system undergoing upheaval; an international baseball star receiving a record deal. Rather than ranking the biggest moments of 2023, we asked our staff to project the biggest questions that will shape the world of sports in the coming 12 months. The past 12 months of sports delivered both triumph and unrest: a women’s World Cup with a jarring aftermath; golf riven by competing circuits and a controversial proposed alliance; a collegiate sports system undergoing upheaval; an international baseball star receiving a record deal. Rather than ranking the biggest moments of 2023, we asked our staff to project the biggest questions that will shape the world of sports in the coming 12 months. At this time last year, the biggest question facing MLB was whether the sport could adapt to a fast-moving future and recover fans lost to years of slow-moving games. It did that by   in 2023, and while the sample remains small, even the stauncher traditionalists in the sport admit the rule   and broadened its appeal. Now, with the game moving like it should, with a baseball player receiving   in professional sports history this winter, baseball is back on a promising trajectory. The only problem: that player (Shohei Ohtani), like so many other elite pitchers,   when his team needed him most last season. During the 2023 calendar year alone, 30 pitchers who did or likely would have pitched in the majors underwent Tommy John surgery. Dozens more lost months, or even the entire season, to shoulder issues. According to  , just less than 35 percent of those who pitched in MLB last year had undergone Tommy John surgery — the highest percentage since he began compiling data in 2016. Almost every playoff team was without a key pitcher because of elbow surgery: The Orioles were without closer  , the Marlins without ace Sandy Alcántara, the Dodgers without Walker Buehler, Tony Gonsolin and Dustin May. The eventual World Series champion Texas Rangers were without projected ace  and survived that loss only because they had the money to spend on reinforcements. As leaguewide velocity increases and pitchers use max-effort deliveries to keep up, injuries follow. Some pitchers posited that the pitch clock, which forced them to work more quickly and rest less between pitches, contributed to a more acute spike in 2023. Teams that build around starting pitching cannot be assured they will have it all season and must almost expect that any long-term deal will include a year-plus absence because of Tommy John or something like it. The data says pitcher injuries are firmly on the rise, but the sport is better with its best pitchers on the field.  The state of men’s hoops in America is cause for growing consternation: The past five NBA MVP winners were born outside the United States,   in September, and European stars Luka Doncic and   into the 2030s. Meanwhile, NCAA basketball finds itself in a radical transition period thanks to NIL (name, image and likeness), and only one of the top five   last June bothered to go to college. Amid all this doom, gloom and uncertainty, the country will turn to what has been a dependable source of pride: the Dream Team. Since Kobe Bryant and LeBron James teamed up in 2008, USA Basketball has won four straight Olympic gold medals — a significant and soothing feat that has helped cover up the other signs of American slippage. However, managing director Grant Hill, Coach Steve Kerr and the rest of the national team find themselves needing to pull out all the stops to extend the streak in Paris. After an inexperienced American squad led by Anthony Edwards got beat by the Germans, Lithuanians and the Canadians at the World Cup, veteran A-listers such as James, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry quickly  . Yet questions abound. Will the headliners be healthy and enthusiastic participants once the NBA’s marathon season is complete? Will Kerr, like Mike Krzyzewski and Gregg Popovich before him, be able to mesh his team’s big personalities on a short timetable? Or will international superstars such as Nikola Jokic or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander slay Goliath? The Americans will arrive in France as heavy favorites, but it took   to escape with gold in Tokyo. USA Basketball is no longer the unbeatable force that it was in 1992 with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, yet expectations remain as high as ever. If the Americans are toppled on the biggest international stage for the first time in two decades, a swift and severe backlash will inevitably follow.  When the business of the WNBA is discussed, the same hot-button issues inevitably are raised. Potential expansion from 12 teams. Potential expansion of roster sizes. Improving travel accommodations and increasing chartered flights. Addressing low salaries. All of those things ultimately revolve around a new upcoming media rights deal, which is expected to bring an influx of cash into the league. The current deal with ESPN is set to expire after the 2025 season, and the new contract could impact each of the above issues. Last summer, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert   the next three to five years will set the course for the next 30 to 40 seasons. A more lucrative deal could be game-changing. So the league’s task is to do everything in its power to maximize the worth of that deal. A major step was   of an expansion team in the Bay Area, awarded to the owners of the Golden State Warriors. The plan has been to expand by two teams, and the Bay Area team is scheduled to begin play in the 2025 season. The league will want to announce another team ready to play that season as a bargaining chip to potential broadcast partners, expanding the footprint of the league into a pair of new television markets. Interest in the league and women’s basketball in general has continued to climb. The WNBA announced   in 2023, along with increased attendance and digital engagement. Viewership for the NCAA women’s tournament Final Four, Elite Eight and Sweet 16  , according to ESPN, with 9.9 million watching the final. By comparison, the World Series averaged 9.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. The 2023 draft could include players who are already household names with huge followings in Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers and Angel Reese. The time is now for the WNBA to capitalize with a media deal that could have an enormous future financial impact. What will the league do to facilitate that in 2024? —  Just kidding. But the problem with projecting the future of college sports — or even attempting to in a superficial way — is that it’s perhaps harder to do than picking the two teams that will win roughly seven or eight football games next season and then clash in Boise. Nevertheless, some other things to look out for in this rapidly changing landscape: Will (any) college athletes be classified as employees of their schools or conferences in 2024? What will come of   to sift the highest-spending schools into their own subdivision and allow all schools to pay athletes directly through NIL deals and uncapped “education-related” money? Will the NCAA finally convince Congress to grant it an antitrust exemption, shielding it from current and future litigation? For that matter, will the NCAA ever stop  ? And sure, will there be a Final Four in April before the sky falls, because how could the sky hold up with all this money flowing to athletes? Stay tuned.  The NFL is the nation’s most popular and prosperous sports league, and it really isn’t close. Through the Week 14 games, the average NFL game drew 17.8 million viewers, and 72 of the 75 most-watched shows on television since the start of the season were NFL games. Josh Harris’s group   from Daniel Snyder this year for $6.05 billion.  The league has broadcasting deals worth more than $110 billion over 11 years. The issue is: Where does the NFL go from here, after it already is at the country’s sports mountaintop? The league’s leaders and the owners of its 32 franchise must avoid complacency. That’s why the NFL is expanding its scope of international games in the search for new overseas markets, planning   next season and doubling the number of international games per season to as many as eight beginning in 2025 (plus the possibility for a ninth involving the Jacksonville Jaguars in London). It’s why the league has made a commitment to broadcasting its games increasingly through streaming, putting the Thursday night package on Amazon Prime and placing the NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube, seeking a younger audience. It’s why the NFL and teams have  , in a bid to intensify viewer engagement and create lucrative new revenue streams through partnerships. The NFL must be careful not to overdo it. The attempt to squeeze ever more out of an already thriving business is tricky. The spread of legal sports gambling in particular is potentially problematic, given it intensifies the scrutiny on a variety of integrity-of-the-game issues ranging from the quality of the officiating to the accuracy of teams’ injury reporting. But the NFL knows it can’t stand still. How it strikes that balance in the coming months and years between what has worked so well to this point and what could work better in the future will determine the extent to which the NFL continues to thrive. —  The pro golf world starts the new year in a similar place that it began the last one — mired in chaos and uncertainty — but the stakes feel much higher. Last year the sport was facing an existential crisis, at a crossroads for survival, at least in the case of the PGA Tour. With  , the tour and LIV Golf, its Saudi-backed competitor, are not quite friends but also not mortal enemies — at least for the time being. But the entire sport is still on shaky ground, and it’s not clear if the economics underpinning professional golf are in any way sustainable. The PGA Tour and LIV Golf’s benefactors sought to unite the golf world when they announced   in early June, but the ensuing seven months only brought more confusion. Players have been divided into factions; the PGA Tour’s talent roster and weekly fields have been watered down; tour players distrust tour leadership; sponsors and broadcasters are left with weekly events with less intrigue; and LIV is still enthusiastically pushing a product that is slow to catch on. The PGA Tour spent the final weeks of 2023 negotiating with both the Saudi Public Investment Fund, which owns LIV Golf, as well as   about investing in the tour. If the deals get finalized, billions will be injected into the sport, PGA Tour players stand to get an equity stake in the organization and the tour will see its most pressing financial concerns alleviated. LIV, meanwhile, could be further legitimized for a mainstream audience, though it’s still not clear if there’s an appetite for LIV or a team-golf concept, particularly in the United States. But any return on investment is questionable, as sponsors and broadcast partners are seemingly tapped out — Wells Fargo and AT&T have recently decided to stop sponsoring tour events in Charlotte and Dallas — and the sport has essentially spent the past couple of years pushing away its fans. The wearied golf fan who has tried to weather this storm will see the world’s top players compete against each other just a few times a year at the majors, where only a handful of LIV players can even tee it up. If 2023 was about financial stability and appeasing players, the new year will have to be about presenting a product that golf fans want to see. And if the proposed partnership somehow falls apart, both the men’s game and its anxious fan base stand to continue suffering for the foreseeable future. —  On the ice, the quality of the NHL has never been higher. Play is faster, while players are more skilled — and feel more freedom to try out the kind of highlight-reel plays that wouldn’t have been tolerated in previous eras. Whether it’s Edmonton’s Connor McDavid using his skating and puck skills to pull off an end-to-end rush or 18-year-old Chicago rookie Connor Bedard showing off a shot that’s already among the best in the league, the game itself is in great shape. But off the ice, the NHL has taken a hit. Commissioner Gary Bettman has been in his role for 30 years, and the league hasn’t been an innovator in recent years. As proof: In November, the NHL launched NHL Breakaway, its NFT digital collectible program for hockey highlights. In contrast, NBA Top Shot, the NBA’s version of the same concept, launched in 2020, early in the NFT boom. Culturally, decisions such as banning special warm-up jerseys — after a handful of players refused to wear Pride-themed jerseys in warm-ups ahead of their teams’ annual LGBTQ+ awareness games — have created a perception the NHL has little interest in inclusion. The salary cap has also been stagnant since the beginning of the pandemic, hamstringing teams that signed players to long-term contracts before the pandemic, based on projections of the cap going up. Many NHL executives believe the nearly flat cap (it has risen  ) has limited trade activity, at a time when NBA teams are making blockbuster trades left and right — and drawing fan interest and engagement from those moves. The latest projection has the salary cap   by $4.2 million to $87.7 million next season. That should help solve one of the issues, but how the NHL is perceived on a cultural level — particularly among the younger demographic the   — will remain at the forefront in the new year.  For the past 30 years, the business of sports has followed a similar pattern. Every time a team — any team, really — signs a new TV deal, revenue shoots up. This is predominantly how teams have paid ever-escalating salaries to players (and college coaches). It has been a key driver of the team valuations that have pushed into the billions. But  . Around 100 million American homes had cable TV a decade ago, but there are now around 70 million, and the number keeps dropping. Cable companies are fleeing  ; ESPN faces headwinds like never before; and questions remain about how much tech companies would pay for these rights. In 2024, the NBA will sign new broadcast deals; a complicated bankruptcy case involving Bally Sports, which owns the local broadcasts rights for dozens of MLB, NHL and NBA teams, will continue to unfold; and teams will continue to look for new distribution models. How this plays out, and where teams and leagues find the missing money, is the most important story in U.S. sports right now.  After two covid Olympics competed before empty stands, Paris wants this summer’s Olympics to be spectacular. Plans call for the July 26 Opening Ceremonies to be on the Seine River, with the athletes parading on boats at sunset to the Trocadero across the river from the Eiffel Tower for a show that will largely take place on the water. Throughout the Games, events will be held in and around some of the city’s most famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, Palace of Versailles and Place de la Concorde. With fans finally able to attend for the first time since the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Games, these Olympics in the middle of Paris have a chance to make for riveting television. But the Olympics have been clouded by doping and bid-rigging scandals, the wasteful building of unnecessary stadiums and Games held in countries (Russia and China) with histories of human rights abuses. Russia has been a problem for the Olympics since   at the 2014 Sochi Games and subsequent sanctions at succeeding Olympics. The International Olympic Committee   because of the country’s attempt to claim athletes in some of Ukraine’s regions as its own. Still, the IOC, controversially,   in Paris as individual neutral athletes, without their nation’s flag, anthem or colors, as long as they haven’t supported the war or been a part of Russia’s military. Olympic television ratings in the United States have been dropping, showing a potential decline in interest. Some of this dip may be attributed to the fact that four of the past five Games have been in Asia, half a day ahead of most American time zones. Paris, with its plan to show off the city and make its Games a glamorous event, wants to bring some of the old excitement back. Will it be enough to wipe away some of the sour feelings about recent Olympics? Or will scandals and the lingering debate over Russia hang like a dark cloud over Paris’s ambitious Olympics?  The coming year is not a World Cup year for the U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams, but it does loom large for different reasons. By participating in Copa América — the fabled South American tournament that will take place   — the men’s team will face its stiffest tests before the 2026 World Cup is staged in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Coach Gregg Berhalter’s contract runs through 2026, but failure to advance to Copa’s knockout stage would sound alarms about the program’s direction and perhaps prompt new sporting director Matt Crocker to consider changes. Berhalter has been working with a young, exciting roster — one that should begin to show capacity to not only compete with, but beat, big teams in serious competitions, especially in a dress rehearsal of sorts for the World Cup on home grounds two years later. He has the pieces; can he make them fit into his plans at a big moment? The women will head to the Paris Olympics seeking to rebound from   at the World Cup last summer — the poorest performance at a major tournament in program history. The team also foundered at the previous two Olympics, and with many traditional soccer-playing countries finally investing in the women’s game, the U.S. pathway to trophies and medals has become treacherous. For that reason, the U.S. Soccer Federation  , one of the game’s most-respected coaches. Because she will not step into the full-time coaching job   when Chelsea’s season ends in Europe, she’ll have little time for Olympic preparation. In hiring someone who wasn’t immediately available, the USSF is playing the long game, hoping the highly regarded Hayes not only restores U.S. excellence by invigorating the current squad but reshapes the program at large. Olympic women’s soccer is no longer as important as the World Cup, but it remains a substantial competition the United States has won four times in seven attempts. There is no better way to get back on track — and win over casual fans — than winning gold.  The most existentially pertinent question tennis faces in 2024 is about new Saudi Arabian investment in the sport — both if it happens (many decision-makers view it as an inevitability) and what form it might take. There have been reports about both a potential Saudi-run tournament and an additional stop located in Saudi Arabia, as well as extended talk of the WTA’s potential involvement with Saudi money. None of that is nearly as fun as debating the sport itself. Here’s something worth pondering instead: Will men’s tennis have a first-time major winner in 2024? It is nearly a given that the women’s game will; 2014 was the most recent year in which all four Grand Slam winners were repeat champions. But for the men, the question is as much about who has the talent and chutzpah to break through at the Grand Slam level as it is about the (glacially) slow erosion of Novak Djokovic’s singular hold on the game. Are we in for an era of Djokovic battling   and Alcaraz alone, or is a new generation legitimately breaking through? Italy’s Jannik Sinner, 22, is a top contender among the youngsters, and there are still many reasons to believe Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas (25) will win a major one day. As for Djokovic’s continued dominance, would anyone be surprised if he took two or three major trophies in 2024? Little else in sports feels as inevitable as that. — ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/sports-questions-2024/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 18:19:00,
"RICHMOND — For his first two years in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin was not forced to act on any gun legislation, as Republicans and Democrats in a divided Capitol defeated each other’s bills to expand or restrict access to firearms. That will likely change as Democrats take control of both the House and Senate in Virginia’s General Assembly session beginning Jan. 10. Among the gun-control bills that could land on the Republican governor’s desk are measures to ban the sale of new assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, which are often used in mass killings. RICHMOND — For his first two years in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin was not forced to act on any gun legislation, as Republicans and Democrats in a divided Capitol defeated each other’s bills to expand or restrict access to firearms. That will likely change as Democrats take control of both the House and Senate in Virginia’s General Assembly session beginning Jan. 10. Among the gun-control bills that could land on the Republican governor’s desk are measures to ban the sale of new assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, which are often used in mass killings. Youngkin could always veto those bills and Democrats, with slim majorities in both chambers, would lack the numbers to override him. Some Democrats say that outcome would at least pin Youngkin down on a thorny issue that he mostly sidestepped on his way to the Executive Mansion. “He’s going to have to decide if he’s truly a suburban dad in a vest who cares about children and public safety or he cares more about the right-wing base,” said state Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria), who has a bill ready to file to ban the carrying of certain semiautomatic weapons in public. But Youngkin has been so reticent on the subject that some Democrats hope — and some gun-rights activists fear — that he might be open to some restrictions. “He’s been untested. He doesn’t speak about it much. We’re in the dark,” said Philip Van Cleave, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a gun-rights group. “I have no reason to think that he wouldn’t veto them, but I don’t have any kind of 100 percent surety that some bills wouldn’t potentially be signed.” “The governor will review any legislation when it comes to his desk,” Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez said. Youngkin was vocal about gun rights when he was seeking his party’s gubernatorial nomination in 2021, vowing to roll back a host of gun-control laws passed the year before, when Democrats enjoyed control of the governorship and both chambers. But he also avoided getting pinned down on specifics by not answering surveys from the VCDL and the National Rifle Association — a first in recent memory for a successful statewide GOP nominee. He downplayed the issue after winning the nomination, as he sought to appeal to critical suburban swing voters, typically voicing support only for unspecified “constitutional rights.” Since taking office, Youngkin has said little on guns, even when pressed to address the issue after high-profile shootings in the state, including a   at a Chesapeake Walmart in November 2022, 10 days after   at the University of Virginia. After a   in Newport News in January, House Republicans called for greater school discipline and Democrats sought to restrict access to guns. Youngkin’s response: “This investigation is ongoing. It’s heart-wrenching and the results of which aren’t fully known yet. I applaud the leadership in Newport News.” “There’s little on the record from Youngkin on the issue of gun violence,” said Lori Haas, one of Richmond’s most prominent gun-control advocates since her daughter was injured in the 2007 mass  killing at Virginia Tech. “We will learn a lot when these bills go to his desk and learn whether he truly cares about the citizens for the commonwealth.” Sen. R. Creigh Deeds (D-Charlottesville) and Del. Dan Helmer (D-Fairfax) have filed identical bills that would ban the sale, transfer and possession of assault-style weapons, though with a provision to exempt those already in private hands. The bills would raise the age for possessing assault weapons, regardless of when they were made, from 18 to 21. They also would prohibit the sale of large-capacity magazines. A handful of Senate Democrats, Deeds among them, scuttled  in February 2020, nine months after   at a Virginia Beach municipal building. Opponents said they were concerned about the prospect of forcing gun-owners to give up weapons they had lawfully purchased. Deeds said that issue has been resolved in the new legislation by grandfathering existing weapons, expressing confidence that measures will clear both chambers this time. “We’ll just have to have a conversation with the governor,” he said. “And I’m ready to do that.” Helmer, who served as a U.S. Army intelligence officer overseas, said he hoped Youngkin embraces the legislation as a way to enhance public safety. “It is my hope that the governor is serious when he talks about keeping our communities safe, and the way to keep our communities safe is to make sure our children don’t die in massacres at our schools perpetuated by extremists carrying weapons similar to those I carried in Iraq and Afghanistan,” Helmer said. Taylor McKee, Virginia state director for the National Rifle Association, took a dim view of the bills. “The term ‘assault weapon’ is a term contrived by the gun control lobby to demonize widely owned semiautomatic rifles, which are used for a variety of lawful purposes including self-defense,” he said in an email to The Washington Post. “A government-mandated study following the 1994 federal ‘assault weapons’ ban found that these firearms are rarely used by criminals and therefore had no impact on crime.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/29/virginia-general-assembly-gun-bills-youngkin/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 17:39:00,
"A flurry of layoffs at the beginning of 2023 came amid panic that the U.S. economy was in for a painful downturn. But then an unexpected thing happened: the prominent layoffs petered out. A surge of economic activity, particularly in the second half of the year, helped stabilize the labor market and protect millions of American jobs. There were still plenty of job cuts in certain pockets of the economy, but many economists say the situation could have been much worse. A flurry of layoffs at the beginning of 2023 came amid panic that the U.S. economy was in for a painful downturn. But then an unexpected thing happened: the prominent layoffs petered out. A surge of economic activity, particularly in the second half of the year, helped stabilize the labor market and protect millions of American jobs. There were still plenty of job cuts in certain pockets of the economy, but many economists say the situation could have been much worse. “We’ve seen that a lot of companies have been choosing to pull back on hiring,"" rather than conduct layoffs, said Cory Stahle, an economist at job searching site Indeed. Some of the most prominent cuts occurred in late 2022 and the first months of this year in the tech and media sectors: Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, HP, and the parent companies of Google and Facebook all cut several thousand workers. Despite the cuts, the U.S. job market has remained remarkably strong throughout the year, most recently adding  , slower but solid growth that lowered the unemployment rate to 3.7 percent. In further signs of the economy’s resilience, inflation has dropped to  , from 2022′s peak of 9.1, and   at a blockbuster pace last quarter. Because of high interest rates and the cost of capital, many companies are still remaining cautious on spending. But as 2024 begins, layoffs have become more measured, said Aaron Terrazas, chief economist at the employment website Glassdoor. “Layoffs continue to trickle in, but the tone of them has changed,” he said. “The motivation was general economic fear early in the year. Now they’re certainly more surgical.” From Google to Goldman Sachs, here’s a look back at notable layoffs since late 2022. The consulting firm Accenture in late March said it planned to cut 2.5 percent of its workforce, roughly 19,000 jobs, after lowering its annual revenue and profit projections. The company had expected revenue growth of between 8 and 11 percent, but it revised that forecast down to between 8 and 10 percent. The company wrote in a securities filing that it expects more than half of the layoffs to occur among employees in “nonbillable corporate functions.” Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is cutting about 12,000 jobs,  . He said that the job cuts — estimated to be 6 percent of the workforce — will occur across the company and that the decision came after a “rigorous review.” Alphabet nodded to the tremendous growth the company experienced over the past two years, but demand has waned with the return to in-person life and with interest rate increases, which have made borrowing more expensive. Pichai said that the company had hired to meet the prior surge but that the economic reality the company faces now is far different. The Seattle-based e-commerce giant announced in November 2022 plans to slash roughly   — many from its human resources, devices and retail divisions — and raised that total to   in January. In March, Amazon said it planned to lay off an  , citing an “uncertain economy.” (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and the newspaper’s interim CEO, Patty Stonesifer, sits on Amazon’s board.)  that Apple planned to lay off a small number employees from its retail teams, which are responsible for the construction and upkeep of the company’s global retail stores, citing sources familiar with the plans. At the time, Apple had been the only tech giant to not announce major cuts to its workforce. Still, it is pulling back in some areas, including by trimming contractors such as engineers, recruiters and security guards, according to Bloomberg. In January, the cryptocurrency exchange announced that it was eliminating 950 jobs in an effort to reduce operating expenses. In a  , chief executive Brian Armstrong wrote that the cuts come as the industry “trended downward along with the broader macroeconomy” in 2022. In February, the PC maker is shedding about 5 percent of its workforce, or around 6,650 positions, Plunging demand for personal computers has forced the company to enact a broader cost-cutting program that also includes a hiring freeze and a pullback on travel. “What we know is market conditions continue to erode with an uncertain future,” Dell Vice Chairman Jeff Clarke told employees, according to a Feb. 6 SEC filing. In February, the e-signature company announced plans to lay off about 10 percent of its workforce as part of a broader restructuring. An earlier round of layoffs affected about 9 percent of the company, according to CNBC, which reported on Feb. 16 that the latest cuts will bring DocuSign’s head count to around 700. Swollen by pandemic hiring, the food delivery company in November 2022 shed 1,250 corporate jobs, about 6 percent of its workforce. Chief executive Tony Xu said in a note to employees that company leaders were “not as rigorous as we should have been in managing our team growth,” as the company’s revenue growth was eclipsed by operating expenses. The cloud storage and software firm said April 27 that it would lay off 500 employees, about 16 percent of the company. Chief executive Drew Houston   that Dropbox’s growth had slowed as a result of the larger economic downturn even though the company remains profitable. He also wrote that the company will be increasing its investment in artificial intelligence and needs to reorganize its staffing to prioritize those skills. In February, CNN reported that the telecommunications giant plans to cut a total of 8,500 positions, or 8 percent of its workforce, by the end of 2023. The company experienced lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as equipment sales slowed in the United States, according to Reuters. The online market platform announced Dec. 13, that it was cutting 225 employees, or 11 percent of its staff. Josh Silverman, Etsy’s chief executive, blamed a “very challenging macro and competitive environment,” as well as lagging sales and growing employee expenses. “This is ultimately not a sustainable trajectory and we must change it,” he said in a  . In June, the food delivery platform said it would lay off approximately 400 employees, or about 15 percent of its workforce, according to a   sent to company workers. The company’s operating costs have risen faster than revenue, CEO Howard Migdal wrote in his message. The computer giant said   2022 that it would trim 4,000 to 6,000 workers by the end of 2025 in an effort to reduce costs. The announcement came after HP reported an 11.2 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue compared with the same period in 2021; full-year sales dipped 0.8 percent. The technology company announced plans in January to  , or about 1.5 percent of its global workforce. IBM said the cuts were related to earlier divestitures of its Kyndryl and Watson Health businesses, although those moves took place long before the job cuts were announced in late January. The job-searching company announced in March that it would lay off 2,200 people, or 15 percent of its staff. In a March 22   to staff, chief executive Chris Hyams cited a decline in U.S. job openings, which he predicted would fall even further in the next few years. “With future job openings at or below pre-pandemic levels, our organization is simply too big for what lies ahead,” added Hyams, who said he’d take a 25 percent cut in base pay. The cryptocurrency exchange said in a November 2022   that it would slash 30 percent of its payroll, or 1,100 workers, to “adapt to current market conditions.” The industry experienced a   in 2022, erasing billions of dollars of investments. The Microsoft-owned networking platform said Oct. 16 that it would lay off 668 employees as part of an ongoing reorganization, according to a company  . In May, the company laid off 716 employees as part of a phaseout of the company’s China-based local jobs app, InCareer, according to a public letter from chief executive Ryan Roslansky. The ride-share giant announced April 27 that it would lay off more than a quarter of its workforce, or 1,072 employees,  . It will also eliminate 250 vacant positions. The separations will cost Lyft as much as $47 million in severance payments, the company said. In November 2022, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram  , or 13 percent of its workforce, in an effort to rein in expenses and focus on transforming its advertising business. The cuts underscored a tumultuous new period in Silicon Valley, whose tech giants have been long regarded as recession-proof. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder, has said declines in online shopping and advertising competition led to a decline in revenue. His company has also bet big on a push to create a virtual world often called  . In March, Zuckerberg announced that an additional   would be cut. In January,   it planned to lay off 10,000 employees,   it was part of a restructuring plan to focus on areas of growth and brace the company for an economic downturn. In January, online payment company PayPal said it will lay off 2,000 employees, or about 7 percent of its global workforce. In a   published to the company’s website, chief executive Dan Schulman said PayPal had made significant progress in addressing “the challenging macroeconomic environment” but added that the company has “more work to do,” as it restructures and focuses on core priorities. In March, the streaming media device company said it planned to cut about 6 percent of its workforce, or about 200 employees, according to a  . The company said the layoffs are part of a restructuring plan designed to reduce operating expenses and prioritize projects that may offer a “higher return on investment.” The company also shed 200 employees   2022, citing the “current economic conditions in our industry.” The cloud-computing giant — whose products include the popular workplace chat system Slack, as well as tools for sales, marketing and customer service — announced in January cost-cutting plans that include   of its workforce. Salesforce has more than 79,000 employees, meaning the layoffs affected nearly 8,000 people. Co-chief executive Marc Benioff said the company hired too many people when its sales surged during the pandemic. In September, Benioff told Bloomberg the company planned to hire about 3,300 According to a January earnings report, the European software giant announced plans to eliminate 2,800 employees, or 2.5 percent of its workforce, citing a “targeted restructuring” and plans to “strengthen its core business and improve overall process efficiency.” Shopify  about 20 percent of its staff in May. On Dec. 4, the music streaming company announced plans to lay off 17 percent of its staff — its third round of layoffs this year — citing slower economic growth and more expensive capital. Chief executive Daniel Ek said there is a need to ensure the company is “right-sized for the challenges ahead.” This came after Spotify announced cuts in June and January. First that it would slash 6 percent of its workforce, citing the “need to become more efficient” and over-hiring during the pandemic. “I take full accountability for the moves that got us here today,” Ek wrote in a  , which also discussed reorganization plans. And later, an additional 200 jobs would be cut as it makes changes to its podcast strategy. Online payment company Stripe said in November 2022 that it would cut 14 percent of its workforce. In a memo to staff in November, the company said the 1,100 job cuts will return Stripe’s head count to almost what it was in February 2022. The wireless service giant announced plans to lay off 5,000 workers, or just under 7 percent of its U.S. workforce, according to   sent to employees Aug. 24. The cuts come amid a larger cost-saving plan to improve the company’s efficiency as it faces heightened competition, chief executive Mike Sievert said in the message. Earlier this year, T-Mobile agreed to acquire Mint Mobile, the cell carrier backed by actor Ryan Reynolds, for $1.35 billion. The San Francisco-based communications technology firm announced on Feb. 13 that it would be laying off 17 percent of its workforce. That’s 1,500 jobs based on Twilio’s September 2022 head count of roughly 9,000 people, according to an  . Executives said the cuts were part of a broader restructuring plan designed to shift the company toward greater profitability. In May, Unity, which makes a software platform widely used in mobile and virtual reality games, said it planned to lay off 600 people, according to a  . The layoffs cover about 8 percent of the company’s workforce. Video-streaming company Vimeo said in early January that it would lay off about 11 percent of its staff, or about 140 people, “due to the uncertain economic environment.” Soon after Elon Musk acquired the San Francisco-based social media company formerly known as Twitter in October 2022, he fired much of the company’s top brass and . Hundreds more workers departed the next month, after   to work longer hours, The Washington Post reported. It laid off another 200 people on Feb. 25,   the New York Times. The videoconference company said in February that it would lay off 15 percent of its workforce, or 1,300 workers — and its chief executive, Eric Yuan, said he’d take a 98 percent pay cut. Yuan said the company had not assessed whether it was growing sustainably as its product became ubiquitous during pandemic lockdowns and business skyrocketed.
