Quinci King has been to at least 99 social events in the last year and a half. For his 100th, he’s throwing a banger. On Sunday, at least 100 people are coming to his Brooklyn apartment, where there will be a DJ, a champagne cup tower and special lighting, his second year in a row hosting a New Year’s party. “Was your flight canceled? Did your Airbnb fall through? Couldn’t secure a spot on that event list?” last year’s event read. “If this is you, put on your loudest outfit, and join the bad-at-planning, misfits for a night of dancing, drinking, and memories that will last a lifetime.” Like so many of his 20-something friends, this year’s event is again being organized on a rapidly growing app that brands itself as the “sexiest way” to plan parties and tracks just how many events users have attended and hosted. Its name is Partiful, and ahead of New Year’s Eve, millions of mostly under-30s are using the free app and website that lets people create event pages and send out party-related text reminders to all their guests. It has for many young people dethroned Facebook events, Paperless Post and any other way of organizing casual get-togethers. “This is where my social calendar exists,” said King, 25. “It’s probably one of the primary ways I’ve built my community since moving a little over a year ago.” Some young people like King previously used large, unwieldy group texts or Instagram stories to plan events after fleeing Facebook and shunning email-based organizers that felt too formal. But each had its downside. That’s where Partiful came in, said Shreya Murthy. She co-founded Partiful with Joy Tao, launching business operations in March 2020. “So we laid low for a while,” she told The Washington Post. They instead got to work creating a text message-based event-planning site with trendy pages that could be customized with GIFs, multicolored gradients and memes. The idea came from Murthy’s own experience trying to make friends in her 20s. She wanted to plan more group hangouts or parties to help build her community, but it was “totally chaotic,” she said, as people left Facebook and scattered to disparate services. She thought there was a way to centralize the pros of Facebook — for example, seeing attendee names — but focus it around texts, since everyone was on their phone but didn’t regularly check their emails. In 2021, as vaccines rolled out and in-person events returned, Murthy and Tao started marketing it publicly to friends and others. That year, she said the number of users was likely in the thousands. By 2022, it was in the hundreds of thousands, and by the end of this year, she said Partiful’s monthly users are in the millions and number of events are in the hundreds of thousands, seven times more than 2022. Most users are in big coastal cities, and a growing number are outside the United States and on college campuses. “I didn’t realize how hard socializing would be after college,” said Murthy. “And for an entire generation, covid made that uniquely challenging. And if we care about our mental health, if we care about our friendships, we should take socializing seriously.” Coming out of the pandemic, many young people were stuck inside for the best days of high school, college and young professional life. Partiful user Kristel Black said she and her friends stayed connected online, but were also inundated by TikTok and Instagram and all the insecurities that brought. For the 26-year-old, Partiful felt like a social media platform whose goal was different: plan things in real life, meet real people. “Everyone was just getting overwhelmed with too much social media,” said Black, a third-year medical student at the University of North Carolina from Raleigh who started using it for her 24th birthday. “People just want to be in person again, and do so with intention.” Creating a fun event page, she said, helps bring that intention, and being able to revisit the page weeks or months later helps broaden her social circles. As people who had been isolated started attending large events again, many wanted to be more deliberate, more creative about how they socialized. That changed the way many hosted, and made people more enthusiastic to do so, according to the International Housewares Association, which tracks how and how much people host home events. “Now people want themes. People want experiences,” said Dawn Evans, a trends analyst for the IHA. Partiful, some users say, helped meet that moment. A day of wholesome fun, with a talent show and yearbook photos. A night of reading friends’ creative writing. An “it feels so scary getting old” birthday party. Black said only a handful of friends use the app in Raleigh, especially compared to D.C. and New York, where she would frequently visit before she moved out of Philadelphia. Many of her Raleigh friends still use large group chats that can make her less excited for the event. But King, in Brooklyn, said it seems like everyone’s on Partiful, and he’s even started organizing smaller hangouts on the app. While technology  , it can also  . Roughly 44 million U.S. adults still   concerning levels of loneliness after the pandemic peak. Murthy hopes Partiful might be able to make people feel more connected. Katie Davis, who has researched the ways young people use social media since 2005, said many have been using the platforms to organize their in-person lives since at least 2007. But, she said, more social media today is overcome with ads, something Partiful so far avoids, and there are many more platforms available. “Partiful is clearly branding itself for the Gen Z culture,” said Davis, a University of Washington professor who directs its  . “It’s tapping into the cultural vibe of this younger generation. It’s using their language. It’s using their aesthetic.” Under a tab on its site called “party inspo,” short for inspiration, Partiful suggests events called “middle school slay,” “girl dinner” and “dad bodz.” Davis said Partiful’s success “probably” has something to do with pandemic isolation, in addition to its design. Partiful is not profitable — its founders say it doesn’t sell user data — but it had raised over $7 million in funding by fall of 2022, and more since, Murthy said. She declined to provide more specifics. To try to monetize the platform, Partiful plans to eventually sell party apparel like disposable cameras and potentially provide party support services. Giliann Karon, 26, thinks of the site as a social media for real life, and for New Year’s Eve, she’s of course going to a Partiful party. The host used the app to tell her and other guests the event would have karaoke, a balcony and would be shoes off, so plan outfits accordingly. Most of Karon’s friends really started using Partiful this spring or summer in D.C., she said. It helped her make what she called “loose friends,” or people she’d enjoy seeing at larger gatherings but might not hang out with one-on-one. When she’d host a party, she could go to past event pages and easily invite people she’d connected with, even if she hadn’t exchanged numbers or followed them on social media. “People our age want an easier way to be together,” she said. “It’s so easy to get caught up in every other social media app. Partiful is refreshing because it has one purpose, and one purpose only: to bring people together.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/31/partiful-gen-z-new-years-eve/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 06:00:00,
"Last weekend, my Tesla Model Y received an over-the-air update to make its driver-assistance software safer. In my first test drive of the updated Tesla, it blew through two stop signs without even slowing down. In December, Tesla issued its largest-ever recall, affecting almost all of its 2 million cars. It is like the software updates you get on your phone, except this was supposed to prevent drivers from misusing Tesla’s Autopilot software. Last weekend, my Tesla Model Y received an over-the-air update to make its driver-assistance software safer. In my first test drive of the updated Tesla, it blew through two stop signs without even slowing down. In December, Tesla issued its largest-ever recall, affecting almost all of its 2 million cars. It is like the software updates you get on your phone, except this was supposed to prevent drivers from misusing Tesla’s Autopilot software. The underlying issue is that while a government investigation prompted the recall, Tesla got to drive what went into the software update — and it appears not to want to alienate some customers by imposing new limits on its tech. It’s a warning about how unprepared we are for an era where vehicles can seem a lot more  , but are still 4,000-pound speed machines that require a different level of scrutiny and transparency. Tesla’s   follows an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into crashes involving Autopilot. My Washington Post colleagues found that   have involved Tesla drivers using Autopilot on roads where the software was not intended to be used, such as streets with cross traffic. These crashes have killed or severely wounded not only Tesla drivers, but bystanders. Tesla says its Autopilot software makes its cars safer overall than those without it. Announcing the recall, NHTSA said it was supposed to “encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility” when using the technology, and would include “additional checks” on drivers “using the feature outside controlled access highways.” But Tesla wasn’t specific about what, exactly, would change with the update to counteract misuse. Tesla didn’t respond to my request for comment. NHTSA’s director of communications, Veronica Morales, said the agency’s “investigation remains open” and the agency will “continue to examine the performance of recalled vehicles.” I found we have every reason to be skeptical this recall does much of anything. It goes without saying: Don’t try this at home. I was quite surprised the Tesla would just blow through a stop sign, and activated Autopilot only near stops when there weren’t others around. I was only simulating not paying attention to understand the software’s capabilities and limitations, which are now clear. I took my Tesla out on two identical test drives, before and after the update. My family leases a blue Tesla Model Y, one of America’s best-selling cars, which we’ve been largely content with. (Tesla can be very clever with software, and one time my car even bore  .) The process of simply getting the recall was itself a red flag for a lack of urgency about this fix. Unlike on a phone, where you can go to settings to look for updates, my car had no button to look for or prompt a download. Tesla’s user manual advised updates would download automatically if I had strong WiFi, so I moved my router outdoors near my parked car. When the recall finally arrived — a week and a half later — it contained a number of other unrelated features as well as a patch on top of its original release. I was using an Autopilot function known as Autosteer, which Tesla dubs “Beta” software but makes widely available. It automatically turns the wheel to keep it within lane lines. Drivers of recent Tesla models can easily activate it by pushing down twice on the right-hand stalk next to the wheel. In fine print and user manuals most drivers probably haven’t pored over, Tesla says that Autosteer “is designed for use on highways that have a center divider, clear lane markings, and no cross-traffic.” It adds: “Please use it only if you will pay attention to the road, keep your hands on the steering wheel, and be prepared to take over at any time.” As the crashes spotlighted by The Post investigation indicate, it isn’t clear to some drivers where you’re supposed to use Autosteer and what, exactly, it will do for you. It’s not nearly as advanced as Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” capability, which requires a $200 per month subscription to access and is designed to be used on city streets. Unfortunately, little about the recall forces Autosteer to operate only in situations it was designed to handle. Nothing changed after the recall about what seems to me to be the most critical issue: the places in which Autosteer will activate. I was able to use it well beyond highways, including city streets with stop signs, stop lights and significant curves. Autosteer flew into speed bumps at full speed, causing a raucous ride. This is bad software design. Teslas already contain mapping systems that know which street you’re on. Tesla’s surround-view cameras can identify stop signs and cross traffic. Why doesn’t Autopilot’s software pay attention to that data and allow Autosteer to activate only on roads it was designed for? The only factor I experienced that seemed to cause it to not operate (and flash a “temporarily unavailable” message) was if streets lacked clear paint lines. The two times Autosteer allowed my car to roll right through intersections with stop signs were especially nerve wracking. I could tell from icons on the car’s screen that it could see the sign, yet it did not disengage Autosteer or stop. After digging around Tesla’s website, I discovered that   obeying stop signs and stop lights is a function included for those who pay for Full Self-Driving. Should you really have to pay extra to keep the software your car comes with by default from doing reckless things? Tesla’s superfans may argue they don’t want their car (or the government) telling them where they can use certain functions. But only Tesla is truly able to judge the conditions where its Autosteer software is safe — that information is opaque to drivers, and clearly people keep misjudging it. I believe cars will get safer with self-driving and driver-assistance software, but need to tap into all available data to do so. “NHTSA must set their sights beyond this recall and limit Tesla’s Autosteer feature to the limited-access highways for which it was designed,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), with whom I shared my test results. The biggest recall change my tests did reveal was how the car warned me about being attentive to the road while Autosteer was activated. But it’s subtle at best. At the top of Tesla’s release notes for the recall is that it has “improved visibility” of driver-warning alerts on its main screen. Looking at my own before and after photos, I can see these newer messages — which often ask you to apply slight force to the wheel — have larger type, include an icon and now show up in the upper third of the screen. It is good for critical messages to not require reading glasses. But I also wonder whether more distractions on a screen might actually take people’s attention away from the road. Tesla’s recall release notes also suggest the warnings will come more often, saying there is increased “strictness” of driver attentiveness requirements when Autosteer is active and the car is approaching “traffic lights and stop signs off-highway.” Online, some frequent Autosteer users have complained that the recall gives them hands-on-the-wheel warning “nags” much too often. In my pre-recall test drive, I was able to go for 75 seconds on a San Francisco street with traffic lights without my hands on the wheel before getting a warning. On the same road after the update, I could go for 60 seconds without my hands on the wheel. I wasn’t able to discern what prompted the hands-on-the-wheel alerts I received. On roads with stop lights, I did sometimes get a warning ahead of the intersection — but usually just deactivated the software myself to stay safe. Ahead of the two stop signs the car ran through, one time I got a hands-on warning, and one time I did not. More worrisome is how the recall handled my car’s interior camera. It’s used along with pressure on the steering wheel to check whether the driver is paying attention and not looking at their phone. When I covered the lens with a smiley-face sticker — a trick I read about on social media from other Tesla owners — the car would still activate Autosteer. The system did send more warnings about keeping my hands on the wheel while the camera was covered. But I don’t understand why Tesla would allow you to activate Autosteer at all when the camera is either malfunctioning or being monkeyed with. Finally, the update release notes said Tesla’s systems would suspend Autopilot for drivers who collect five “Forced Autopilot Disengagements” — a term for when the software shuts itself off when it detects improper use. I was not suspended during my tests, and received only one forced disengagement, which didn’t stop me from re-engaging Autopilot shortly after. How could the government let this pass? I also shared my results with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn), who told me we need a recall of the recall. “This is tragedy waiting to happen,” he said. “We are going to be demanding additional action from Tesla, and also that NHTSA show some real legal muscle against [CEO] Elon Musk’s mockery.” NHTSA’s Morales declined to comment on the specifics of my experience. But she said in a statement that the law, known as the Vehicle Safety Act, “puts the burden on the manufacturer” to develop safety fixes. “NHTSA does not preapprove remedies,” she said. Instead, “the agency will monitor field and other data to determine its adequacy, including field monitoring of the effects of the remedy in addressing the safety problem and testing any software or hardware changes in recalled vehicles.” Which aspects of the performance would violate NHTSA’s requirements? And how long will this take? Morales said only that the agency’s Vehicle Research and Test Center in Ohio has several Tesla vehicles that it will use for testing. “Consumers should never attempt to create their own vehicle test scenarios, or use real people or public roadways to test the performance of vehicle technology,” Morales added. “Intentional unsafe use of a vehicle is dangerous and may be in violation of State and local laws.” Yet every Tesla driver who is using Autopilot with the update is testing the performance of the technology while we wait for NHTSA to do its own. It’s hard to see how post-release review serves public safety in an era where software, and especially driver-assistance capabilities, introduces very new kinds of risk. Compare a current Tesla to your phone. Apps are subjected to prerelease review by Apple and Google before they’re made available to download. They must meet transparency requirements. Why should a car get less scrutiny than a phone? “Tesla’s recall makes clear that the cars of the future require smarter safety solutions than of the past,” Markey said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/31/tesla-autopilot-recall-test/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 06:00:00,
"2023 has been widely described as the AI industry’s “Oppenheimer” moment. J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb” for his leading role in the Manhattan Project,  with the deadly consequences of his invention. Director Christopher Nolan reawakened public interest in the scientist’s life this year with the   detailing his tortured life. Many saw parallels between Oppenheimer’s attempts to warn policymakers about nuclear proliferation and modern alarm over the possible consequences of artificial intelligence, with some top technologists saying AI   with nuclear weapons. 2023 has been widely described as the AI industry’s “Oppenheimer” moment. J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb” for his leading role in the Manhattan Project,  with the deadly consequences of his invention. Director Christopher Nolan reawakened public interest in the scientist’s life this year with the   detailing his tortured life. Many saw parallels between Oppenheimer’s attempts to warn policymakers about nuclear proliferation and modern alarm over the possible consequences of artificial intelligence, with some top technologists saying AI   with nuclear weapons. As Nolan’s film took over theaters this summer, the debate over how to develop AI safely and responsibly was reaching a peak in Washington. As    for discussions about AI at the White House, tech executives and senators saw an opportunity to use Oppenheimer’s struggles to illustrate the morally complex stakes of the debate over the emerging technology. But Silicon Valley’s fascination with Oppenheimer has left Nolan with “conflicted” feelings. “It’s a wonderful thing that scientists and technologists of all stripes are looking to history and looking at that moment and worrying about unintended consequences,” Nolan said in a recent interview at the Hay-Adams hotel in Washington. “But I also think it’s important to bear in mind that the nuclear threat is a singular threat to humanity.” Nolan says that the atomic bomb was a “force of destruction,” and policymakers need to address that differently than a tool such as artificial intelligence. He warns against viewing AI as a special case and cautioned against ascribing “godlike” attributes to the technology in ways that could allow companies and governments to deflect responsibility. “We need to view it as a tool, and we need accountability for the people who wield the tool and the ways they wield the tool,” he said. Some technologists are warning of “doomsday” style scenarios in which AI grows an ability to think on its own and attempts to destroy humanity. Their warnings have resonated on the global stage, and they were a key focus of an   to discuss AI safety at Bletchley Park, a historic site in Britain where Allied code-breakers deciphered secret German messages during World War II. But Nolan warns that focusing on those potential outcomes distracts from solving problems companies and policymakers could address now. “It lets everybody off the hook if we’re looking at the most extreme scenarios,” he said. Already, AI systems are ingesting his work and other Hollywood movies to generate photos and videos, he said. Nolan says policymakers need to address the ways that AI systems are taking people’s work now. “When we look to the far reaches of where this technology might be applied or where it goes, I think it distracts from things that need to be addressed right now, like copyright law,” he said. “They’re not as exciting and interesting to talk about … but there’s an immediate impact on employment and compensation that needs to be dealt with.” Oppenheimer’s story also signals how difficult the path ahead will be to regulate artificial intelligence, according to Nolan. ChatGPT accelerated a race within top companies to develop and deploy AI systems, and policymakers around the world are in the early stages of catching up. In the U.S. Congress, lawmakers have   bipartisan legislation to address the technology, amid extensive lobbying from the tech industry. Oppenheimer largely failed in his efforts to address the risks of his invention. He was “crushed” in his efforts to prevent the development of the hydrogen bomb, Nolan said. The scientist’s efforts to work within the political system to create change largely failed, especially after his security clearance was revoked due to allegations that he had ties to communism. “I sympathize with people on the cutting edge of A.I. who will look at Oppenheimer’s story and seeing it as a cautionary tale, partly because I don’t think it offers many answers,” he said. In the postwar years, the atomic researchers were elevated in pop culture and reached fame scientists had never before seen in history, Nolan said. But ultimately, they found themselves excised from the political system. “When politicians need the inventors, they have a voice, and when they no longer need them, they have less of a voice,” Nolan said. “Oppenheimer’s story points to a lot of the difficulties, pitfalls around these kind of issues.” If inventors can’t ultimately decide how their technology is used, it bodes poorly for a host of tech executives, researchers and technologists who have invested significant time in educating Washington policymakers about artificial intelligence this year. , Tesla CEO  and top AI researchers from schools such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have spent hours testifying in hearings and speaking with lawmakers in closed-door meetings amid the new AI debate. The modern political environment presents new challenges, especially as the companies developing AI systems amass greater political influence in Washington. “I’m worried that our leaders in Washington have not yet managed to break free from the manipulations of the tech industry that consistently tell them that they don’t understand enough to regulate,” Nolan said. “We have to get past that mode immediately.” When Nolan began working on the movie about the 20th century scientist, he says he had no idea it would be so relevant to this year’s tech debate. He  during his “Oppenheimer” media blitz, and in November, he was  the Federation of American Scientists’ Public Service Award alongside policymakers working on artificial intelligence, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), Sen. Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) and Alondra Nelson, the former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. “Making a film about Oppenheimer, I never thought I would spend so much time talking about artificial intelligence,” Nolan said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/30/nolan-interview-ai-threats/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 07:00:00,
"The Supreme Court will be tested in the coming weeks to untangle politically consequential legal questions with the potential to reshape the 2024 presidential election. The court’s reputation remains marred by ethics controversies involving lavish travel and gifts, and public approval ratings remain low following high court rulings to overturn long-standing precedent. The Supreme Court will be tested in the coming weeks to untangle politically consequential legal questions with the potential to reshape the 2024 presidential election. The court’s reputation remains marred by ethics controversies involving lavish travel and gifts, and public approval ratings remain low following high court rulings to overturn long-standing precedent. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. did not address any of those contemporary issues Sunday in his annual “Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary.” Instead, he looked back on technological advancements in the nation’s court system, detailing developments from the quill pens used by justices in the 19th century to electronic databases of the 1980s to online trial proceedings prompted by the   pandemic. Roberts, a history buff, also expounded on the potential for artificial intelligence to both enhance and detract from the work of judges, lawyers and litigants. For those who cannot afford a lawyer, he noted, AI could increase access to justice. “AI obviously has great potential to dramatically increase access to key information for lawyers and non-lawyers alike. But just as it risks invading privacy interests and dehumanizing the law,” Roberts wrote, “machines cannot fully replace key actors in court.” Public  , reflecting a dip that followed its 2022 decision to overturn   and eliminate the nationwide right to abortion. The court has also faced immense public pressure and criticism following  funded by billionaire friends. Roberts also did not mention   the court’s adoption  , announced in November, specific to the nine justices and intended to promote “integrity and impartiality.” For years, the justices said they voluntarily complied with the same ethical guidelines that apply to other federal judges and resisted efforts by Congress to impose a policy on the high court. But the lack of a code became a persistent complaint from Capitol Hill that the justices were forced to address in 2023. In the weeks before the court’s announcement, several justices said publicly that it would be a good idea for the court to embrace its own plan rather than giving Congress an opening to pass a law. The policy was praised by some as a positive initial step, but criticized by legal ethics experts for giving the justices too much discretion over recusal decisions and for not including a process for holding the justices accountable if they violate their own rules. Still, Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a nonprofit group advocating for court transparency, called 2023 the “most important year for judicial ethics in decades.” It is “incumbent upon the justices in 2024 not simply to hope that questions surrounding their conduct die out — they won’t — but to make pronounced improvements in transparency and accountability,” he said in a statement before Roberts issued his report. “That’s especially true since the Court will be deciding such critical issues in the months to come, and it can’t afford to lose any more of the public’s trust.” Already, the justices have been   in December that former president Donald Trump’s name cannot appear on the state’s primary-election ballot because he engaged in insurrection on  , 2021. Maine officials have also barred Trump from the state’s primary ballot, putting pressure on the Supreme Court to settle the novel eligibility issue for all states. Separately, Trump’s claim that he can’t be prosecuted for trying to block Joe Biden’s 2020 victory because he is protected by presidential immunity is expected to make its way to the high court after review in January by an appeals court. The court’s 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices picked by Trump, but the former president does not have a winning track record at the high court. Some Democratic lawmakers have called on Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving Trump because of the efforts by his wife, Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, to challenge the 2020 election results. On top of the Trump-related election matters, the justices are contending this term with high-stakes cases involving guns, the power of federal agencies and the future of free speech online. The court has also agreed to decide this term whether to restrict access to a key medication used in more than half of U.S. abortions. Roberts used his year-end wrap-up, released by tradition on New Year’s Eve, in part to thank the court system’s technologists and cybersecurity experts. Those experts, he said, keep the judicial branch running behind-the-scenes and answer calls from judges, including Roberts, who said he has “been known to call on help desk staff for urgent and essential assistance.” Roberts did not mention that this time last year the court was finishing its   that eventually overturned a half-century of   rights. The court’s investigative report released last January did not determine the identity of the leaker. While the court’s IT experts did not rule out a hack, the report said there was no evidence to suggest improper access to the court’s IT networks. In reflecting Sunday on technological advancements in the federal court system, Roberts noted that the legal profession is notoriously averse to change. He emphasized that human judgment will still be required for legal determinations that often involve gray areas. Judges and especially Supreme Court justices face novel, open questions about how the law should develop in new areas — something AI can inform, but not decide, Roberts said. “Some may wonder whether judges are about to become obsolete,” he wrote. “I am sure we are not — but equally confident that technological changes will continue to transform our work.” Chief Justice John G.

There, in the dark darkness and near-emptiness, teetered a neighboring car, the left half of it still clinging to solid ground but the right half hovering as if the whole machine looked ripe to topple right on into … … that bunker. That golf bunker. There are hellish bunker escapes, and then there are hellish bunker escapes. A tow truck stood dutifully nearby. The thing is, this screwball sight qualifies as an extreme that happens from time to time and backlights a uniqueness. Perhaps the nation’s most venerable stadium, its majestic, low-slung self, stands in an arroyo next door to city-owned Brookside Golf Club, its neighbor with two 18-hole courses and a paucity of wind. And on Monday, the courses will buttress its annual 40,000 or so cars, these latest ones carrying those interested in witnessing No. 1 Michigan vs. No. 4 Alabama in a Rose Bowl national semifinal. Most of those 40,000 will come and go without complication, but some will wander through the winter darkness into the kinds of graphic circumstances that fasten themselves to human memory banks. Their drivers will try shortcutting and drive smack into a bunker. “It happens quite often,” Brookside tournament coordinator Philip Di Nova said. “We’ve had that, and we’ve had people drive their cars into the lakes.” So: “If you’re not careful and you don’t follow the painted lines [to exit the lot], you will end up in a precarious situation. It will take a couple of great shots to get out of that bunker.” Then there’s that other category: “Tuesday after the Rose Bowl, we’ll have probably half a dozen cars that are left behind.” That means the sunrise golfers of Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2024, might play through a stray car here or there, a situation both irksome and preferable to the alternative of these people having driven home. More often, Di Nova said, golfers won’t even notice anything odder than stuffed trash bags, owing to the brisk, yeoman work of cleanup crews. “They do such a good job,” Di Nova said, “that if you’re here the day after, two days after, other than the tire tracks you would not know that there were that many cars.” Now and then, tiny hazards turn up. “They open [the course] right up,” said Dennis Kuromi, who lives five miles away and has played Brookside for at least 30 years. “And [the football fans] do that ‘picnicking’ ” — he paused — “or ‘tailgating.’ So you see remnants, a lot of bottle caps.” If someone happens to have driven over, say, a green, it’s dumb but not dire. Help with fertilization and restoration comes from within the contracts of those wishing to stage Rose Bowl events. The money for the club is, well, good. Of course, there was that time maybe 10 years ago when a golf cart went missing until it was spotted on the nearby 210 freeway with a nouveau driver. “So someone had taken some golf cart and just decided to go home,” said Tege Sauer, who has traveled down from Portland, Ore., for the past 15 Decembers to spend the weeks of Rose Bowl run-up organizing massive tailgate events for Levy, the food and beverage company. On Friday, she walked beside the fairway of Course No. 1, hole No. 18, coordinating with others — the company bringing tables and tents, the company setting up merchandise stands — toward a two-event bonanza for a combined 5,600 Michigan alumni. Her phone boasts a photo of the maize-and-blue doughnuts Krispy Kreme will concoct. “I get to watch it all unfold,” she said. That includes some telltale juxtapositions, such as a Rose Bowl merchandise stand budding alongside a green full of golfers practicing chipping and putting. Most of the time, Brookside would be a thriving facility in a thriving ecosystem, still feeling lingering swells from the great pandemic golf wave. There’s a grip-and-rip 6,711-yard course (C.W. Koiner Course No. 1) and a more finicky 6,025-yard course (E.O. Nay Course No. 2) with narrower fairways and “the greens harder, smaller, more undulating,” Kuromi said. There’s 12-month bustle around: runners, walkers, cyclists and dog-ushers on the 5K course that rings the Rose Bowl area. With its Southern California Golf Association events and fundraisers and all, Brookside hosts 200-odd tournaments per year, Di Nova said. They play adjacent to a stadium that never has hovered or loomed, a stadium so unassuming in its beauty that a first-timer in pre-GPS days might have wandered nearby roads wondering,   There’s less wind and rain than in nearby cities and towns because the San Gabriel Mountains provide cover. There’s not much elevation on the course, making it friendlier to old or sore legs. “We’re a very walkable course,” Di Nova said. Coyotes abound but don’t tend to bother anyone except maybe that goose they just ate, the feathers obvious. Birds swoop down on occasion to grab squirrels or rabbits. Bobcats might whisk by but only in transit to somewhere else. A visitor on the Friday morning before a Rose Bowl might notice a coyote milling around on the ridge just above Rose Bowl Road because, of course. All of this thrums next to American football tussles such as the Rose Bowl or UCLA home games, international futbol matches such as the World Cup finals of 1994 (men) and 1999 (women) or concerts, and it’s far from the dreary gray parking-lot setting of many a stadium, not just that of Jerry Jones. It’s also an evocative place to play golf. “For a good 20 to 30 percent of golfers on weekends,” Di Nova said, “it enhances their enjoyment of playing here because of the historic Rose Bowl. They’re in the shadow of the ‘granddaddy of them all,’ the Keith Jackson line.” “I don’t even think about it,” Kuromi said, “because I’ve lived here all my life.” “When you are on No. 9” on Course No. 1, the hole that most hugs the stadium, Reymond Maranan said, “when I was beginning, I have lots of ‘donations’ of golf balls onto the stadium premises.” Maranan, who moved from the Philippines to Pasadena in 2012, finished some putts Friday, waited for his tee time and talked about how he used to disrespect golf as a high-level baseball player because the ball you must hit does not happen to be moving beforehand. He played baseball for years as a shortstop and right-handed pitcher who “can confidently say that I am the Shohei Ohtani of my [Filipino] state [Batanagas] because I’m a pitcher and a cleanup hitter.” He found golf only when the pandemic wouldn’t allow for anything else, and now he’s “addicted,” happy with his club speed, teaching in the First Tee program for children and spending about three days a week in the shadow of a legend. “They call it ‘the granddaddy of them all,’ ” he said. They do, and as Sauer said, “It’s so fun [to play the courses] but hard to not think of it as, ‘Oh, this would be a great spot for a tailgate.’ ” As she spoke upon the driving range, forklifts brought supplies. A truck dragged in portable restrooms. Fences went up, and massive tents began doing same. Those who care about the course started to get that familiar little cringe, a “love-hate thing” rooted in this thought Di Nova shared: “You want it pristine, and you want it to look great at all times.” He joked to Sauer in the golf shop, “Saw you out there ready to mess up our course.” She laughed because this rare setting has become a treasured part of her life as well: a cheery golf club next to a revered football game after which a driver (or two) might reach a bunker.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/rose-bowl-cfp-golf-course/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 05:00:00,
"A dramatic clear-out and reshuffle of the Chinese military’s top brass escalated this week when the ruling Communist Party dismissed high-ranking officers and appointed a naval commander as defense minister four months after his predecessor disappeared amid a sweeping corruption crackdown. A year into his third term,  , China’s most powerful leader in decades, is attempting — once again — to curb deep-rooted graft that threatens his ambition of turning the People’s Liberation Army into a “world-class” fighting force able to go toe-to-toe with the United States. A dramatic clear-out and reshuffle of the Chinese military’s top brass escalated this week when the ruling Communist Party dismissed high-ranking officers and appointed a naval commander as defense minister four months after his predecessor disappeared amid a sweeping corruption crackdown. A year into his third term,  , China’s most powerful leader in decades, is attempting — once again — to curb deep-rooted graft that threatens his ambition of turning the People’s Liberation Army into a “world-class” fighting force able to go toe-to-toe with the United States. The promotion Friday of Admiral Dong Jun, the 62-year-old former head of the Chinese navy, came alongside announcements that a dozen generals and senior executives from state-run military enterprises had been removed from the country’s legislature and top political advisory body. The scale of this week’s personnel changes, announced at meetings of senior Chinese Communist Party officials in Beijing, hinted at the severity of the ongoing probe into military corruption that in recent months has targeted weapons procurement and the rocket force in charge of the country’s missile and nuclear arsenals. China did not say why the previous defense minister, Li Shangfu, was   after being absent from public view for two months. But U.S. officials say Li probably was   into bid rigging and lax oversight during the five years he was in charge of the Equipment Development Department, which is tasked with improving China’s military technology. High-ranking officials overseeing the rocket force that manages China’s nuclear arsenal were also   in August. Of the nine senior military officials who were kicked out of the National People’s Congress on Friday, all appeared to have direct or indirect connections to Li. Some had worked in the Equipment Development Department under Li from 2017 to 2022; others were in the rocket force or space program. “Something major must have occurred to precipitate this kind of purge,” most likely a major corruption scandal or intel leak, Lyle Morris, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute,   on X, formerly Twitter. Experts on the Chinese military say that the reshuffle and Dong’s appointment are unlikely to significantly alter China’s ambitious military modernization program or its approach toward relations with the United States. In China, the position of defense minister is largely ceremonial and mainly focused on military diplomacy and international engagement. High-level strategy and major decisions instead come from top-ranking members of the Central Military Commission, which is chaired by Xi. Unlike his predecessor, Dong is not yet a member of the commission. The unusual choice of a naval officer fits with a long-running shift toward prioritizing maritime power, which China sees as essential to achieving military supremacy in the Indo-Pacific and asserting its sovereignty claims over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing considers its territory. Dong, who has spent his entire career in the navy, has experience commanding the rapidly expanding fleets China uses to back up contested claims in the South and East China seas. He has also been involved in joint naval drills with Russia, which China sees as an important partner in its efforts to dominate the region. Military analysts say they expect Dong, as the new public face of the People’s Liberation Army, to push ahead with the recent renewal of military-to-military dialogue between China and the United States, which was agreed on when   in November. But the fundamentals of the relationship are unlikely to significantly change, and promotions within the navy suggest China is increasingly focused on the South China Sea as an arena of military competition with the United States and its allies, the Eurasia Group wrote in a research note. Efforts to soothe tensions remain precarious and could easily be derailed if China’s aggressive military tactics spark a fresh round of hostilities, analysts warn. Achieving a reset in ties has been complicated by Beijing’s tense   with the Philippines over contested islands, escalating  , and frequent   by Chinese ships and warplanes targeting the United States and its allies.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/30/china-defense-minister-xi-military/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 10:54:00,
"ELMONT, N.Y — The trouble started for the Washington Capitals on the second shot of the game. Ninety seconds into Friday’s matchup with the New York Islanders at UBS Arena, Islanders forward Brock Nelson fired a wrist shot that forced Washington goaltender Charlie Lindgren to make an awkward save, squeezing the puck between his glove and his blocker against his left shoulder. The officials had a short conversation with Lindgren, who appeared to stretch his back over the crossbar before the next faceoff, and Lindgren stayed in the game. ELMONT, N.Y — The trouble started for the Washington Capitals on the second shot of the game. Ninety seconds into Friday’s matchup with the New York Islanders at UBS Arena, Islanders forward Brock Nelson fired a wrist shot that forced Washington goaltender Charlie Lindgren to make an awkward save, squeezing the puck between his glove and his blocker against his left shoulder. The officials had a short conversation with Lindgren, who appeared to stretch his back over the crossbar before the next faceoff, and Lindgren stayed in the game. He didn’t last long, however. About five minutes later, Darcy Kuemper donned his mask on the bench and Lindgren exited after playing just 6:46. At the same time, defenseman Martin Fehervary also left the game after crashing into the boards behind Washington’s net; both players were ruled out with upper-body injuries during the first intermission. Suddenly without their expected starting goalie and one of their best defenders, the Capitals saw the game quickly turn on them and went on to lose, 5-1. Kuemper stopped 24 of the 29 shots he faced in relief of the injured Lindgren. “Definitely put us in a hole right away,” Washington Coach Spencer Carbery said. “Goaltender’s always a unique one, but you sort of feel like you can get out of that. Losing a D early is tough because now you go down to five so early, second shift of the game. And then you get some guys that are taxed real early in that game, which puts us in a tough spot.” Carbery said that he didn’t know the severity of either injury but that both Lindgren and Fehervary will be out “at least for the foreseeable future.” The Capitals escaped the first period unscathed, even as the Islanders built significant momentum, but New York scored two goals just 1:10 apart early in the second period, and the Capitals dug themselves only deeper into the hole as the game went on. The Islanders picked the Capitals apart on the rush, taking advantage of turnovers and poor defensive zone coverage to strike seemingly at will in transition. Two mistakes led to the two second-period goals, and as Washington desperately tried to create offense while chasing the game, the Capitals opened up defensively — openings New York exploited. On the Islanders’ first goal, Evgeny Kuznetsov’s line had New York hemmed into the defensive zone and was cycling the puck around. But when defenseman Rasmus Sandin turned the puck over while pinching down the wall, the Islanders stepped up into a four-on-two rush the other way. Jean-Gabriel Pageau slid into the left faceoff circle unmarked and received a seam pass from Alexander Romanov that he blasted into the upper corner of the net. “It’s hard to sum up a game like that in one play, but that sequence in the offensive zone, it’s so emblematic of — I feel like I’ve said this a bunch this year, where things look really good for our group offensively,” Carbery said. “It looks like there’s some movement, and then Sandy turns it over, and the next thing you know you’re down 1-0. You go from such a positive situation to now being down 1-0, and like I’ve said before, that becomes then challenging. Then the second one, and now you’re really in a hole.” Just over a minute after Pageau scored, Mathew Barzal carried the puck into the offensive zone and dropped a no-look pass to Noah Dobson, who fired a one-timer over Kuemper’s glove before center Dylan Strome could close him down. To the extent that the Capitals found their footing in a game in which they were outshot 32-27, took 51 shot attempts to the Islanders’ 71 and mustered just one goal in the dying seconds, they found it after the Islanders went up 2-0. But their fleeting offensive zone sequences weren’t enough to generate a goal, and even a power play shortly after Dobson’s goal didn’t provide any help. The man advantage ended with Sandin taking a hooking penalty after the Islanders flew up the ice on a two-on-one shorthanded rush. Carbery shook up Washington’s lines after a 5-1 loss to the New York Rangers on Wednesday, but the new-look combinations didn’t solve the Capitals’ offensive problems. “Last couple games, it hasn’t been good enough offensively, obviously,” winger Tom Wilson said. “You’ve got to kind of work through it. It’s one of those things that you’ve just got to put your head down, work for each other, try and get open when the guy with the puck is looking for a play, that sort of thing. It’s not good enough.” Julian Gauthier’s two goals 18 seconds apart in the third period would have been the final daggers for the Capitals if not for Pageau scoring his second of the night with 5:34 left to play. Nicolas Aube-Kubel broke up Ilya Sorokin’s bid for a shutout with 18 seconds left, which drew groans from the crowd but was of little comfort to Washington after a second consecutive ugly loss. “We have way more skill than we’re showing,” defenseman John Carlson said. “... We’re not executing at a high enough level to consistently get the amount of good looks that we need to beat good goalies in this league.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/capitals-islanders-lindgren-fehervary-injury/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 23:21:00,

"Spencer Carbery is, by nature, an enthusiastic person. Whether the Washington Capitals coach is teaching concepts to his players, calling out instructions during a game or discussing his thoughts with the media, Carbery’s intensity and sheer passion for his job are always on display. But if you want to  get Carbery excited, ask him about the NFL. Spencer Carbery is, by nature, an enthusiastic person. Whether the Washington Capitals coach is teaching concepts to his players, calling out instructions during a game or discussing his thoughts with the media, Carbery’s intensity and sheer passion for his job are always on display. But if you want to  get Carbery excited, ask him about the NFL. Despite growing up in Victoria, B.C., surrounded by Seattle Seahawks fans, Carbery is a lifelong fan of the San Francisco 49ers. And as Carbery has gone on his own   in hockey, his fascination with football has extended to its coaches — most prominently Kyle Shanahan, who just so happens to be the coach of Carbery’s 49ers, and the growing branches of Shanahan’s coaching tree. In fact, in the rare moments that he’s not at the Capitals’ practice facility, Carbery can often be found watching HBO’s “Hard Knocks” — which this season features a coach connected to Shanahan. “I follow it closely and am fascinated with the inner workings of how they operate,” Carbery said Thursday. “Their day-to-day, their meetings, their training camps, their preparation each week. … I’ve been watching — [Miami Dolphins Coach] Mike McDaniel is a disciple of Kyle and worked in San Fran, and they’ve been on ‘Hard Knocks.’ I’m almost caught up with that. I love watching that stuff.” When the Capitals were in California in November, Carbery and his coaching staff toured the 49ers’ practice facility. It was a day off for San Francisco, so no one was in the building, but Carbery still grinned as he recalled the experience a month later. Much to Carbery’s delight, the NFL and NHL schedules came together to land the 49ers at FedEx Field to face the Washington Commanders on Sunday, a day off for the Capitals. For Carbery’s 42nd birthday in November, his wife, Casey, secured tickets to the game as well as access to the sideline, putting Carbery up close with his favorite football team for the first time. “From an early age, from Joe [Montana] and Jerry [Rice], they were always my favorite team,” Carbery said. “My family would give me a hard time, because the Seahawks and the 49ers, that’s such a huge rivalry. That’s how it started. I always followed them ever since. I think this will be the first time I’ve seen them live.” Carbery was equally thrilled at the chance to watch how Shanahan operates. As the youngest coach in the NHL, Carbery identifies closely with Shanahan, 44, who was just 37 when he was hired to coach the 49ers. Other young coaches, such as the Los Angeles Rams’ Sean McVay and the Green Bay Packers’ Matt LaFleur, have also captured Carbery’s attention, but Shanahan is at the top of the list. While the demographics of NHL coaching have changed in recent years, with more and more coaches taking the reins despite limited — or no — professional playing experience, the perception for decades was that the opposite was a prerequisite to be an NHL coach. Carbery played four seasons in minor pro leagues, several tiers below the NHL, so part of his gravitation toward Shanahan is that Shanahan, too, didn’t play at the level that he now coaches. Shanahan is considered one of the NFL’s best play callers, and this season the 49ers’ offense leads the league in a variety of metrics, including explosive play rate and expected points added per play, a metric used to quantify a given play’s impact on the outcome of a game. “In my opinion — I’m a little bit biased, and they have great players — but the different things he does from a play-calling standpoint I think is really, really impressive,” Carbery said. “It’s not just in San Francisco. I have a lot of respect for the way that he, number one, having not played in the NFL, being a younger guy, proved what he’s capable of doing. And then two, to be so cutting-edge and on the forefront of, how do we create more offense? How do I create advantages? He has been really impressive on that.” There are, of course, inherent differences between the way offense works in the two sports. In the NFL, where every play begins from a standstill, a coach has an almost unlimited ability to design a play and be creative. Set plays off faceoffs are commonplace in the NHL, and teams often have specific sequences they look for within the flow of the game, but there’s naturally less control over individual plays in a free-flowing sport such as hockey. But that doesn’t stop Carbery from looking to Shanahan, McDaniel, McVay and LaFleur for inspiration. Philosophically, Carbery is intrigued by the way Shanahan and his peers have pushed the envelope to create some of the best offenses in the NFL. “What those guys always did is they were so pushing each other to find the next new idea,” Carbery said earlier this season. “That, to me, is what it’s about. It’s not necessarily about the actual X’s and O’s of it. It’s like, what’s going to be the next thing? What can you do on the power play? How are you going to score more? That’s where I think they’ve been, and Kyle especially, [geniuses] at figuring out ways to create motion and more points.” And when Carbery looks at how the NFL has changed, it brings him back to his own league, which is starting to go down a similar path. “The NFL, I find, is always very ahead of the curve of what’s next in sports because of the money at stake and all that,” Carbery said. “You look at the NHL to follow suit. Scoring is up; it’s the highest it’s ever been. Power plays are scoring at the highest rate. That drives money. Protect your stars, make sure they’re playing. Rule changes in the NHL, less clutching and grabbing. … To me, it follows in suit with what the NFL knew.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/pro-hockey-coach-nfl/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 05:31:00,
"The Washington Capitals have spent most of this season playing with a fine margin for error. Heading into Saturday night’s game at Capital One Arena, Washington had been to overtime or a shootout 11 times in 33 games — and had played 16 games decided by a single goal. It was fitting, then, that not only did the Capitals go to a shootout against the Nashville Predators in a 3-2 loss but that their would-be game-winner late in regulation was wiped away by the finest of margins. The Washington Capitals have spent most of this season playing with a fine margin for error. Heading into Saturday night’s game at Capital One Arena, Washington had been to overtime or a shootout 11 times in 33 games — and had played 16 games decided by a single goal. It was fitting, then, that not only did the Capitals go to a shootout against the Nashville Predators in a 3-2 loss but that their would-be game-winner late in regulation was wiped away by the finest of margins. After mustering just two goals in their previous two games while allowing 10, the Capitals entered their final game of 2023 desperate for a bounce-back. Though they gave up the first two goals to the Predators, digging a hole similar to the one they found themselves  , Washington responded to tie the score by the end of the second period. And with just under a minute left in regulation, captain Alex Ovechkin fired a wrist shot that would have been his second goal of the game and could have been the deciding tally. Officially, the puck was ruled to have crossed the goal line at 59.5 seconds, meaning any challenge had to be initiated by the NHL’s situation room in Toronto. The goal was reviewed for goaltender interference by center Nic Dowd, and it was judged that Dowd had made contact with Nashville goaltender Yaroslav Askarov before the goal. “Would’ve liked that to have counted,” Capitals Coach Spencer Carbery said. “My opinion on it, I would’ve — from going through tons of reviews, doing a study on it, a project, my personal take is there’s not enough there to overturn. Especially to overturn because that’s where it gets tricky. When it’s called a goal on the ice, it needs to be very, very evident to overturn it. That’s the way that it’s been described to us from the league. In that situation, given that, is there enough there? It’s tight.” When the Capitals looked at the goal, their clock showed that the puck crossed the line with just a few milliseconds more than a minute remaining in the game — meaning that a challenge would have been up to the Predators if the clock had stopped then. The goal came on a delayed penalty against Nashville, so if Predators Coach Andrew Brunette had chosen to challenge the goal and been wrong, Nashville would have faced a five-on-three penalty kill in the final minute. “It goes in at 1:00.8 or something,” Carbery said. “So if it stops, technically, when the puck goes in the net, if the scorer — then they can’t review it in Toronto unless it gets challenged.” If the Capitals hadn’t dug themselves a two-goal hole in the first seven minutes, though, the fine margin at the bitter end may not have been the deciding factor. The first period began the way the previous game ended — with the Capitals’ opponent in control. Luke Evangelista took advantage of a rebound in the slot less than three minutes in, scoring from his knees to give Nashville an early lead. The Predators (20-16-1) doubled their advantage just over four minutes later with a power-play goal by defenseman Roman Josi, and Washington seemed to be reeling. At that point, 6:55 in, Nashville had 10 shots on goal to the Capitals’ three. But winger Beck Malenstyn’s goal at 10:25 gave Washington (17-11-6) a lifeline. Coming down the slot, Dowd fired a shot that Askarov (27 saves) kicked out — directly to Malenstyn at the back door for a tap-in finish into a wide-open net. “I thought probably the start was not good,” Carbery said. “We get behind the eight ball. And then that middle portion, I really liked a lot of the things that we did sort of once we got down 2-0.” The Capitals came out for the second period in step with Nashville rather than trailing as they had for much of the first. Washington went on the power play at 12:56 of the second when Evangelista was boxed for holding, but the power play gave more momentum to the Predators’ penalty kill than it did to Washington. As the power play’s final seconds ticked down, center Connor McMichael entered the offensive zone with speed for one last try. He dished the puck to forward Aliaksei Protas, who found center Dylan Strome at the top of the right circle. Strome spotted Ovechkin in the left circle for a trademark one-timer — and this time, Ovechkin stepped into a full-strength blast that beat Askarov. Ovechkin’s shot tied the score with 5:01 left in the second and made Askarov the 171st goalie he has scored on in NHL his career. Nashville pushed back after Ovechkin scored, and the Capitals needed a few near-miracle saves by Hunter Shepard (34 saves) to keep the score level heading into the second intermission. With 3:16 left in the period, Shepard robbed Tommy Novak from point-blank range, leaving the Predators stunned. .  ROBBERY!!!!!!!!  With both teams playing on the second night of a back-to-back, their fatigue was evident in the third period. The pace slowed, but Askarov and Shepard held strong to make the necessary saves and keep the score at 2-2. After Ovechkin’s goal was waved off, the Capitals went on the power play for the final minute of regulation and the beginning of overtime but couldn’t capitalize. The Predators pushed the puck — and Shepard — into the net with 1:02 left, but the goal was immediately waved off. In the shootout, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Ovechkin were stopped, but Gustav Nyquist and Ryan O’Reilly scored for Nashville to end it, sending the Capitals into 2024 on a four-game skid. “It’s obviously frustrating,” Malenstyn said. “You want those to go in. You’re celebrating, you feel like you’ve got it, and it gets swiped away from you. But their job is to make those decisions, and you don’t always have to agree with them. I thought it was a pretty good effort from the group overall.” Shepard made his third start of the season after being called up from Washington’s American Hockey League affiliate, the Hershey Bears, on Saturday afternoon. To clear the roster spot needed to call up Shepard in the wake of goaltender Charlie Lindgren suffering an upper-body injury Friday, the Capitals assigned forward Ivan Miroshnichenko to Hershey. Carbery had said Friday that Lindgren would be out “for the foreseeable future,” but before Saturday’s game he said Washington had gotten positive news, indicating that Lindgren’s injury may not be as severe as feared.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/capitals-predators-shootout-losing-streak/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 23:28:00,

Rodemaker would have been healthy for an attractive Orange Bowl matchup with Georgia — except, like Texas quarterback Maalik Murphy, he decided to transfer, too. College football’s offseason comes when its season is still decidedly  , with players’ newfound — and justified — free agency occurring while practices are ongoing and bowl games fill the TV lineup. The sport’s leaders — that term is, of course, used loosely — have chosen chaos over order. The result is confusion. Lane Kiffin, you coach Mississippi, and you have spent the week trying to get your team ready to face Penn State in the Peach Bowl. Take it away. “It’s a terrible system,” Kiffin told reporters in Atlanta leading up to Saturday’s game. “ … I wouldn’t think any other sports, professional sports, have ever set up a system where free agency starts while the season is still going. “So it really makes no sense. You can leave. You can stay. You can go other places. Coaches can call you — and our season is still going. It would be like before the NFC or AFC playoffs start in a couple weeks, all of a sudden, ‘Hey, free agency, the week before, opens!' ’’ There’s a lot going on here and not much that makes sense. Let’s be clear from the jump: College athletes should have the right to transfer without penalty — the old sit-out-a-year-rule was garbage — just like any other college student can transfer without consequences. The athletes produce the product. The athletes should have rights. The athletes aren’t the problem. What has resulted, though, are several red-letter days on the college football calendar that are completely out of order. It’s as if the sport’s alphabet starts E-B-A-C-D. First comes the opening of the transfer window — this year, Dec. 4. That’s two days after the conclusion of the conference championship games and one day after the CFP selection committee makes its choices. Players can transfer through Jan. 2 — which happens to be the day after the CFP semis. Oh, and in the middle of it comes early signing day Dec. 20. All incoming freshmen have to warily watch the players in the transfer portal, while those potential transfers cast a suspicious eye right back. Even if coaches aren’t making official depth charts, players and their parents are. It’s a puzzle figuring out where a kid might have the best opportunity to play, except the pieces never stop moving. So consider Murphy’s predicament: If Ewers got hurt against Washington, he might be thrust into action —   action — on the sport’s biggest stage. But if he’s thinking about his career — and he is, understandably — he knows Ewers may return to Texas for what would be his third season in 2024. He also knows former No. 1 recruit Arch Manning — yes, of   Mannings — replaced Ewers in a late-season blowout win over Texas Tech while Murphy watched from the sideline. Murphy wants real playing time as a college quarterback. His options this month: Stick around through the playoffs and maybe watch the Longhorns win a national title — and even help them do it. Or he could leave, either now or later. There’s another transfer window in April, by which point Murphy still might be behind Ewers and Manning. Wait and transfer then, and he would have lost a semester of workouts with a new school. So last week, Murphy announced he would transfer to Duke — and the Longhorns’ practices and preparations for the program’s biggest game since it played for the national title following the 2009 season are changed because of it. The problem here isn’t that there’s an early signing period. The problem is that it coincides with a period in which there has been unprecedented player movement, a trend that doesn’t figure to stop. Can’t they somehow be separated? This system was created in 2017 so players could graduate early from high school and enroll in college in January — thus giving them an offseason in a high-level strength program as well as an extra spring practice session. But that was   players were allowed to transfer without sitting out a season, which means it was before the transfer portal was jammed like rush hour on a Los Angeles freeway. So the NCAA works thusly: One rule is put in place because it makes sense at that moment, but when another rule is adopted to address a separate issue, it’s done piecemeal. There is no one stepping back and holistically asking, “Does the big picture make sense?” Oh, and another thing: Because transfers have become so central to most programs, it’s possible — even probable — the teams that reached the playoff following the 2023 season will be compromised in 2024. Michigan, for instance, will either have J.J. McCarthy back for his senior season as the Wolverines’ quarterback — or McCarthy will leave for the NFL. “I’m completely in the present moment,” McCarthy said last week in not addressing his intentions. With a national title at stake, good for him. But that uncertainty means the bevy of quarterbacks in the transfer portal can’t really consider Michigan. Indeed, according to rankings of transferring players compiled by  , only three of the top 25 transfers nationwide are headed to the four playoff teams. That’s one fewer than will land at Ole Miss, whose coach is benefiting from what he calls “a really bad system.” One final element: the bowl games. These sideshows long ago transformed from being rewards for a well-played season to holiday programming for the TV networks. To that end, they still work well, because who doesn’t like stumbling into an entertaining game to divert attention from loved ones? (Don’t answer that.) But what are we even watching? Between outgoing transfers and players opting out of playing to protect their health in preparation for the NFL draft, the depth charts in many bowl games are virtually unrecognizable. North Carolina played the Duke’s Mayo Bowl without quarterback Drake Maye and leading receiver Tez Walker — and got pummeled by West Virginia, 30-10. Southern California played the Holiday Bowl without 2022 Heisman Trophy winner and presumed No. 1 draft pick Caleb Williams — and redshirt sophomore Miller Moss threw for six touchdowns. Oklahoma played the Alamo Bowl without transferring quarterback Dillon Gabriel. Oregon State and Notre Dame might have provided a good quarterback matchup in the Sun Bowl, but neither the Beavers’ DJ Uiagalelei (transfer) nor the Irish’s Sam Hartman (draft prep) suited up. Texas A&M was down 31 players and using a fourth-string quarterback in its Texas Bowl loss to Oklahoma State. The list — Ohio State quarterback Kyle McCord, Maryland quarterback Taulia Tagovailoa, etc., etc., ad infinitum — is longer. And it leaves the non-playoff bowl games with a spring game feel. The games can be competitive and compelling, but they don’t really relate to the season just past. College football has long been chasing the problems that dog it rather than seeing what’s coming and getting out ahead. Next year, throw the expanded, 12-team College Football Playoff into the mix. The dates for four first-round games: Dec. 20-21 — happen to align with this year’s early-signing period.

"Taina Fernandez made quick work of the Girls Beast of the East tournament, and her dominance at the national showcase in Newark, Del., shouldn’t come as a surprise. Ranked by USA Wrestling as the top 130-pound girls’ wrestler in the nation — second overall in her class — the Archbishop Spalding freshman also has worn the 62-kilogram crown at the under-15 Pan American Championships this year. Taina Fernandez made quick work of the Girls Beast of the East tournament, and her dominance at the national showcase in Newark, Del., shouldn’t come as a surprise. Ranked by USA Wrestling as the top 130-pound girls’ wrestler in the nation — second overall in her class — the Archbishop Spalding freshman also has worn the 62-kilogram crown at the under-15 Pan American Championships this year. When she stepped onto the mat Friday at the University of Delaware, Fernandez’s ability was immediately evident. She blitzed the field by winning four bouts, culminating with the first-place match — her third of the day by fall. “Honestly, it was a pretty awesome experience,” said Fernandez, who tried to participate in last year’s event but was deemed too young. “I was very thankful for the opportunity to compete.” Fernandez is the first girl Spalding’s Michael Laidley has coached, but she instantaneously assimilated into the squad. Her teammates, some of whom were already familiar from junior league competition, cheered her on to victory. “I’m just thankful to have support from my coaches,” Fernandez said. “[Laidley] doesn’t treat me like a girls’ wrestler — he treats me just like another guy on the team, and that’s awesome. And I’m thankful to have my teammates always supporting me.” Two days before the showcase in Delaware, Spalding hosted its first dual meet of the season. Fernandez, not yet a usual starter but frequently pushing high-level partners in training, needed just 44 seconds to pin her opponent. “We have juniors and great sophomores and a couple of seniors, but in time she will be one of those leaders,” Laidley said. “It’s just going to happen because of what she does in the room.” Coach Nathaniel Metts uses McKinley Tech’s 2018 boys’ outdoor track and field team as motivation for his current indoor squad. The Trainers consistently notched second-place finishes at D.C. Interscholastic Athletic Association indoor and outdoor championships in the mid-2010s but usually finished well behind Wilson. That changed in 2018, when the McKinley boys’ outdoor squad finished even on points with the Tigers and claimed the school’s first boys’ track title since 1978. “I always bring up my 2018 boys’ team, like, ‘Oh, those guys are great; what do you guys want to do?’ ” Metts said. “They get upset in a playful way, and they always say: ‘You keep talking about the 2018 team like they’re better than us. We’ll show you.’ ” Metts’s current group might deserve similar reverence. While the Trainers’ 2018 team made the initial breakthrough, McKinley is now accustomed to winning. The Trainers have claimed three consecutive DCIAA boys’ track and field titles, including last season’s   and   championships. Powered by athletes such as Cornell signee Ayotunde Ejiko, who won outdoor state titles in the 100, 200 and 400 meters in May, this year’s McKinley team hopes to repeat as DCIAA champion and make a breakthrough of its own by improving on a pair of fourth-place finishes at last season’s indoor and outdoor D.C. State Athletic Association championships. “They’re motivated to get out of that fourth place. They felt like fourth place wasn’t them as a team,” said Metts, whose boys’ team returns 26 athletes from last season. “They feel like they got to come back and redo it, so they’re definitely gunning for one of those top-three places.” Jordan Ignacio has been immersed in gymnastics since she was 3 years old. She followed her older sister, Emily, during meets, emulating her movements as best as she could for a toddler. Jordan started practicing on beam as soon as she could walk and balance long enough. Fourteen years later, the Ignacio sisters are leading Battlefield as it aims to improve on last year’s second-place showing in the state final — Jordan as a senior and Emily as co-head coach. “I know that they have it in their heads that they want to get back to states,” said Emily Ignacio, who’s in her fourth season with Battlefield. Battlefield was the   at last year’s Virginia Class 6 state meet. Jordan Ignacio’s 10.0 on beam and individual title on floor weren’t enough. She is her squad’s anchor again this season. Battlefield has finished first in its three meets this season and feels more confident as it looks to dethrone the Bruins. But a new obstacle might make its path more difficult. Mountain View, the Class 5 champion last season, moved up to Class 6. “States is always the goal,” Jordan Ignacio said. “[Last year] it was a little bit more of a surprise than this year.” Nate Decker has been on a path to swim collegiately since he started training at age 8. The Broadneck senior committed to Utah, with schools such as LSU and Navy pursuing him. But despite being highly regarded in the backstroke and freestyle, Decker has long struggled with the underwater portion of swimming. Between flip turns and flutter kicks after diving into the pool, Decker lost ground while underwater. This year, he embarked on an intense offseason program, combining land workouts with pool-based conditioning to build strength and perfect the key seconds when he is submerged. Part of the struggles, Decker said, came from playing water polo before he focused solely on swimming. “[Underwater training] wasn’t a main focus when I was younger; it was more about getting my strokes down,” he said. Decker won the 200-yard freestyle (1 minute 47.65 seconds) and the 100-yard backstroke (54.28) at Friday’s conference meet against Old Mill and Chesapeake. Decker and his teammates also won the 200-yard medley relay and the 400-yard freestyle relay. Broadneck is historically a strong program, but Coach Colleen Winans said the talent on this year’s team is hard to top. Still, young swimmers have had to step up because of conflicting club swim schedules for some of the top competitors. Decker is the leader, even if it means teammates have to deal with an unusual playlist blasting from his phone. “Personally, I like pop, which is funny because not a lot of people do,” he said. Before St. John’s meets its top rivals in league matchups later this season, the Cadets scheduled exhibition games to get their new players ready for that sort of pressure. One of those early tests came against Landon on Friday, a game that coincided with the team’s Hockey Fights Cancer fundraising initiative. “There were a lot of people not even connected to the school that were there, so I was surprised everybody fit on the rink at once,” junior forward Carter Johnson said. “It was awesome. It was cool to see all the buzz around campus about people going to the game.” Knowing the Landon game — a preview of a late-season Mid-Atlantic Prep Hockey League matchup — would be an early opportunity to draw a crowd and attention to two of the region’s best squads, the Cadets used it as a way to raise money for cancer research. Each player had a goal of raising $1,000, and the team hosted bake sales and sold T-shirts to raise more than $17,000 total. Despite all the hype, the game delivered, too. The Cadets came out strong in the first few minutes with a goal by senior Kelly Thompson. Landon responded with a goal of its own. The 1-1 tie held to the final whistle, leaving both teams eager for the rematch Feb. 9, when the stakes will be higher. “It was a very fun event, and hopefully it becomes a tradition,” Johnson said. “… [It’s also a chance to] just kind of get a sense of what all the other teams are like — all their weaknesses and stuff like that.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/19/spalding-freshman-wrestler-proves-shes-beast-mckinley-tech-track-has-vintage-squad/,Washington Post,2023-12-19 10:00:00,
"Bowl season is winding down, with only a few non-College Football Playoff games remaining over the next couple of days. Here’s a look at how I think some of those will play out. Bowl season is winding down, with only a few non-College Football Playoff games remaining over the next couple of days. Here’s a look at how I think some of those will play out. I mean … Florida State will now be without its starting QB, backup QB, star RB, top-two WRs, star TE, first round EDGE and its best LB in the Orange Bowl.  Against Georgia.  We can debate all day about whether   in the College Football Playoff, but the fact remains that a worrying amount of Seminoles talent from the regular season will not be on the field against the Bulldogs. An only partial list includes: first- and second-string quarterbacks Jordan Travis and Tate Rodemaker (who threw all 25 of Florida State’s touchdown passes this season, with Travis adding seven rushing touchdowns), running back Trey Benson (5.8 yards per carry, 14 rushing touchdowns), wide receivers Johnny Wilson and Keon Coleman (91 catches, 13 for touchdowns), tight end Jaheim Bell (39 catches, two scores) and defensive end Jared Verse (first-team all-ACC, team-high nine sacks). Brock Glenn will start at quarterback for the Seminoles, just as he did in the ACC championship game against Louisville. Florida State averaged only 3.4 yards per play in that game, with Glenn passing for only 55 yards, and that was with most of FSU’s talent still on the field. Now all those players are gone, and you’re asking this team to move the ball against a Georgia defense that hasn’t lost all that much to transfers and opt-outs (at least compared with other teams)? Yikes.  Florida State team total under 12.5 points. The Flames have made a remarkable rise to a New Year’s Six bowl game in just their sixth season as a full-fledged Football Bowl Subdivision program, but I have a feeling this could get ugly. Liberty ranked  , a measure of overall efficiency, despite playing the following schedule of offensive lightweights: Bowling Green (No. 86 in SP+ offense), New Mexico State (No. 75), Buffalo (No. 125), Florida International (No. 121), Sam Houston (No. 120), Jacksonville State (No. 77), Middle Tennessee (No. 92), Western Kentucky (No. 55), Louisiana Tech (No. 87), Old Dominion (No. 97), Massachusetts (No. 99) and UTEP (No. 116). Now Liberty, which hasn’t played a top-50 offense all season yet was still kind of middling on defense, must get in front of a Ducks team that   in SP+ offense and will have most of the players that got them to that point — namely quarterback Bo Nix (No. 3 in the Heisman voting) and running back Bucky Irving (6.2 yards per carry) — on the field? The Flames also will be without transfer cornerback Preston Hodge, who had the team’s second-best Pro Football Focus pass-coverage grade. That’s far from ideal against an Oregon offense that ranked No. 2 in passing yards per game (342.8). I repeat: yikes.  Oregon team total over 42.5 points. The Volunteers’ offense took a hit Wednesday when quarterback Joe Milton   he’s opting out of this game to prepare for the NFL draft. Heralded recruit Nico Iamaleava — who has appeared in mop-up duty in four Tennessee blowout victories this season — will make his first career start against an Iowa defense that ranks   in expected points allowed per play and ninth in success rate. The Hawkeyes also haven’t lost many players since the end of the season beyond cornerback Cooper DeJean, who suffered a season-ending broken fibula during a late-season practice. Tennessee also will be  , the Vols’ first 1,000-yard rusher since 2015. He also opted out ahead of the NFL draft. Yes, we all know Iowa’s offense is dreadful (No. 131 in both EPA/play and success rate, and there are only 133 FBS teams). But seven members of Tennessee’s secondary  , including three starters. Even with all these departures, the Vols are nearly a touchdown favorite.  , and that’s including the statistics amassed by all the departed players. I think the Hawkeyes’ defense can keep this one close, despite Iowa’s noted offensive deficiencies.

"CANCÚN, Mexico — On a recent Friday, like nearly every day, Maricela de la Cruz woke up at 5 a.m. She caught two buses to get from her parents’ modest apartment on the outskirts of Cancún to the J.W. Marriott Resort & Spa. As tourists sunned on the white-sand beach outside, she spent eight hours scrubbing bathrooms and making beds. CANCÚN, Mexico — On a recent Friday, like nearly every day, Maricela de la Cruz woke up at 5 a.m. She caught two buses to get from her parents’ modest apartment on the outskirts of Cancún to the J.W. Marriott Resort & Spa. As tourists sunned on the white-sand beach outside, she spent eight hours scrubbing bathrooms and making beds. The 28-year-old housekeeper works six days every week. So do millions of other working-class people in Mexico — hotel staff, auto assemblers, waiters. But now, workers in the United States’ No. 1 trading partner are rebelling. The Mexican Congress is debating a constitutional amendment to guarantee employees two days off per week, a proposal pushed by unions. Over eight decades after   in the United States, it finally might be coming to Mexico. “Every worker dreams of this,” de la Cruz said. “More social justice.” The Mexican workers’ fight for the 40-hour week comes amid a growing global debate over work schedules. Yet there is a vast divide in how that conversation is playing out. While North Americans and Europeans experiment with a four-day week, many employees in developing countries toil six days — or more. (In India, a tech billionaire recently caused an uproar by suggesting a  .) The debate goes to fundamental questions of workers’ rights and their obligations to their companies and their nations’ development. De la Cruz joined thousands of cooks, waitresses, bellboys and gardeners marching through downtown Cancún under a late-afternoon sun last month, chanting “Yes to two days off!” “We’ve seen how other countries have shorter hours than us,” she said. But Mexico is less productive than more developed countries, said Jesús Almaguer, president of the Hotel Association of Cancún. “First, we have to develop economically and industrially in order to have these” — he paused — “these privileges.” The five-day fight’s most visible champion is , a raspy-voiced labor lawyer who once worked in an assembly plant in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, the maquiladora center across from El Paso After she won election to Congress in 2021 with the governing Morena party, she discovered there had been prior efforts to legislate a five-day workweek. Seventeen of them, to be precise. All failed. “I said, ‘I think this is the moment,’” Prieto recalled. Morena had a majority in Congress and controlled more than half of state legislatures — crucial for amending the constitution. And party founder Andrés Manuel López Obrador had emerged as Mexico’s most pro-labor president in decades. Since taking office in 2018, he has tripled the minimum wage, to the equivalent of around $1.80 an hour. He has doubled mandated vacation time, to 12 days a year. He has  of full-time employees. And Latin America was beginning to change. Traditionally, “our model of development has been based on low salaries and raw materials,” said Juan Carlos Moreno Brid, an economist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. But Colombia and Chile, both led by leftists, passed laws this year to  . In April, Prieto’s bill was approved by the House Committee on constitutional Issues. “The business owners had a heart attack,” she said. The push for change hasn’t come only from above. Unions have become more independent, in part thanks to the revamped   that took effect in 2020. In the negotiations, Mexico agreed to reform its system of weak, business-controlled unions. Now, workers have the right to choose their labor leaders by secret ballot. That has empowered people such as Mario Machuca, the Cancún-based regional representative for the Revolutionary Confederation of Workers and Peasants. The union has spearheaded protests in favor of the five-day workweek. “Today, those of us who are [union] leaders can raise our voices in favor of the workers,” he said. “Because we really are their legitimate representatives.” The labor reforms are getting an additional boost from a new generation of Mexicans who are more connected to the world — and each other — by the internet, migration and tourism. Alejandra Chang, 32, grew up watching her father work six days a week as a waiter. Now she does the same at a Cancún resort, Seadust. Between work and her commute — at least an hour each way — she has little personal time. She is determined to change that. Another day off each week “would change my life,” she said. “I’d see my family.” José Rubén Cob, 33, a cook at the Hyatt Ziva resort, has no doubt what is driving the worker mobilization. He holds up his iPhone. “It’s because of this,” he said. Workers are using Facebook and WhatsApp to organize demonstrations. “Now, if we share something here in Cancún, you can find out about it all over the country.” Mexico is among the  , according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. The average worker clocks 2,226 hours a year — 415 more than in the United States, and 540 more than in Canada. But Mexico has  : GDP per worker grew just 0.1 percent a year from 1991 to 2020, according to the World Bank. Growth across the OECD, a group of mostly wealthy North American and European countries, averaged 1.1 percent during that period. And around half the workforce still labors in the informal sector, with little access to legal protections or benefits. Economists warn that the informal sector could grow as employers try to dodge new salary and schedule reforms. In Cancún, a top foreign destination for American tourists, employers worry they will have to hire more workers to fill shifts, and then pass on the costs to consumers. Angélica Frías, the state representative of Coparmex, the national business owners’ association, has two words for the pro-labor folks: Punta Cana. The Dominican resort “will take away the tourists,” she said. “It will be cheaper to go to other destinations.” Frías, head of a consulting firm, prides herself on running a modern company. She wears a banana-yellow blazer and jeans. On the wall is a giant stencil of Steve Jobs. But even she has been taken aback by the flurry of labor reforms snaking through Congress. There’s a move to give new dads a paid, month-long paternity leave. A “chair law” mandates seats and rest breaks for employees who work on their feet. It may not be entirely coincidental, she said, that the presidential elections in June is looming. Prieto points to studies that show that reducing the workweek can result in better-rested, more-productive employees. But López Obrador, facing blowback from employers, recently urged Congress to hold a new round of negotiations on the change. The delay hasn’t discouraged the workers in Cancún, who are prepared to march again. “This is something we need,” said Chang, the Seadust worker. “Two days off.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/31/mexico-four-day-workweek-cancun/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 06:00:00,

LIGHTNING 4, CANADIENS 3 TAMPA, Fla. — Calvin de Haan ended his 46-game goal drought with the tiebreaking score in the third period, and Tampa Bay rallied past Montreal. The defenseman put Tampa Bay up 3-2 at 7:49 off a pass from Nikita Kucherov, who became the first NHL player to reach 60 points this season. Kucherov added an insurance goal before Nick Suzuki pulled Montreal to 4-3 with 2:05 left. Tampa Bay backup Jonas Johansson made 27 saves in his first game since Dec. 7.

Nichushkin also had an assist, Mikko Rantanen scored and Nathan MacKinnon had two assists for Colorado. Alexandar Georgiev faced just 11 shots in his 19th win. MacKinnon extended his home point streak to 19 games, the longest to start a season in franchise history. He matched his longest home point streak, set from Jan. 2 to March 24, and is four games shy of tying Joe Sakic for the club record. Sharks goaltender Kaapo Kahkonen made 30 saves. Tomas Hertl scored for San Jose, which has lost eight straight games — all in regulation.

Yet its own particular formula sets it apart from the others, in a town where eating is on the more formal side and tradition often trumps novelty. The interior design seems inspired by a modernized take on Art Deco and radiates posh vibes. But the elements of cool are tempered by the warm and cuddly floor-level seating arrangements for 12 canine patrons and their escorts — with fluffy oval mats lying next to marble tables, fancy ceramic bowls and high-end Panna water bottles on the side. By centering the experience on the pets themselves, Fiuto goes well beyond the “dog friendly” options found in so many cities. The menu, as conceived by the owners, displays reasonably priced haute-cuisine dishes, but dodges speciesism by not discriminating: The array of courses open to the dogs is almost equally sophisticated — including a choice of obviously non-alcohol-based fruity cocktails (humans can order the alcoholic varieties). And, the owners say, all of the food they serve to dogs is edible by humans, too. “One night a guest decided she should taste her dog’s meal,” said Marco Turano, 33, the restaurant manager and one of its three owners. “Turns out they were both happy with the result.” For my famished corgi, I opted for pork loin with a carrots-and-zucchini julienne — doubtlessly a welcome change from his regular strict diet — whereas I ordered myself some juicy parmigiana-filled tortellini as a primo. As much as the human-canine experience is intertwined, though, the two kitchens are quite separate. The one where food for dogs is prepared is located in a windowed booth, well visible at the bottom end of the main hall, while human courses are prepared deeper inside the restaurant. Sherlock’s sumptuous-looking dinner was delivered with a flourish in a luxurious matte black bowl. As soon as it was laid on the ground, my boy lunged at it with a markedly un-royal passion and scarfed it all down within a matter of minutes. It did look like he’d enjoyed it thoroughly. Luca Grammatico, 42, was the one who had prepared and served it, but this veteran dog trainer is tasked with yet another essential duty: playing the master of canine ceremonies. He keeps things polite and peaceful among customers, avoiding “cagnara” — the chaotic noise dogs produce while quarreling. As I was walking Sherlock by another table with a sweet but muscular female pit bull pup barely older than a year, Grammatico clocked how my corgi’s intrinsic exuberance was possibly about to elicit a negative response. He swiftly materialized behind my back, and politely tugged at Sherlock’s leash, deftly avoiding a diplomatic incident. Fiuto only opened in November and co-owner Mario Turano said it’s already doing “beyond expectations” and is at full capacity Thursday through Saturday, adding that at a Christmas party Wednesday, the restaurant was totally packed. Meanwhile, Sherlock was having better luck at socializing with Nina, a shy 4-year-old mixed breed who was tentatively sniffing at my corgi while also exchanging glances with a poodle a few feet away. “Nina liked her dinner a lot, as well,” said Loris Grambone, 24, a Rome-based vegan pizza chef originally from the town of Vallo della Lucania, about two hours south of Naples. She’d just had quite a rich meal for such a small thing: rice, beef, carrots and grana cheese for a primo, and another bowl — rice, codfish and zucchini — as a secondo. “As for myself, I had the gnocchi with black kale and Brussels sprouts,” Grambone said. “The next time she’ll surely get the dessert — and likely a drink as well,” he said. “I just need to figure out whether Nina would like that.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/31/dog-restaurant-italy-fiuto/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 04:00:00,
"As Jarrett Stidham takes over   as the Denver Broncos’ starting quarterback Sunday, there is considerable doubt that Wilson and the Broncos will repair their relationship. Coach Sean Payton made the switch Wednesday from Wilson, the nine-time Pro Bowl selection and Super Bowl winner for the Seattle Seahawks, to Stidham, a fifth-year pro who is on his third NFL team. As Jarrett Stidham takes over   as the Denver Broncos’ starting quarterback Sunday, there is considerable doubt that Wilson and the Broncos will repair their relationship. Coach Sean Payton made the switch Wednesday from Wilson, the nine-time Pro Bowl selection and Super Bowl winner for the Seattle Seahawks, to Stidham, a fifth-year pro who is on his third NFL team. Wilson confirmed to reporters Friday that the Broncos threatened in late October — during the team’s bye week and just after a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs — to bench him for the rest of the season if he did not agree to adjust his contract and address an injury guarantee tied to a $37 million offseason payment. Asked Russell Wilson if he wanted to talk.   asked him as well as we talked with Russell. He agreed. He was very candid about his disappointment about   approaching him about adjusting contract during bye week. He said he still would like to stay in Denver.…  The contentiousness leaves other NFL teams believing that Wilson, 35, probably will be available in the offseason, with the Broncos poised to release Wilson if they’re unable to trade him. “I don’t see how that situation gets fixed,” said a high-ranking official with an NFL franchise, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Wilson is under contract to another team. “I would think in your planning you would have to say that he will be on the market.” The $37 million payment due to Wilson under his contract currently is guaranteed against injury, and it becomes fully guaranteed in March. Wilson also confirmed that the league and the NFL Players Association became involved in the matter during the exchange that began in late October. “They came up to me during the bye week, the beginning of the bye week, on Monday or Tuesday,” Wilson said Friday, “and they told me that if I didn’t change my contract, my injury guarantee, that I’d be benched for the rest of the year. … “I was definitely disappointed about it. … The NFLPA and NFL got involved or whatever, I think, at some point.” Wilson is the NFL’s seventh-rated passer as he heads to the bench. “I came here to play here, to win,” Wilson said. “I knew it was going to be a process. I signed a seven-year deal for us to go and play hard. That’s my goal every time I step in between the white lines, is give everything I have. I want to be here. I want to play here. I want to be able to win here. I want to win championships here. … “I want to be the best teammate and leader that I can be, in the midst of it all. And so that’s why I was out here at practice every day. I told Jarrett I’d help him and do whatever it takes and keep the guys going and try to lead the right way. That’s all I know.”  LIVE: HC Sean Payton meets the media  Payton maintained Friday that the quarterback switch was made for football reasons and that he was not involved in any contract issues, calling that the responsibility of General Manager George Paton. “I understand the question,” Payton said at a news conference. “And it’s fair, and I totally get it. I’m not privy to any of those [conversations]. I’m handling the football. And I know this: The number one reason for taking this job, for me, was ownership and winning. … That’s something George and the front office [did]. I’m not involved in any of that. I mean, certainly I’m involved in a lot. And there’ll be a time and place at the end of the season where maybe some of the questions that you might have, someone else will be able to answer. My focus has been on winning.” The Broncos acquired Wilson in a March 2022 trade in which they   and draft picks, including two first-rounders, to the Seahawks. They   to a five-year, approximately $245 million contract extension that September, putting him under contract through the 2028 season. Wilson’s contract would count $85 million against the Broncos’ salary cap if they release him this offseason, though that cap hit might be spread over multiple seasons. Payton said Friday that the Broncos have not made a decision about Wilson’s status beyond this season. It remains possible that Wilson will stay with the Broncos under a revised contract. But that seems increasingly unlikely, given the tensions between the sides and the now-public nature of the contract squabble. The Broncos take a 7-8 record into Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers in Denver. They have lost two straight and three of four but remain alive in the playoff race. They’re 12th in the AFC standings in Payton’s first season with the franchise. It’s Stidham’s job now. His previous two NFL starts came late last season for the Las Vegas Raiders after they sat Derek Carr before releasing him in February. Stidham was a fourth-round draft choice by the New England Patriots in 2019. “I know how this has been written,” Payton said. “But this decision is strictly what I believe gives us a chance to win number eight.”  The Baltimore Ravens staked their claim   when they outclassed the San Francisco 49ers, 33-19, on Monday night in Santa Clara, Calif. The Ravens’ Lamar Jackson won his quarterback duel with Brock Purdy in lopsided fashion and became the clear front-runner for what would be his second league MVP award. But there was no time for the Ravens to savor that victory: They have another huge game Sunday, as they host the Miami Dolphins in Baltimore. The Ravens, at 12-3, are a game ahead of the Dolphins for the AFC’s top seed and can clinch it with a win. It is a rematch of a thrilling game early last season, also at M&T Bank Stadium, in which   to beat the Ravens, 42-38. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa threw for 469 yards and six touchdowns. Wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle combined for 22 catches for 361 yards and four touchdowns. The Ravens will not have to deal with Waddle this time after he was ruled out because of a high ankle sprain.  The Bills-Chargers game last Saturday night averaged 7.2 million viewers across Peacock, NBC stations in Los Angeles and Buffalo and NFL Plus, according to Nielsen. That’s a rather modest number. The average NFL game this season has drawn about 17.8 million viewers. The NFL’s three Christmas games Monday averaged 28.7 million viewers across TV and digital platforms. ICYMI:   Viewership Through Week 16! *New Top 5 Games of the Season (TV+Digital)  But putting the Bills-Chargers game on Peacock was another sign of the NFL’s commitment to streaming after it placed the Thursday night package on Amazon’s Prime Video and the NFL Sunday Ticket package on YouTube.

PAUL, Minn. — Dominic Toninato scored the tiebreaking goal in the third period and the Winnipeg Jets defeated the Minnesota Wild 3-2 on Sunday, sweeping a home-and-home series. Adam Lowry and Vladislav Namestnikov also scored for Winnipeg. Laurent Brossoit stopped 24 shots for the Jets, who are 6-0-2 in their last eight games. Marcus Foligno and Frederick Gaudreau scored for Minnesota, which lost for the third time in 10 games. One of those was a 4-2 loss at Winnipeg on Saturday. “Going into both games, you knew it was going to be a hard-fought battle,” Winnipeg coach Rick Bowness said. “There wasn’t much room out there. Kind of low-event game for a while. That’s the way both teams play. John (Hynes) has got these guys playing really, really hard. They’re tough to play against.” Marc-Andre Fleury, who was  , made 26 saves for the Wild. “I’m kinda happy it’s over. I wish it was a win. Disappointing,” Fleury said. “I thought the guys played great tonight. Battled hard. It’s a better game than last night in Winnipeg. Two points is what’s important here.” The teams traded power-play goals early in the third, with Gaudreau giving the Wild a 2-1 lead at 3:56 and Namestnikov evening the score less than a minute later. Toninato scored the eventual winner at 7:32 of the third. A delayed penalty was called on the Wild, and with an extra attacker on the ice, the Jets set up in Minnesota’s zone. Toninato chipped a rebound over Fleury and into the net for his first of the season. A tense atmosphere prevailed before the game as Wild star Kirill Kaprizov was scratched because of an injury that he sustained in Saturday’s 4-2 loss at Winnipeg. Kaprizov left that game in the third period after taking two cross-checks to the lower back from Jets defenseman Brenden Dillon. The Wild were upset that no penalty was called, and Minnesota defenseman Jake Middleton later fought Dillon, setting a hostile tone for a rematch less than 24 hours later. Just two seconds into Sunday’s game, Wild forward Pat Maroon and Jets captain Lowry dropped their gloves and fought at center ice. But that was the extent of the fighting for the day. “He just asked if I wanted to go,” Lowry said of Maroon. “We knew they would come out and probably be looking for a response after Kaprizov gets hurt. Just settle things down, try to get it out of the way rather than wait a little bit. “He asked me politely, let me take the faceoff, and it was one of the few ones I won tonight” Lowry added. “So (we) got that out of the way and we were able to play some hockey.” Ryan Hartman appeared to put the Wild on top 1-0 late in the first period, but the Jets challenged the play and the goal was overturned as a Wild player was ruled offside. But not long after, the Wild scored one that counted when Foligno redirected Jared Spurgeon’s shot from the center point past Brossoit at 18:07 of the first. Lowry tied it for Winnipeg early in the second, tucking a rebound of a Mason Appleton shot past Fleury for his seventh of the season. The Jets kept up the pressure in the second period, hitting a post and a crossbar, but Fleury kept them in check until the third, when Gaudreau temporarily put them ahead before Namestnikov and Toninato won it for Winnipeg.

Boston beat New Jersey at home Saturday night. “We have a tough travel with a 5 o’clock game, but we had really good energy and it was nice to pull that one off,” Frederic said. “Call it a little bit of a gutsy win.” Jake Walman scored his third goal in two games for Detroit. Ben Chiarot and J.T. Compher had the Red Wings’ other goals, and Alex Lyon stopped 23 shots. “We did some quality things tonight,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “You look back, we easily could have won that game. Probably our most complete 60 minutes from start to finish in a while. It just came against a team with a very slim margin of error to be successful.” The Atlantic Division opponents split their four-game season series. Frederic scored his first goal of the game with 51.8 seconds left in the first period. David Pastrnak flicked the puck out of his own zone as Frederic got behind Detroit’s defenders. Frederic backhanded the puck over Lyon’s left shoulder. “Pasta hit a nice little 60-degree wedge shot to me, and I was a little slow, so all I had was the backhand,” Frederic said. “I was lucky to get that over his shoulder.” Frederic crashed into Lyon, who was checked out by the team’s trainer but remained in the game. Frederic’s second goal and ninth of the season came at 4:25 of the second. He skated in along the right boards and wristed a shot that whistled through Lyon’s pads. “I think he’s playing faster,” Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said. ”He’s underrated as to how great a skater he is, and now he’s going north consistently instead of delaying, which he did a lot. He’s opening up space for himself and he’s got great hands.” Walman notched his ninth goal this season at 13:01. He lifted a shot from the left circle over Swayman’s shoulder. Chiarot scored his third goal later in the period from the slot to tie it at 2. Boston’s challenge of goalie interference was denied. Boston regained the lead at 3:52 of the third. McAvoy passed the puck to Coyle, who scored his 13th goal from the slot. DeBrusk’s empty-netter came with 2:01 remaining. Following a Boston penalty, Compher scored on a rebound with 1:22 left. Detroit had gone 0 for 5 on the power play before Compher’s goal. “I thought we had chances,” Compher said. “It wasn’t perfect tonight. You’re judged on goals and we weren’t able to capitalize early in the game.” Zacha’s empty-netter with 24 seconds to go clinched the Bruins’ victory. UP NEXT Bruins: At Columbus on Tuesday.

Ottawa rebounded from a 6-2 home loss to New Jersey on Friday night. “If we play the right way we shouldn’t have to bounce back as often as we do,” Forsberg said. “We’ve got to bring it every night and that’s something we’ve got to find as a group.

Zack MacEwen and Mark Kastelic each had their first goal of the season and Dominik Kubalik, Jakob Chychrun and Artem Zub also scored to help Ottawa improve to 15-18-0. Thomas Chabot had two assists in his return after missing 12 games because of a leg injury. “I think our mindset was the right one tonight,” Martin said. “I thought that we competed much harder right from the start and I thought we had good puck control. We had some giveaways, but I think, you know, we addressed it in between periods.” Tage Thompson scored for Buffalo, and Devon Levi made 26 saves. The Sabres are 15-19-4. “I felt like I shot 50 shots today and nothing really happened,” Buffalo’s Rasmus Dahlin said. “That’s how hockey is. You’ve just got to work. You can’t do anything about it.

"PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh Penguins enter January with momentum and — they hope anyway — an identity that can sustain them for the grueling stretch to come. Alex Nedeljkovic made 37 saves, Lars Eller scored twice and the Penguins held off the New York Islanders 3-1 on Sunday night for their fifth win in six games. PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh Penguins enter January with momentum and — they hope anyway — an identity that can sustain them for the grueling stretch to come. Alex Nedeljkovic made 37 saves, Lars Eller scored twice and the Penguins held off the New York Islanders 3-1 on Sunday night for their fifth win in six games. Pittsburgh is 7-1-1 overall over its last nine to climb into the Eastern Conference wild-card race as the the season’s midpoint nears. Perhaps more importantly than winning is the way the Penguins are playing. They’re largely avoiding the defensive lapses that cost them earlier in the season and getting a little offensive help from the bottom two lines to take some of the pressure off stars Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. The two goals from Eller and another from Noel Acciari gives Pittsburgh’s bottom two lines 17 goals over its last 13 games. “I think it just feels like the whole team is getting a little more traction,” Eller said after his first multi-goal game since April 12, 2022, while playing for Washington. “Our best players have been our best players all year but we need everybody to chip in ... that’s what we need. We need everybody to give something.” Nedeljkovic was spectacular at times while improving to 6-2-2 with the Penguins. His .923 save percentage is a massive jump from the .895 he posted last season with Detroit. He’s also become a solid 1B to Tristan Jarry’s 1A. The Penguins have given up the fourth-fewest goals in the league, one of the reasons they’ve managed to steady themselves despite their earlier offensive struggles. “We’re going to rely on both (goaltenders),” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. “They’re both helping us win right now. Jars played extremely well last night (in a win over St. Louis). Ned played extremely well tonight.” Samuel Bolduc drew the Islanders within one with 6:09 left with the third goal of his career but New York could get no closer. Ilya Sorokin stopped 35 shots but couldn’t stop the Islanders from falling to Pittsburgh for the second time in five days. And unlike the   last Wednesday, this one was in doubt until Eller’s empty netter with 43 seconds to go. “We played well enough to win the hockey game,” New York coach Lane Lambert said. “I think both goalies played well. We had some real good looks and didn’t get it by him, couldn’t get it by him. That was the difference in the game.” Nedeljkovic turned away an early breakaway by Casey Cizikas and made four stops in a 10-second span during a New York power play, including a diving save on a Brock Nelson slap shot in which Nedeljkovic dove to his left and stopped the puck with his outstretched arms despite a helmet so wobbly it came off shortly thereafter. “It was just a scramble and a couple of lucky plays on my part,” Nedeljkovic said. Eller gave the Penguins the lead 2:18 into the game with a nice finish at the goal mouth off a set-up from Jansen Harkins. Acciari doubled Pittsburgh’s lead 3:30 into the second when Drew O’Connor hit the breaks on the rush, pirouetted at the right circle to create some space then threw the puck toward the net, where Acciari redirected it by Sorokin. The Penguins played a portion of the second period without captain Sidney Crosby, who went to the trainer’s room to get stitches under his left eye after inadvertently getting hit with the blade of New York center Mathew Barzal. Crosby returned late in the second period but failed to record a point to remain at 1,538 for his career, one shy of Joe Thornton for 12th on the NHL’s scoring list.

TAMPA, Fla. — Calvin de Haan ended his 46-game goal drought with the tiebreaking score in the third period, and the Tampa Bay Lightning rallied past the Montreal Canadiens 4-3 on Sunday night. The defenseman put Tampa Bay up 3-2 with a shot from the left circle at 7:49 off a pass from Nikita Kucherov, who became the first NHL player to reach 60 points this season. It was his 22nd goal in 606 career games. “It’s nice to score once in a while,” de Haan said with a smile. Kucherov added an insurance goal before Nick Suzuki pulled Montreal to 4-3 with 2:05 left. Tampa Bay backup Jonas Johansson made 27 saves in his first game since Dec. 7. The Lightning got also goals from Brayden Point and Austin Watson. Lightning captain Steven Stamkos had an assist and set a franchise record by playing in his 1,038th game. Johnathan Kovacevic scored from his own defensive zone and Cole Caufield had the other Montreal goal. Sam Montembeault stopped 16 shots. “We played well enough to win,” Canadiens right wing Josh Anderson said. “It’s too bad.” Montembeault gloved a blue-line shot by Darren Raddysh. After holding the puck for a few seconds with no whistle from the referees, the goalie dropped the puck to Kovacevic. The defenseman took a couple of strides forward and, seeing that most players thought play was stopped, including Johansson, who had skated into the corner, fired home a long-distance shot into the vacated net to make it 2-0 at 11:59 of the second. “I was on the ice. I didn’t know what happened there for a second,” said Anderson, who thought the play was over. It was a “weird” situation, de Haan said. “I’ve never seen that before,” he explained. “Music came on and everything.” Point and Watson scored later in the period to tie it at 2. Watson, playing in his 500th game, sent a bouncing shot from along the left-wing boards that eluded Montembeault. Caufield opened the scoring 3:58 into the second after he stole the puck from Stamkos deep in the Tampa Bay zone. Lightning defenseman Erik Cernak left after taking a hard check behind the Tampa Bay net from Anderson nine seconds after Caufield’s goal. Anderson was assessed a charging penalty after a video review. “From what they told me, there’s no call on the ice,” Anderson said. “They were just seeing if he touched the puck. Obviously, I was shocked to get the charging penalty there.” Tampa Bay defenseman Haydn Fleury also left in the second after taking a shot off his right hand. Lightning forward Nicholas Paul skated off gingerly after being hit in the right knee by Stamkos’ shot in the third. Another defenseman, Mikhail Sergachev, missed his fifth straight game after being hit on the back of the left foot by a shot.

The Toronto Maple Leafs waived underperforming goalie Ilya Samsonov, and the Buffalo Sabres ended their three-goalie rotation by waiving Eric Comrie, a person with direct knowledge of the moves told The Associated Press on Sunday. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the teams have not announced the moves. Both players would land in the minors if they go unclaimed on Monday. Samsonov’s .862 save percentage and 3.94 goals-against average are each the second-worst among goalies with at least 10 appearances. In his most recent action, he allowed six goals on 21 shots Friday in a  . Samsonov acknowledged struggling mentally after he allowed five goals and 19 shots before getting pulled 1:03 into the second period of a   on Dec. 21. “I need to figure out everything in my head,” Samsonov said. “That’s the first (thing). It’s not about technique. It’s not about, you know, it’s not about nothing. Just in the head.” The 26-year-old Russian is 5-2-6 in his second season with Toronto after the Washington Capitals opted not to tender him a restricted free agent offer in the summer of 2022. Samsonov went to arbitration with the Leafs last offseason and was awarded a $3.55 million contract, $1.15 million of which comes off their salary cap if he’s sent to the minors. Buffalo, meanwhile, eases its roster logjam by waiving Comrie. The move frees up a valuable roster spot with forward Zemgus Girgensons ready to return from injured reserve after missing the past 17 games. Sabres goalies Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen and 22-year-old rookie Devon Levi have moved ahead of Comrie on the depth chart, splitting starts over the past 10 games. Comrie has an .863 save percentage and 4.01 goals-against average in seven appearances. The Sabres have lost the past six games Comrie has started. He has especially struggled since returning from a lower-body injury in mid-November, with a league-worst .827 save percentage and 5.17 goals-against average in four losses. In his first season with the Sabres, Comrie had a 9-9-1 record with an .886 save percentage and 3.67 goals-against average. He signed a two-year, $3.6 million contract with Buffalo after a career season in 2021-22, when he went 10-5-1 with a .920 save percentage and 2.58 goals-against average for Winnipeg. ___ AP NHL: ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2023/12/31/samsonov-maple-leafs-comrie-sabres-waivers/d5c97cda-a81b-11ee-bc8c-7319480da4f9_story.html,Washington Post,2023-12-31 15:33:00,
"PITTSBURGH — Evgeni Malkin had a goal and an assist, helping the Pittsburgh Penguins top the St. Louis Blues 4-2 on Saturday night. Malkin scored his 14th of the season on the power play. He also set up Drew O’Connor’s fourth of the year. Malkin has four goals and three assists in his last five games. PITTSBURGH — Evgeni Malkin had a goal and an assist, helping the Pittsburgh Penguins top the St. Louis Blues 4-2 on Saturday night. Malkin scored his 14th of the season on the power play. He also set up Drew O’Connor’s fourth of the year. Malkin has four goals and three assists in his last five games. “The last couple games, he’s played extremely well,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “When his confidence is high, you can see it in his body language. When he goes over the boards, he feels like he’s going to make an impact on the game and he has.” Jeff Carter scored his fourth goal for Pittsburgh in the third period, and Sidney Crosby’s 20th of the season was an empty-netter. Defenseman Erik Karlsson got his 600th career assist, and Tristan Jarry made 25 stops. Crosby is one point from tying Joe Thornton for 12th place on the NHL’s career points list. He became the 19th player in NHL history to score 400 even-strength goals and 22nd in NHL history with 16 seasons of 20 or more goals. The Penguins, who are 105-10-5 when Crosby and Malkin score in the same game, improved to 6-1-1 in their last eight overall. “We want to trend the right way,” Jarry said. “We need the points. Playing a good, solid team game helps our team play the right way. I think it’s been giving us success.” Robert Thomas scored his team-leading 15th of the season for the Blues, while former Penguin Kasperi Kapanen added his fourth. Joel Hofer stopped 26 shots for the Blues, who have lost two straight following a three-game winning streak. St. Louis is 5-3 under interim coach Drew Bannister. “We had some opportunities,” Bannister said. “We hit a few crossbars and posts, but we can’t make mistakes in the neutral zone and we can’t take penalties. The margin of error is too small.” Carter gave Pittsburgh a 3-1 lead at 4:48 of the third period. Hofer tried to play the puck up the boards, but Jansen Harkins intercepted and sent a pass to Carter, who redirected a one-timer across the line. Kapanen scored on a deflection at 10:21 to make it a 3-2 game. Kapanen, who was picked 22nd overall by Pittsburgh in the 2014 draft, stopped a 21-game drought with his first goal since Nov. 14. “It’s the loneliest feeling in the world when you can’t score, or it’s not bouncing for you,” Kapanen said. O’Connor opened the scoring for Pittsburgh at 15:32 of the first. He took a pass from Malkin and fired a one-timer past Hofer from between the circles. Valtteri Puustinen appeared to give Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead at 19:30. But the goal was waived off after Puustinen was whistled for high-sticking Brayden Schenn before his shot. Thomas tied the game with 25 seconds left on the Puustinen penalty at 1:06 of the second. He one-timed a Jordan Kyrou pass behind Jarry from a sharp angle near the side of the net. Malkin put Pittsburgh in front 2-1 with a power-play goal at 6:50 of the second. Jake Guentzel’s pass hit off Malkin’s right skate while he stood at the side of the crease near the left post. “(Malkin) is playing great now,” Guentzel said. “He’s a special player.

Michael Bunting and Seth Jarvis also scored for Carolina. The victory extended the Hurricanes’ winning streak to three games. Pyotr Kochetkov made 25 saves. “Our goalie ... was great” Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour said. “I hate that the last one counted because it was such a great save. “But he was the difference. Kept us in there, made some big saves and obviously we were able to capitalize on the power play early.” Timothy Liljegren and Nicholas Robertson scored for Toronto, which got 25 stops from Martin Jones. The Leafs have dropped three straight and five of their last six. “Yeah … even strength, our game has really improved (from) the start of the week,” Toronto captain John Tavares said. “We  , ended up letting the game get away from us, (then)   as we did yesterday.” Carolina went 2-for-4 on the power play, while Toronto went 0-for-3. “Team played hard, team played well. Obviously special teams are the difference in the game,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. “We knew that was going to be a major challenge coming in. “In the last month or so, both on power play and penalty kill, that’s been the top team in the league and it’s carried them through a lot. So 5-on-5, I liked our game a lot; defensively did not give up very much at all … but obviously, we didn’t score, couldn’t score enough.” Bunting opened the scoring just 2:24 into the contest on the power play. Aho found him open in the slot from behind the goal and he beat Jones five-hole. The Leafs continued to struggle finding the back of the net in the second period. Matthew Knies got a takeaway in Carolina’s zone and went in on net but couldn’t get a shot off trying to shield the puck from a defender. Jarvis doubled the lead on another power play at 13:52 of the second period. Liljegren put Toronto on the board 4:16 into the third period. Max Domi drove down the left side and found Liljegren trailing and he wired it past Kochetkov. Aho intercepted a pass in his own zone and dashed down the ice to score an empty-netter with 54.7 seconds left. Robertson scored with 10 seconds left to bring the Leafs to within one.

Vincent Trocheck had a goal and three assists, and Chris Kreider also scored for New York. Alexis Lafrenière had two assists, and Mika Zibanejad had an assist for a career-high 10-game point streak. The Rangers are the first team to reach 50 points for the first time since winning their last Stanley Cup in 1993-94. New York, which lost 4-3 at Florida on Friday night, is 6-0 in the second of back-to-back games this season. “Overall, pretty gutsy effort out of us in a pretty tough back-to-back” Rangers captain Jacob Trouba said. Tampa Bay’s Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 16 shots and NHL points leader Nikita Kucherov scored his 25th goal. The Lightning’s 39 points through 37 games is one behind their total after the same number of games in 2016-17, which was the last time they missed the playoffs. Tampa Bay has 80 shot attempts, compared to the Rangers’ 37. “The pucks we threw at the net, the chances we had, for us to only get one, that’s tough,” Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said. “Those are the things we’ve just got to keep doing.” Panarin had two third-period goals, including one on a power play to complete his sixth hat trick and give him 23 this season. He entered with two goals in 17 previous games against Tampa Bay. “It seems like he somehow continues to get better,” Trocheck said. “And he’s taking more and more steps forward, which is kind of crazy to think. He’s obviously an outstanding hockey player, one of the best in the league.” Panarin’s career high is 32 goals, set in 2019-20. Lightning captain Steven Stamkos played in his 1,037th game to tie Vincent Lecavalier’s team record for most games and had an assist. Shesterkin turned aside Stamkos’ slot shot in the second and Victor Hedman’s in-close third-period chance. He is 6-0-1 against Tampa Bay. Panarin scored 1:51 into the game off a pass from Trocheck during a 2-on-none that came about when Hedman fell going for the puck at the defensive blue line. Trocheck made it 2-0 at 7:36 of the first when he poked home a loose puck in the crease. After Kucherov had a power-play goal late in the second, Kreider reinstated the two-goal lead to complete a 2-on-1 just 51 seconds later. Kreider has a point in six straight games.

Leon Draisaitl also scored, Stuart Skinner made 26 saves, and the Oilers picked up their fourth straight win. “Every time we’re in this building, it feels like the exact same game,” McDavid said. “Rinse and repeat. It’s a grind. They’re a great team, and I felt we did a good job of just hanging in there.” McDavid fueled the Oilers’ comeback in the second period from two goals down, flicking in his low-angle shot off Cam Talbot’s helmet for a power-play tally 5:35 into the period and feeding Draisaitl in the slot during 4-on-4 play with 4:31 remaining to tie it up. McDavid played in his 600th career game and has 316 goals and 581 assists, the fifth-most to start a career behind Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Mike Bossy and Peter Stastny. McDavid broke a tie with Stastny for fourth-most assists through 600 games, behind Gretzky, Lemieux and Bobby Orr. “Anytime you’re mentioned with those guys, you’re doing something right,” McDavid said. “Those are three of the game’s very, very, very best, you know, so to be with that company obviously means a lot to me what that means. It’s a special, special group.” Adrian Kempe had a goal and an assist, Kevin Fiala scored, and Talbot made 24 saves as the Kings lost their second straight game. “We did some good things, we did some things that we put ourselves in tough spots, but that’s the type of game we’ve come to expect from these two teams,” coach Todd McLellan said. “For the most part, it was a hard fought game.” Kempe’s top-end speed factored into both Kings’ goals in the first period. It was his blazing entry into the offensive zone that occupied two defenders and left Fiala alone for a slap shot one-timer to open the scoring with 5:16 left. Kempe then charged in on a breakaway before putting his wrist shot off the right post and in from the right circle for a 2-0 edge with 1:11 remaining. It was his 10th multipoint game, giving Kempe three goals and three assists during a four-game point streak. “I still feel confident, like I have the last couple years,” Kempe said. “Obviously, would still like to see myself score more.

Scott Wedgewood made 24 saves to improve to 11-2-2. He made his seventh consecutive start since Jake Oettinger went down with a lower-body injury early in Dallas’ game Dec. 15. Marchment’s first goal came on the power play midway through the second period for a 5-0 lead. He scored at 14:29 of the third and completed his first hat trick of the season with 1:02 to play on a goal that caromed off the leg of Chicago’s Jarred Tinordi. “It’s happening all around the league. Teams are coming back. That was something we said going out in the third that we want to keep the foot on the pedal,” said Marchment, whose only previous NHL hat trick came in February 2022 for Florida. “And I thought we did a great job.” Smith, Suter and Seguin scored in the first period’s final nine minutes as Dallas, which went into play ranked 25th in the NHL with a minus-7 scoring differential in the opening period, matched its season high for first-period goals. “The main thing that we wanted to fix from the previous night was not to get in a hole and chase the game,” Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. “That first period kind of set the tone for the rest of the night.” Philipp Kurashev scored for the Blackhawks. They have lost 11 consecutive road games (0-10-1) and have the second-fewest points in the NHL at 24.

He was replaced almost five minutes into the third period by Arvid Soderblom, who gave up two goals on 10 shots. “My only hope from a game like today is we just finally hammer it through our thick heads of how we’re going to need to play,” said Nick Foligno, a veteran on a young Chicago roster. “And that is not it. It’s just not who we are. That’s not a winning team. That’s just a team hoping.” Hintz had a hat trick Friday and scored again 4:46 into the third period Sunday for his team-high 15th of the season.

"STRASBOURG, France — From the top floor of the house he shares here with a senior Russian diplomat — to whom he rents the apartment below — the man who helped bankroll the French presidential bid of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen has been working on plans to propel pro-Moscow politicians to power. STRASBOURG, France — From the top floor of the house he shares here with a senior Russian diplomat — to whom he rents the apartment below — the man who helped bankroll the French presidential bid of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen has been working on plans to propel pro-Moscow politicians to power. “We have to change all the governments. … All the governments in Western Europe will be changed,” Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, a former member of the European Parliament for Le Pen’s party, said in an interview. “We have to control this. Take the leadership of this.” For Schaffhauser, such ambitions are part of a decades-long effort to forge an alliance between Russia and Europe, the prospects of which, however distant, were shattered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But now, as Kyiv’s counteroffensive — and Western funding for it — falters and as governments in Europe battle rising living costs, plunging approval ratings and the rise of far-right populists, Schaffhauser and his Russian associates see fresh opportunity. Russia has been increasing its efforts to undermine French support for Kyiv — a hidden propaganda front in Western Europe that is part of the war against Ukraine, according to Kremlin documents and interviews with European security officials and far-right political figures. The maneuvering, and Kremlin connections with a host of far-right parties across Europe, including in France, are worrying some European officials ahead of European Parliament elections in June. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, warned at a conference this month that those elections could be “as dangerous as the American ones,” driven by “fear” in response to growing inequality and security threats. “Europe is in danger,” he said. The Kremlin documents, obtained by a European security service and reviewed by The Washington Post, show that Sergei Kiriyenko, the first deputy chief of staff in President Vladimir Putin’s administration, has tasked Kremlin political strategists with promoting political discord in France through social media and French political figures, opinion leaders and activists. Those figures were not identified by name in the documents seen by The Post. Moscow’s goal is to undermine support for Ukraine and weaken NATO resolve, the documents show. The effort parallels similar interference in Germany, where the Kremlin has attempted to marry the far right and the far left in an antiwar alliance,  . The talking points to be amplified by the Kremlin’s strategists included arguing that Western sanctions against Russia have damaged the French economy through a decline in trade, leaving the country at risk of falling into “the deepest social and economic crisis of recent years,” as well as asserting that the supply of arms to Ukraine has left France without the weapons to defend itself. Several weekly “dashboard” presentations to Kremlin officials in 2022 show that Moscow thought France was vulnerable to political turmoil. Citing opinion polls, the strategists noted that 30 percent of the French retained a positive view of Russia, the second highest among Western European countries after Italy, while 40 percent were inclined not to believe reporting on Ukraine by France’s own mass media. Later, in 2023, Kiriyenko’s Kremlin group ordered the strategists to promote messaging that would increase the number of those in France reluctant to “pay for another country’s war,” one of the documents shows. They were also told to increase “the fear of direct of confrontation with Russia and the start of World War III with Europe’s participation,” and to boost the number of those who want “dialogue with Russia on the construction of a common European security architecture.” The United States was to be described as using Ukraine as an instrument to weaken Russia’s position in Europe, the documents state. The documents show that troll farms created by the Kremlin political strategists produced and published social media content and articles critical of Western support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government. One note written by one of the strategists in June 2023 directed a troll farm employee to create a “200-character comment by a middle-aged French person” who considers Europe’s support for Ukraine to be “a stupid adventure.” The fictional French person was also supposed to argue that support for Ukraine is turning into “inflation … and falling living standards.” Asked about the documents, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said they sounded like “no more than the latest fake or total rubbish,” partly because Kiriyenko focuses on domestic politics and partly because “it is clear to all analysts” that “the whole of Europe is suffering” from sanctions on Russia “and there doesn’t need to be any promotion of this.” The Kremlin’s messaging has so far had limited resonance in France, where President Emmanuel Macron has been at the forefront of Europe’s efforts to support Ukraine and a majority of the population has backed him. But the visibility of pro-Russian accounts on social media is climbing in France, according to Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute for International Relations, and approval ratings for France’s far-right parties have been rising. Rhetoric from Russia allies like Schaffhauser — who maintains connections across the country’s far right — about the cost of the Ukraine war is increasingly being combined with the idea that it is an American adventure and that France needs to assert itself as a great power and restore relations with Russia. For part of the French establishment, the vision of France leading a grand Europe together with Moscow is “a dream which will never go away,” said Sylvie Kauffmann, editorial director at Le Monde and author of the recent book “Les Aveuglés,” or “The Blinded Ones,” about how France and Germany misread Putin in seeking to build close ties with him. “In this dream we are a big power and Russia is a big power and we are two big nuclear powers treating each other on an equal footing,” she said. At the end of June, after Paris erupted into riots over the police killing of a teenager of Moroccan and Algerian origin, a network of pro-Russian social media accounts became highly active, according to a study conducted by Alto Intelligence, a leading cybersecurity firm that tracks anomalous digital media activity across Europe. A tiny fraction of profiles — 1.2 percent — produced 30.6 percent of all digital media commentary on the riots. Among the most prolific accounts, 24.2 percent were injecting pro-Russian posts into the commentary. Most of the accounts were aligned with far-right French politicians such as Éric Zemmour or Le Pen, Alto found. Concerns are also growing that the Kremlin could seek to exacerbate mounting tensions over the  , a senior European security official said, adding that Russia was willing to exploit a wide array of political issues. In November, French officials said Moscow’s fingerprints were found on  between France’s Jewish and Muslim communities, both the biggest in Europe, following Israel’s invasion of Gaza. A Moldovan couple was arrested for painting hundreds of Stars of David across the streets of Paris, and French officials said they believed the couple was acting on the instructions of a pro-Russian Moldovan businessman. When France’s state digital watchdog detected more than 1,000 bots amplifying photos of those Stars of David, French authorities called the effort “a new operation of Russian digital interference against France,” and part of “an opportunistic and irresponsible strategy aimed at exploiting international crises to sow confusion and create tensions” in France and Europe. The state watchdog, Viginum, said it had a “high degree of confidence” that the bots were connected to a Russian disinformation network known as Recent Reliable News, which produces content aimed at undermining Western governments’ stances on the Ukraine war. Viginum noted that one of the bots’ main activities was to redirect to RRN websites. The RRN websites have also been a vehicle for a Russian operation known as Doppelgänger, which was exposed by French officials in June. It cloned and usurped the sites of well-known Western media brands such as France’s Le Monde — and, eventually, of the French Foreign Ministry — to produce fake content that included depicting Ukraine as a Nazi state and blasting sanctions against Russia as harming European economies. Viginum accused two Russian companies — Struktura and Social Design Agency — of being behind Doppelgänger. After a six-month inquiry this year into foreign interference in the French political process, France’s Parliament focused in on the Kremlin, declaring in its final report: “Russia is conducting a long-term disinformation campaign in our country” that seeks “to defend and promote Russian interests and to polarize our democratic society.” It also highlighted the role of Le Pen’s National Rally, finding that the party “maintains many privileged links with the Kremlin” and had effectively acted as “a communication channel” for its views. At the time the report was published, Le Pen told reporters the inquiry had not found “a shred of evidence that would prove Russian influence over National Rally,” claiming that it had passed judgment on her political opinions and “not on any form of interference.” The inquiry raised questions about whether National Rally, formerly called the National Front, had received “material support” from Russia in return for backing its positions, including through two loans organized by Schaffhauser to finance the party and Le Pen’s 2017 presidential campaign. The first loan, for 9.4 million euros in 2014, came directly from a Russian bank, while the second, for 8 million euros in 2017, was of more “mysterious” origin via an Abu Dhabi bank, the inquiry said. Sensing a change in the political winds after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Le Pen has become quieter on advocating closer ties with Moscow. Tarnished by the 2014 loan from Russia — which was paid back early, National Rally said in September — she has limited her comments mostly to the negative impact of sanctions on the French economy. But National Rally has withheld support for Ukraine in several key votes in the French Parliament, either abstaining or voting against the measures, and voices in the party and elsewhere on the far right have in recent months become louder on the issue of Ukraine and restoring relations with Moscow. Russia “is not going to drop the links they had” with National Rally, said Fiona Hill, a former director for Russia on the staff of President Donald Trump’s National Security Council. One of the party’s most prominent voices on Russia is Thierry Mariani, a member of the European Parliament who was singled out in the inquiry for his “great ideological and political proximity” to the Russian authorities. The report especially noted his leadership of the Association for Franco-Russian Dialogue, a Paris think tank founded by the Russian government that the inquiry said has long been a hub for promoting Kremlin views. The report also questioned Mariani’s frequent visits to Russia, and his role as an election observer rubber-stamping illegal votes held by Moscow-backed separatists in 2018 in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. The report also noted that he led National Rally delegations to Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. In connection with these visits, but without naming names, Nicolas Lerner, then head of France’s domestic intelligence agency, told the inquiry: “Some elected officials have clearly maintained clandestine relationships with [Russian] intelligence services.” In the past few months, Mariani has become increasingly vocal against Western support for Ukraine, telling the European Parliament in October that sanctions against Russia had only created more enemies for the E.U. Later, in December, he gave an interview to the Russian state news agency Tass, calling Zelensky’s policies “state terrorism” and accusing the Ukrainian president of behaving “like a Mafioso, ready to eliminate those whom he considers a threat to his power.” Then, in a post on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: “Europe will be paying for years to reconstruct Ukraine, whereas the United States will make money on the war to restart its economy.” In an interview with The Post, Mariani sought to play down his Russia links, saying he had merely discovered an affinity for Russia in 1976 when he was 17 and his military school sent him there to study the language. But he insisted that sanctions against Russia were leading Europe into an “economic catastrophe,” and that things would only get worse if Moscow tightened its lock on global commodity prices with the expansion of BRICS — an alliance of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa that the Kremlin sees as anti-Western — with the addition of Saudi Arabia and Iran early in 2024. For Schaffhauser — who faced special scrutiny in the parliamentary inquiry for his role facilitating the two loans for Le Pen — a primary objective is helping Moscow rebuild its connections to Europe. Arguing that China poses an existential threat to Europe, he told The Post in a series of interviews that he is proposing launching a foundation with Moscow’s backing that would advocate for a cease-fire in Ukraine, with the Kremlin maintaining its grip on the country’s eastern regions in return for drawing closer to the West again and out of its deepening alliance with China. He also said he would promote a new slate of Western European far-right leaders ready to do business with Moscow, ahead of the E.U.'s parliamentary elections next year. A senior Russian military intelligence officer, whom Schaffhauser said he’d been close with since the 1990s, has arranged for him to travel to Moscow in January to discuss these plans, he said. He added that he is due to meet with Sergei Naryshkin, an ally he first met when Naryshkin was speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament. He now serves as the country’s foreign intelligence chief. Schaffhauser denied that he was acting on Russia’s behalf, saying he was acting in France’s best interests. But he receives regular funding and support from the No. 2 diplomat in Russia’s Paris embassy, Ilya Subbotin, who pays him every month to rent one floor of his Strasbourg residence. Schaffhauser said it’s a commercial arrangement, with the space rented through an agency to Subbotin, who was Russia’s top envoy to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg until its mission was shuttered over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Subbotin declined to comment. The French parliamentary inquiry noted “the dense relational fabric” that Schaffhauser — a member of the European Parliament for Le Pen’s party from 2014 to 2019 — had built up over years of dealings between Russia and France. At one point, over the summer, shortly after the June riots rocked Macron’s administration, Schaffhauser said he’d even been in talks with several former senior French military intelligence officers about how to bring a network of former French generals to power in case of crisis and political collapse in France. “We have to propose the best government for France, a shadow government … people who are really patriots,” Schaffhauser said. In its report, the parliamentary inquiry warned of the propensity of former French officials, “particularly retired officers,” to echo Moscow’s positions and “develop speeches using Kremlin language.” For Schaffhauser, the recent breakdown in the U.S. Congress on funding for Ukraine means “it is a good moment to find a solution” — for a cease-fire and rapprochement with Moscow. But as tensions rise across the West over the Israel-Gaza conflict, he warned, the Kremlin’s confidence is growing. “Now it is easy” for Russia to stir unrest, said Schaffhauser. Moscow does not have “big work to do. They are prepared.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/30/france-russia-interference-far-right/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 02:00:00,
"ANAHEIM, Calif. — Warren Foegele had two goals and a career-high five points, Leon Draisaitl scored for the third straight game and the Edmonton Oilers routed the Anaheim Ducks 7-2 on Sunday to extend their winning streak to five. “It’s kind of surreal. I don’t really think about having those types of nights,” said Foegele, who set a career best with three assists. “We were moving the puck well and taking it to the net. We were fortunate with a couple bounces.” ANAHEIM, Calif. — Warren Foegele had two goals and a career-high five points, Leon Draisaitl scored for the third straight game and the Edmonton Oilers routed the Anaheim Ducks 7-2 on Sunday to extend their winning streak to five. “It’s kind of surreal. I don’t really think about having those types of nights,” said Foegele, who set a career best with three assists. “We were moving the puck well and taking it to the net. We were fortunate with a couple bounces.” Foegele became the ninth NHL player with a five-point game this season, and the second on the Oilers. Connor McDavid had a goal and four assists on Nov. 26 against the Ducks. Edmonton’s second line of Foegele, Draisaitl and Ryan McLeod accounted for four goals and 10 points. Draisaitl had a pair of assists and McLeod added a goal and an assist. “They’re starting to get some chemistry. They’re playing well,” coach Kris Knoblauch said. “They’re cycling the puck well, getting in on the forecheck and creating turnovers. They’re also not giving up valuable turnovers.” Evander Kane, Zach Hyman and Brett Kulak also scored for Edmonton. Darnell Nurse had two assists and Calvin Pickard stopped 28 shots. McDavid had an assist and needs two points to reach 900 for his career. The Oilers have won 15 of 21 games since Knoblauch took over as coach. After starting the season 2-9-1, they have moved within three points of Arizona for the second wild card in the Western Conference going into 2024. Anaheim’s Frank Vatrano scored for the third time in four games and leads the team with 17 goals. Max Jones also had a goal for the Ducks, who have dropped four of five on their eight-game homestand. John Gibson made 32 saves. Edmonton led 2-1 after 20 minutes before it broke open the game with three goals in the first 12 minutes of the second period. Draisaitl made it 3-1 at 1:48 when he hammered in a one-timer from Nurse at a nearly 90-degree angle. Draisaitl put the puck inside the near post and just beyond Gibson’s glove for his 17th goal of the season. Foegele then scored the next two in the period for his second multi-goal game of the season. “We came out in the second period flat-footed and they came out flying,” Anaheim coach Greg Cronin said. “We just kind of stood around and watched them skate around our zone. We didn’t stop progress. We didn’t get out into shooting lanes. We didn’t stop their movement at the blue line. You can’t play a team, like that, flat-footed.” Foegele helped open the scoring 4:15 into the game when he passed from behind the net to McLeod, who put the puck past Gibson. It was McLeod’s seventh of the season and fifth in five games. Jones tied it 1-all five minutes later on a rebound in front after Pickard made a pad save on Ryan Strome’s shot. It was his first goal in 14 games and fourth of the season. Kane produced the go-ahead goal at 17:22 on a wraparound, his 14th of the season. UP NEXT Oilers: Host the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday.

Nichushkin also had an assist, Mikko Rantanen scored and Nathan MacKinnon had two assists for Colorado. The game appeared headed to overtime when the Avalanche got a delayed penalty. With an extra attacker on, Jack Johnson fed Nichushkin for a one-timer at 16:31 of the third. It was his 17th goal of the season.

With an extra attacker on, Jack Johnson fed Nichushkin for a one-timer at 16:31 of the third. It was his 17th goal of the season. “We had so many good chances, but sometimes when you can’t score you start getting nervous,” Nichushkin said. “We get a good chance and we score.” Josh Manson added an empty-net goal at 18:53. MacKinnon extended his home point streak to 19 games, the longest to start a season in franchise history. He matched his longest home point streak, set from Jan. 2 to March 24, and is four games shy of tying Joe Sakic for the club record. Alexandar Georgiev faced just 11 shots in his 19th win while Sharks goaltender Kaapo Kahkonen made 30 saves. Tomas Hertl scored for San Jose, which has lost eight straight games — all in regulation. The Avalanche are 7-2-1 since dropping five of six in early December. They could easily be riding a five-game winning streak, but they blew a 4-0 lead at Phoenix and lost in overtime Wednesday night. Colorado defenseman Sam Girard played his first game since receiving care from the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program. Girard last played Nov. 18 and entered the program on Nov. 24, citing anxiety and depression leading to alcohol abuse as the reason for seeking help. He missed 21 games before returning to the lineup Sunday and logged 16:02 of ice time. “You watch his game, it was solid,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “He’s missed some time — I didn’t expect perfection right away. He’s just steady, he doesn’t make a lot of mistakes, so it’s another veteran guy that helps you at both ends of the rink, whether it’s penalty kill or power play. He plays everything for us.” Sharks defenseman Mario Ferraro left in the first period with an undisclosed injury and didn’t return. San Jose played the rest of the night with only five defensemen, and coach David Quinn didn’t have an update on Ferraro after the game. “He’s probably the heartbeat of the team, so it’s really tough to make up for what he brings to the table, both on and off the ice,” defenseman Henry Thrun said. Rantanen gave Colorado a 1-0 lead with a power-play goal at 6:58 of the first, his 19th of the season. Hertl tied it at 16:53 of the second with his 13th goal, eight seconds into a Sharks power play. “We lose our best defenseman five minutes into the game, playing a team that has a great chance to win a Stanley Cup,” Quinn said. “We didn’t have it today.

"Chinese Swifties will finally get to see Taytay — or Meimei as she’s affectionately called in China — strut her stuff in the “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” movie Sunday, when the global phenomenon opens in theaters. Two months after the movie opened in other parts of the world — and $250 million in box office sales later — Chinese authorities are allowing the film to be shown from New Year’s Eve, one of the busiest times of the year for moviegoing in the country of 1.4 billion people. Chinese Swifties will finally get to see Taytay — or Meimei as she’s affectionately called in China — strut her stuff in the “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” movie Sunday, when the global phenomenon opens in theaters. Two months after the movie opened in other parts of the world — and $250 million in box office sales later — Chinese authorities are allowing the film to be shown from New Year’s Eve, one of the busiest times of the year for moviegoing in the country of 1.4 billion people. Swift commands a huge and powerful fan base in China, where her albums have topped the charts and raked in millions on streaming services. Last year, she was the top-selling foreign artist on the Chinese charts. Her 2022 album “Midnights” sold nearly a quarter of a million copies in China in its first day of sales. The rerecorded “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” sold as many  , making Swift the best-selling artist on major Chinese streaming platforms during the first part of 2021, even beating megastars like Jay Chou, the Taiwanese king of “Mando-pop.” News of the movie’s imminent   has been met with jubilation and frenzied planning — as thousands of fans have mobilized across the country. Swift is one of the few foreign celebrities who have gained more than 10 million followers  , China’s answer to Twitter, and reaction online has been breathless. Since the announcement the film would come to China, the social messaging platform WeChat has been flooded with groups in different cities devoted to strategizing about how to band together to buy tickets before they sell out. Klyn Zhu, a 23-year-old who works for her family’s business in Jinan, the capital of the smoggy northeastern province of Shandong, told friends that she’d plan a viewing party at a local theater. Word got out, and her phone lit up — more than 1,500 people have been in touch, wanting to be part of the group. She’s now organizing nothing short of an extravaganza: three viewing groups and a short play about the infamous drama between Swift and Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Zhu dreams that videos of her group might one day show Swift herself just how much she means to Chinese fans. “I want her to see the power of fans here,” she said. “China is a big market, but she has never planned a tour here.” Many of the Jinan Swifties are in their early 20s and confronting an adulthood in China that looks   than the one they were promised, as the country grapples with its first   of their lifetime. They got hooked on Swift when she released “1989” during their high school years, and they find meaning and solace in her lyrics. “Every one of her songs fits a moment of my different experiences,” Zhu said. Her current favorite lyrics come from the song “New Romantics,” where Swift sings about building a castle from bricks thrown at her. “No matter what setbacks or difficulties I encounter, I just have to keep thinking that everything will turn out all right,” she said. In Beijing, people have scoured Imax theaters to secure commemorative popcorn cups and drinkware printed with Swift’s face even ahead of the movie’s release. In Chengdu, fans are planning coordinated outfits with references to favorite albums. Sebastian Han, a 23-year-old translator in Jinan, has been preparing for this moment for years, rehearsing Swift songs at regular karaoke nights with friends. Han credits Swift with immersing him in the English language through her music. Song by song, he learned the lyrics. Now he works full-time as a translator. Swift’s music means more to people in China than pop songs about love and romance — it’s about deeper issues such as how society values women and views on success, ambition and betrayal, Han said. “Songs are not just for listening to the melody,” he said. “They’re also for exploring the profound social issues behind them.” There’s a stringent vetting process for  , and not all American blockbusters make the cut. In recent years, authorities have focused on promoting Chinese films, making it even more of a rarity to be one of the few foreign films allowed into China. Although other American celebrities have been dropped in China over political comments, Swift has managed to steer clear of scrutiny — despite merchandise that seemed made to court controversy. With the release of her “1989” album in 2014, she sold merchandise reading “T.S. 1989” — her initials and birth year. The arrangement of letters and numbers could also be interpreted as a reference to a historic event that China’s censors have worked for decades to scrub from public consciousness: Beijing’s violent crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.  in hot water.

"A hectic and competitive two-week stretch in which most of the area’s girls’ basketball teams participated in holiday tournaments — some as far as California, others right in D.C. — concluded with the same top three that has held all season: Sidwell Friends, St. John’s and Bishop McNamara. Just about everywhere else, there was chaos. A hectic and competitive two-week stretch in which most of the area’s girls’ basketball teams participated in holiday tournaments — some as far as California, others right in D.C. — concluded with the same top three that has held all season: Sidwell Friends, St. John’s and Bishop McNamara. Just about everywhere else, there was chaos. The new year begins with six teams exiting the rankings and six new teams, headlined by No. 9 Archbishop Carroll, joining the Top 20. Though Bishop McNamara snapped the Lions’ nine-game winning streak Saturday, Carroll has otherwise held its own against local and national competition, with a win over Georgetown Visitation on Dec. 18 officially stamping the Northeast Washington program as a legitimate competitor. It looks to finish with its first winning record in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference since the 2007-08 season — though with five WCAC teams above it, that’s far from a given. Elsewhere, Briar Woods and Hammond join the Top 20 for the first time this season after spotless starts, while St. Mary’s (Annapolis), Osbourn Park and Robinson also make their returns after brief spells outside the rankings. The Quakers,  , begin 2024 with league games against No. 5 Bullis and No. 15 Potomac School. The Cadets won their games at Florida’s Kreul Classic and the D.C. Holiday Hoopla.

The Mustangs split their games against two of the nation’s top 10 teams, falling to Long Island Lutheran (N.Y.) before defeating Montverde Academy (Fla.). The Roadrunners won the Battle in the Bull Holiday Invitational and continue their rise after seven straight victories. The Bulldogs went 5-2 since the last rankings, competing entirely against nonlocal competition. The Cardinals reached the championship game in the San Diego Surf and Slam tournament before falling to La Jolla Country Day (Calif.). A highlight from the holiday break: senior Angelina Nice played just one half — and scored a school-record 40 points — in a 113-33 win over Surrattsville. Coach Scott Allen returned to the bench as the   and Virginia Academy by single digits. Impressive wins against nonlocal powers plus a commanding win over Georgetown Visitation vaults the Lions into the top 10. The Cardinals will look to avenge last year’s region final loss this week against No. 17 Osbourn Park. The Cubs continue to hover around .500; the start of Independent School League play should clear up their local standing. Sophomore Arianna Harris-Mott has kept the Panthers afloat during their arduous nonconference schedule; the team is 6-0 in league play. The Barons remain unbeaten against local competition but will have room to grow after getting thrashed by Baltimore’s Poly. The Saints are still looking for consistency, but a 16-point win over Potomac School at the Governor's Challenge was a step in the right direction.

"NEW ORLEANS — On the 120th day of Texas’s football season, on a metal bench inside the Superdome, Arch Manning — son of Cooper, grandson of Archie, nephew of those dudes on the Manningcast — spoke. Okay, okay, Manning has talked since enrolling at Texas last winter. He has peppered Quinn Ewers, Texas’s starting quarterback, with questions while they have roomed together on the road. Manning even played against Texas Tech on Nov. 24, meaning he had to call plays, meaning he had to say … something, about some things. But the program’s media policy stipulates that freshmen don’t meet with reporters until they have spent a significant time on the field. Manning, then, has been sort of hidden in plain sight, spending the year as the country’s most famous and relatively anonymous backup.

Manning, then, has been sort of hidden in plain sight, spending the year as the country’s most famous and relatively anonymous backup. Then came Sugar Bowl media day ahead of Monday’s College Football Playoff semifinal between No. 3 Texas and No. 2 Washington. Every player was available Saturday because that’s how media days go. Manning, 18 for another few months, was not one of the 26 players listed on a map distributed beforehand. That’s because he didn’t have a station with his name on it, leaving him to chill on the sideline with most of the rest of the team. But as soon as the Longhorns arrived, he was surrounded by 25 or so reporters, then stayed that way for the next 40 minutes. “I don’t see y’all giving this attention to other backups,” he said, suggesting he might get bagged on by his teammates for this. “But I’m used to it by now.” Manning has returned home to New Orleans, where the Superdome is about a 10-minute drive from Newman School, where he once whipped up a years-long recruiting war among the nation’s top programs. And after quarterback Maalik Murphy transferred to Duke this month, Manning is Ewers’s backup, putting him one play away from appearing in Texas’s biggest game in more than a decade. There were real, practical football reasons to ask him questions Saturday. It wasn’t just spectacle for spectacle’s sake. But on the other hand, there was the very 2023 ritual of dispelling what has been said about him on social media. The relevant snippets from that exercise: Is he looking to transfer (a question perhaps related to a photo of him and Mississippi State Coach Jeff Lebby in Starkville, Miss.)? “Obviously there’s all these rumors, but I haven’t looked into transferring at all. I’m just focused on developing and helping this team in any way I can and hopefully one day playing for the University of Texas like I always wanted to.” Are the online estimates of his name, image and likeness (NIL) earnings accurate (a question perhaps related to murmurs he out-earns San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy and his $870,000 base salary)? “I’m not involved with my NIL. You’d have to ask my dad about that. I have no idea. I don’t think, however, I’m making much more than Brock Purdy. Someone sent me that the other day.” And maybe most importantly, is he really 6-foot-4 (a question perhaps related to him being listed as 6-4 on Texas’s official roster)? “I think so.” At that, Manning cracked up. Throughout the interview, despite answering some questions two or three times, he laughed a lot. He seemed comfortable, like a teenager who grew up in football’s first family and is used to a glaring spotlight. When asked about his major (communications), he grinned and told a reporter he might have to ask him for tips. Asked about wanting to play in the Superdome, especially considering he never made it to the state final there in high school, he suggested telling Longhorns Coach Steve Sarkisian that he could return a kick. Asked about Newman’s 10-2 season, he mentioned its talented quarterback, Eli Friend, and said the reporters should “go bother him some.” Pressed for his nickname with teammates, Manning offered up “Archibald.” Why? In January, he left his ID — the one identifying him as Archibald Manning — in an English lecture. A student picked it up, swiped her way into the football facility and returned it to the football staff. Sarkisian then FaceTimed Manning, asking if he knew where his ID was.  . At some point, he lost it again, though the original was in the pocket of his black sweatpants Saturday, safe and sound. “Arch is obviously a really talented kid,” said Greg McElroy, the former Alabama quarterback who will call Monday’s game as an ESPN analyst. “If you just watch the Texas Tech game, I know the numbers aren’t going to blow you away. But I’ll be honest: As an analyst who has to watch a lot of football on a week-to-week basis, it’s not often I’m watching every single snap for a backup quarterback in a [50-point] blowout. But I want to watch those. “My interest level was similar to y’all’s. I’m curious just like you guys are. If you have the last name Manning on the back of your jersey, that comes with great expectations.” Especially here — and especially in this building. Straight across from where he sat Saturday, way up in the rafters, was the beginning of the legacy he now carries: “Archie Manning | 1971-1982.” Two generations later, Arch has attempted only five passes as a college quarterback. There is a chance Ewers returns for another season, meaning he would have to keep waiting his turn or seek immediate snaps elsewhere. But for now, he could brush all that aside, look up at his granddad’s name and feel his feet on the Superdome’s turf. Arch was home and still on his way.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/arch-manning-speaks/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 13:50:00,
"Lamar Jackson lost his all-pro tight end,  , to injury during a mid-November game. And the Baltimore quarterback still led his Ravens to a win and has won the four games since. Jackson lost his main running back, J.K. Dobbins, in the first game of the season. And Jackson picked up the slack by rushing for 182 yards and four touchdowns in the next three games. Lamar Jackson lost his all-pro tight end,  , to injury during a mid-November game. And the Baltimore quarterback still led his Ravens to a win and has won the four games since. Jackson lost his main running back, J.K. Dobbins, in the first game of the season. And Jackson picked up the slack by rushing for 182 yards and four touchdowns in the next three games. Jackson inherited a new offensive coordinator, Todd Monken, to whom he adjusted his style to pass more than ever, and he has done so at an efficient pace to a mix of young receivers and veterans such as 31-year-old Odell Beckham Jr., who had not played in a year. Maybe most remarkably, Jackson wasn’t afforded fair treatment by the NFL last offseason, yet, with his mother’s guidance and some assistance from the players union, still was able to garner what was then a league-record   from the only team for which he has played and create some freedom for himself as an agent in our favorite pro sport that is least forgiving of its athletes. The MVP award that Jackson should be handed at season’s end will not adequately represent all that he accomplished this season. For himself. For his team. For other players in the league. The league has never seen such an impactful, transformative performance by a player in a single year since maybe Joe Namath. The argument that there is a more worthy winner for the league’s most notable individual honor isn’t up to date with what Jackson has done. Christian McCaffrey is having an outstanding year as San Francisco’s star running back. The quarterback from whom he gets the ball, Brock Purdy, is also performing exquisitely, no matter his wilting on the same field last weekend against Jackson, who   over the 49ers. But those are campaigns, superlative notwithstanding, we’ve seen before. “Lamar Jackson, he’s unlike anybody else,” said Miami defensive coordinator Vic Fangio on Thursday via the Dolphins’ website. In many ways, Jackson is, along with Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes, cutting a new swath for other quarterbacks who can pass and run with equal effectiveness. But Jackson is more likely to run by design than survivability. “The only other player that’s been like him in the last 50 years is Michael Vick,” said Fangio, who has been tasked with slowing Jackson on Sunday in Baltimore. “He’s a tremendous player. Kudos to Ozzie [Newsome] and Eric [DeCosta] for picking him. Thirty-one other teams that passed him by are kicking themselves.” Some of those teams maybe twice. After all, as Jackson and the Ravens appeared to   last offseason, none of the many teams in need of a quarterback were said to have reached out to Jackson after he announced he wanted to be traded. It was as if the league colluded against Jackson. It made little sense, as many of Jackson’s teammates and opponents opined on social media. And for good reason. What any team in quarterback need missed out on by not reaching out to Jackson was a 26-year-old quarterback in his sixth season this year completing a career-high 66.3 percent of his passes at 7.7 yards per attempt. One who is still the leading ground gainer among quarterbacks but is gaining less than ever at 52.4 yards per game, ostensibly protecting his body more against injuries like the one that knocked him out of last season’s playoffs, which the Ravens didn’t survive without him. Injury was said to be the main reason other suitors didn’t develop for Jackson. He has missed 10 games over the past two seasons with various pains. Atlanta owner Arthur Blank even allowed as much in explaining why his Falcons didn’t pursue Jackson, who in just his second season in 2019 won his first league MVP award in electrifying fashion. The Falcons are 7-8 with an offense 20 rungs behind that of Jackson’s Ravens. Injury history didn’t stop the Bengals from  , who is  , to a big deal. “He’s really improved over the years,” Fangio noted of Jackson. “Dynamic with the ball. Good passer. He makes their offense go.” Jackson hasn’t missed a game this season, one in which it looked as though he would play only  , which is the NFL’s way of restricting free agency, particularly for the game’s biggest stars. But Jackson stuck as best he could to his convictions. He came as close to doing what other players of his stature should do to get what is due them. He held out for every million he could get, guaranteed. He apparently shunned the noise that he was anything but smart for trying to go the distance himself. And he managed a five-year, $260 million contract, of which $185 million is guaranteed. Jackson also got the Ravens to agree not to pin a franchise tag on him again when the deal expires after the 2027 season, which gives Jackson the freedom to shop his talents to every team. Jackson’s brethren in the union ought to take as much notice of Jackson’s negotiations as they do his passing, running and guile on the field. He was steadfast. He was unmoved by criticism swirling about him as a contract negotiator following his mother’s counsel. They understood and exercised his value, something too few NFL players do. And with all the pressure of expectations that a quarter-billion-dollar contract brings, Jackson is handling it. He appears to be doing so with the same calm and collectiveness he showed in negotiating his deal with the Ravens. Jackson is winning his bet on himself — breaking the house, I would say, unlike anyone except his mother and he probably imagined.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/lamar-jackson-mvp-contract/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 09:00:00,
"A combined rocket and missile attack on Belgorod, a city in Russia near the Ukrainian border, has killed at least 24 people and injured more than 100, Russian authorities said Saturday, blaming the assault on Ukraine’s military and vowing to retaliate for the deaths. “This crime will not go unpunished,” Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement, calling the strikes “indiscriminate.” A combined rocket and missile attack on Belgorod, a city in Russia near the Ukrainian border, has killed at least 24 people and injured more than 100, Russian authorities said Saturday, blaming the assault on Ukraine’s military and vowing to retaliate for the deaths. “This crime will not go unpunished,” Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement, calling the strikes “indiscriminate.” The attack, if confirmed, would be one of the deadliest inside Russia since it invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago. It came as Ukraine was still reeling from the massive drone and missile barrage Russia unleashed on civilian targets and infrastructure Friday. In that bombardment, one of the largest of the conflict, 39 people were killed and 159 injured, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday. He said the strikes hit 120 cities and villages, and urged Ukraine’s allies to maintain the flow of weapons to Kyiv, which has struggled in recent months to claw back territory seized by Russia. “We cannot delay helping those who oppose terror,” he said. “We must all defeat terror together.” Ukrainian officials have not commented publicly on Saturday’s attack and rarely, if ever, claim responsibility for strikes inside Russia. But in an address late Friday, Zelensky said Ukraine would “respond to Russian terrorists for every strike.” “We will continue to strengthen our air defense,” he said. “And work toward pushing the war back to … where it came from — home to Russia.” Russia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that Czech-made Vampire rockets and Olkha missiles armed with cluster munitions were fired at Belgorod, about 18 miles from the Ukrainian border. Antiaircraft units intercepted 13 of the rockets and missiles, the ministry said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed on the attack. The Foreign Ministry also said it requested a U.N. Security Council meeting to address the strikes. Three children were among those killed in Belgorod on Saturday, while five children remain in critical condition, according to Russian Children’s Rights Commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova. On Telegram, Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said there were casualties after a residential area was hit. In an evening video address, Gladkov said that  all public events in the region would be canceled ahead of the New Year’s holiday. “Today, the most serious consequences of the last two years took place as a result of the Ukrainian army’s attack,” Gladkov said in the address. “To all the families of the victims, I understand that there are no words that could console this grief... the enemy will not be able to escape retribution.” Videos circulating online after the attack showed thick black smoke billowing from blown-out cars in the city center. Bodies were shown strewn on the ground, and in the footage panicked people ran from the scene. Belgorod and the surrounding regions that border Ukraine have come under near-constant shelling and frequent drone attacks over the past year, but civilian casualties are rare. “A tragedy occurred today in Belgorod. As a result of the attack by Ukrainian terrorists, peaceful civilians and children were killed, there were many victims … what happened is simply monstrous,” Alexander Bogomaz, governor of the nearby Bryansk region, which also borders Ukraine, wrote in a Telegram post. Later Saturday, an apparent missile strike hit the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, about 44 miles south of Belgorod, injuring at least 19 people at a hotel and in a residential building in the city center, the local governor said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/30/belgorod-russia-ukraine-war/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 08:47:00,

"NASHVILLE — With its record-setting starting quarterback unavailable, the Maryland football team got a lengthy look at its potential future in Saturday’s Music City Bowl. Billy Edwards Jr.’s audition went about as smoothly as Terrapins Coach Michael Locksley could have scripted in the early stages, included some hiccups later and culminated in a 31-13 triumph over Auburn at Nissan Stadium. NASHVILLE — With its record-setting starting quarterback unavailable, the Maryland football team got a lengthy look at its potential future in Saturday’s Music City Bowl. Billy Edwards Jr.’s audition went about as smoothly as Terrapins Coach Michael Locksley could have scripted in the early stages, included some hiccups later and culminated in a 31-13 triumph over Auburn at Nissan Stadium. The redshirt sophomore and heir apparent to Taulia Tagovailoa, the Big Ten’s all-time leader in passing, accounted for 176 yards of total offense, although he completed just 6 of 20 passes, and directed touchdowns on his first two series to help Maryland (8-5) earn a bowl victory in three consecutive years for the first time. The Terps scored touchdowns on their first three possessions to complete a third consecutive winning season for the first time since 2001 to 2003. And they won eight games in back-to-back years for the first time since 2002 and 2003. “I just tried to go out there and do my job to the best of my ability,” Edwards said after his first start this season. “Obviously I was grateful for the opportunity. The biggest thing in my mind going into this game, I put a lot of pressure on myself. I just wanted to win for these older guys.” The transfer from Wake Forest, a Northern Virginia native who played at Lake Braddock High, was voted Maryland’s MVP after he rushed for one touchdown and passed for another in place of Tagovailoa, a four-year starter who several weeks ago said he would opt out of the game, presumably to concentrate on the NFL draft. Cameron Edge, the third-string quarterback in the regular season, also received some playing time, leading a first-quarter touchdown drive in front of a crowd of 50,088 who began streaming out of the stands when cornerback Glendon Miller stepped in front of a severely underthrown pass by Tigers quarterback Payton Thorne. The redshirt junior returned the interception 44 yards for a touchdown and a 31-7 lead with 11:05 to play in the third quarter. Miller raised an arm in celebration during the return, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty enforced on the kickoff, but Maryland, which forced four turnovers, got the ball back when the Tigers (6-7) fumbled the return. Edwards was able to enjoy an extended stretch of the second half from the sideline, the outcome all but settled. “I’m really happy with the way the quarterback performed — both of those guys,” said Locksley, who has said he will hold an open competition for the starting role entering next season. “There were some great learning moments. It was a lot of great teaching and learning throughout the course of this game, and I saw some of young guys, including our quarterbacks, grow up today.” Maryland had a 24-7 lead at halftime thanks to a scoring drive that began with 2:28 to play in the second quarter after the Tigers had drawn within 14. Edwards accounted for all 38 yards during the series, which ended with redshirt sophomore Jack Howes’s career-best 49-yard field goal with eight seconds to go. That was the longest field goal in bowl history for the Terps. Edwards made just the second start of his career but had played in seven games this year, serving as the goal-line replacement for Tagovailoa. In the final two games of the regular season, Edwards rushed for five touchdowns, highlighted by three on four carries in   on Nov. 18. His responsibilities grew far more extensive against the Tigers, who also were without several notable opt-outs Saturday. But Maryland faced additional uncertainty in the starting lineup with cornerback Tarheeb Still opting out and linebacker Jaishawn Barham and tight end Corey Dyches entering the transfer portal. Dyches was one of Tagovailoa’s favorite targets, but Edwards had a full complement of wideouts, the majority of whom are expected to be back next year. On the opening possession, Edwards leaned on tailback Roman Hemby, who took a short pass 61 yards to the 2, breaking several tackles along the way. One snap later, Edwards capped the drive with a run through the middle for a 7-0 lead. Edwards directed another 75-yard touchdown drive on Maryland’s ensuing possession, completing a five-yard pass to tight end Preston Howard for a 14-0 lead with 5:58 to play in the first quarter. It was the first passing touchdown of the season for Edwards and the fourth of his career. Edge took over for the third possession as the Terps remained aggressive, with Edge finding wide receiver Kaden Prather for a 57-yard pass to the Auburn 3. Maryland called a timeout on first and goal with the play clock about to expire, but on the following snap Edge connected with tight end Dylan Wade for a 21-0 lead. That gave Maryland the most points in the first quarter of a bowl game in program history. “Being able to practice and play in a game like this is just so instrumental in us being able to continue to develop because you can’t get this type of experience,” Locksley said. “… It’s a precursor to next year while also trying to finish up this season.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/maryland-wins-music-city-bowl-billy-edwards-jr/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 19:19:00,

Tough as nails. And clutch. Great teammate. Ray’s on field accolades speak for themselves,” Ravens President Sashi Brown   in a story posted on the team’s website. “He was also consistently in the community, giving back. Importantly, after Ray’s incident he owned it. On his own accord, Ray undertook critical work within himself and to bring awareness to and educate others on domestic violence.

He ranks second in franchise history behind Jamal Lewis in rushing yards and touchdowns. In February 2014, Rice and Palmer were charged with simple assault after Atlantic City police said they struck each other during a fight.

Out of the public eye, Rice has been working on himself, his relationship, and within the community.” Rice said he has grown from the incident and is “trying to be the best version of me.” “I knew it would be hard to forgive me, but the one thing I have been consistent with was that I was going to be better,” he said in the story posted on the Ravens’ website. “I’m not going to be a victim of my past.

Now, aided by pace, energy and three players averaging at least 10 points per game — McKenzie, sophomore Peyton White and freshman Grace Ellingson — they’re as consistent as any team around. “I can go with five guards on the floor at the same time or I can go with a lineup that’s bigger than my sister’s lineup when she was the head coach at Longwood,” Nemerow said. “And I don’t think we have a drop-off in talent either way.” Still, with Cedar Run District foe Osbourn Park thriving again, there’s little tolerance for plateauing. Though Gainesville lost just five games last year, four of those came against the Yellow Jackets. Last year, McKenzie said, the Cardinals beat themselves. This year, with six seniors, they hope the mental edge is on their side. Both teams enter Friday’s matchup in  . “We’ve been pushing each other because we know how great we can be,” White said. “They’re a great team, they’ve got a great coach … but we’re going to try and get them this season.” The Rock Creek Christian Eagles have played a lot of basketball. In November and December, the Prince George’s private school has played as many games as many public programs do in an entire season: On Saturday afternoon, the Eagles lost by four to nationally ranked Compass Prep (Ariz.) in their 20th game of the year. This is the White team, one of two varsity programs representing Rock Creek. The group is coached by Lafayette Dublin, now in his second coaching stint at the school. Rock Creek has often had two teams in the past, but last year the White team did not exist. When Dublin came back, he brought a whole new roster with him. Despite the loss to Compass, it has been a successful start to the year for the Eagles (16-4). They spent last weekend at the Governor’s Challenge, a massive tournament held every year in Salisbury. They won their bracket, topping Fairfax Christian, 72-69, in double overtime to do so. “We got off to a slow start the first time we played them, waited too long to start playing hard,” Dublin said. “The difference this weekend was we competed from the beginning of the game. We matched their level of intensity and stayed with it.” That Fairfax Christian team was undefeated, and had taken down the Eagles in early December. But, with so many new players, Dublin has seen the Eagles grow stronger the more time they spend together. And their relentless, travel-heavy schedule means they get a lot of down time as a group. “Often times you see the kids break into cliques, but this group has a great chemistry,” Dublin said. “We’ve spent a lot of time together. Ate together. Danced together. Traveled together. They’ve learned to trust each other. And that translates to the court.” On the court, they prioritize defense above all else. Junior forward Kam Wylie led the team with 25 points in the win over Fairfax, but it was a few key stops in overtime that Dublin credits for the win. “We spent the first two months of practice doing mostly defense,” Dublin said. “We pride ourselves on that. If you don’t get stops, you don’t play. We don’t want to constantly trade baskets.” The senior guard was named MVP of the M.L. Carr Invitational in North Carolina, scoring 26, 28 and a school record 40 points as the Huskies went 3-0 in the tournament.  The dynamic freshman, following in  , led the Mustangs with 19 points as they beat Carroll, 63-39 to win their bracket at the Boo Williams Holiday Classic. The junior poured in 25 points and 12 rebounds in the Lions’ 68-41 win over Constitution (Pa.) in the Governor’s Challenge in Salisbury. The senior wing had 30 points, five rebounds and four steals in the Golden Bears’ two-point win Friday over North Point. In Hammond’s next game, a win over Oxon Hill to clinch the All About the Girls Holiday Hoops Garon Everett Division title, Green scored nine points and added seven assists, six blocks and six rebounds. , Wednesday, 6:15 p.m. , Thursday, 5:45 Thursday, 7:30 p.m. , Friday, 5:30 p.m. Martina Casamajo didn’t have a massive language barrier to vault over when she moved to Maryland from Spain, the product of learning English in school. But as she found out in one of her first practices with Bethesda-Chevy Chase (7-1), basketball’s vernacular greatly varies. The Barons were practicing a 3-2 zone, a defense Casamajo knew as “Diaman” (Diamond). The dialect mix-up took a few minutes to sort through and was one of the adjustments Casamajo made while playing a familiar sport in a foreign land. Casamajo grew up in Badalona, a city near Barcelona that has taken to basketball in large part because of its local team, Club Joventut Badalona — or as Casamajo and others call it, La Penya (The Club). The community’s basketball fever saturated through the senior forward. Casamajos loves Ricky Rubio — who started his professional career with La Penya — and former Real Madrid star Luka Dončić. “While he was there, that was the only time that I’ve liked Madrid,” she said. Casamajo has played basketball for nearly a decade and knew she wanted to continue doing so after moving to Maryland. She arrived mere days before the school year began and had to spend her first few months catching up on college applications, keeping her out of the Barons’ offseason activities. But she made sure to come to tryouts. “I just wanted to play with my high school team in the United States and I thought that was a very cool experience,” she said. Her background provides a different viewpoint on high school basketball. She was surprised by the Barons’ practices, tailored to upcoming opponents rather than having a more general focus like in Spain. She enjoyed the sense of community within the team, evident in pasta dinners the night before games, locker room traditions and more. She has been inspired by her teammates’ dedication to the sport and to each other. “We have practices six times a week and all of them show up and they do their best,” she said. “ … When you see someone feel so passionate about a sport that you also love, it just makes you want to do better and put effort into it and just go to every practice and play like it’s the last practice.” — Some nights, it’s senior guard Shayonna Nave carrying the offensive load for the Anacostia girls. Other nights, Nayjah Duvall or Ta’shaun Robinson take the lead as the team’s primary scorer. Coach Reginald Walker’s team has a number of players capable of making opposing defenses pay as it has emerged as a D.C. public school contender early this season. “No one team can focus on any one player,” Walker said. “If you take away this [player], this one is going to hurt you.” Anacostia’s depth is a positive sign as the team inches closer toward the postseason. But in Walker’s eyes, his team’s offensive parity has drawbacks. “At some point someone’s going to have to stick out and become that real leader,” he said. “Somebody to step out there and say ‘Hey, c’mon, we got this, just ride with me.’ … That’s what we’re looking for right now.” The Indians are 8-4, with wins over Theodore Roosevelt and Banneker, pushing the young group to the top of the D.C. Interscholastic Athletic Association standings through the first month. Anacostia beat the Roosevelt, 52-27, on Friday before falling to Friendship Collegiate by six points Saturday. As Walker waits for a consistent scoring leader to emerge, he knows there’s plenty of room for improvement for a team he said had “the most potential we’ve ever had” over his 11 years as coach. That potential will be put to the test against upstart Eastern and defending city champion Dunbar in early January.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/gainesvilles-versatility-is-paying-off-rock-creek-christian-stays-busy/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 11:30:00,

"PLAYA DEL REY, Calif. — Near the coastline where the waves have gotten bigheaded lately, along a sidewalk with those fine angles of afternoon sunshine that seem to belong to Los Angeles, in the kind of earthy outdoor-indoor bar in which beach villages specialize, a dozen or so impressive football fans gathered Saturday. PLAYA DEL REY, Calif. — Near the coastline where the waves have gotten bigheaded lately, along a sidewalk with those fine angles of afternoon sunshine that seem to belong to Los Angeles, in the kind of earthy outdoor-indoor bar in which beach villages specialize, a dozen or so impressive football fans gathered Saturday. They stayed well north of somber even given what they watched. They cringed and groused and yearned for interference calls that didn’t come. They cared even as their depleted Florida State Seminoles cratered understandably 2,300 miles away in the Orange Bowl — and even as Georgia resumed looking like that towering machine with locomotive running backs, monster-truck defenders and otherworldly receivers. They bemoaned an overthrown Florida State pass just before halftime with the Seminoles trailing by 39. They had something of a bummer of a December, from   from the College Football Playoff to the Orange Bowl opt-outs of 25 Seminoles for the NFL draft or the transfer portal to the bowl game that ended in a 63-3 loss, but say one big thing for them. They’re real. Maybe it’s 42-3, but they’re still arguing calls. Reese Darlington, vice president of the Seminole Club of Los Angeles and Florida State Class of 2015, went next door for an ice cream cone. The vendor saw his Florida State shirt and exclaimed, “You guys got screwed!” Even clear out here, his club and the Prince O’ Whales bar have an entrenched kinship. It’s where you would go in Los Angeles to be among fellow ’Noles and for two beers and a cheeseburger for $11 to boot. The bartender tells you she has no affiliation to Florida State, but she wears the T-shirt anyway. Had the Orange Bowl had more pregame oomph and had the holidays not done their usual job of scattering people, the crowd on a Saturday afternoon might have approached the hundred or so for the Florida State-Louisville ACC championship game Dec. 2. “I’ve never seen it like that,” said club member Myles Blatt, Class of 2018. “We love this spot. They hold it down for us.” “I think it’s cool,” Darlington said, “to have a home base, here in L.A. Maybe if you don’t know anybody, some people, they just show up here.” When the Seminoles nudged in a 22-yard field goal after a great downfield catch by wide receiver Kentron Poitier, making the deficit 14-3, a person sitting in the outdoor portion could hear the little barroom singing just indoors: Once more, the great Los Angeles had presented different worlds on a given day: an inland one and a coastal one, a chilly one and a temperate one, a drizzly one and a blue-skied one, a staged one and a real one. By morning, in Pasadena technically, there came the media day for Monday’s Rose Bowl between No. 1 Michigan (13-0) and No. 4 Alabama (12-1), in a tinny giant tent, with the usual media-day frolics such as players borrowing microphones to interview teammates or reporters asking players which actors they would want to play them. Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh and Alabama Coach Nick Saban spoke before smallish crowds of listeners and large banks of cameras, and Alabama defensive back Terrion Arnold told of battles on the field but concluded with a giant grin that in the end, “I just want to be hugged.” They’re all in the “in” party, Michigan for the third straight time, Alabama for the eighth time in the 10 seasons of the four-team College Football Playoff. They are where Florida State and Georgia thought they might be, just before the final decision of Sunday, Dec. 3, when they got the unwanted numerals “5” and “6” as their rankings, while Texas went from 7 to 3 and Alabama went from 8 to 4. “Your dreams can come true,” Harbaugh started. “Your goals can come true.” “How is everybody doing today?” Saban said in his typical news conference opener. “First of all, Happy new year.” Way, way across greater Los Angeles through freeways and surface streets and over the Hollywood Hills, they watched a different side of the country and of the playoff. They watched the Grievance Bowl going on near Miami. The Florida State fans at Prince O’ Whales clapped for good plays. They hollered about the spotting of the ball at 28-3. At least one grumbled about a dropped interception at 42-3. They knew their team’s showing in its only loss of the season provided no justification of the hard, hard decision the 13-member playoff selection committee had to make. They saw the repeatedly televised sight of   — on the sideline, in his crutches and glasses, helping out, his injury a reason for the committee’s decision. They knew that what happened to them — besides the opt-outs of players such as edge rusher and team heartbeat Jared Verse and 50-catch receiver Keon Coleman and 906-yard running back Trey Benson and besides fresh injuries Saturday — was Georgia itself. Georgia had some angst, too, in its toppling from No. 1 to No. 6 after it   so that its 29-game winning streak ended and its national title run stopped at two. It looked gorgeous again. Running backs Kendall Milton (104 yards on nine carries) and Daijun Edwards (62 yards on seven) tore into vast open spaces. Wide receiver Dillon Bell (five catches, 86 yards) made sideline catches normal people couldn’t make. A trick play busted, so wide receiver Ladd McConkey, having caught the opening, backward pass, made a fierce set of devilish cuts 33 yards to the end zone for a 27-yard touchdown. Georgia looked bigger and faster. Florida State looked doomed after a breakthrough year. Just four Saturdays earlier at the Prince O’ Whales, Darlington and Blatt had finished watching amid a throng as the Seminoles weathered Louisville, 16-6, to reach 13-0. They had gone to their phones and researched Rose Bowl tickets. Now eternally nutty college football had given them something different, something no fans had known before even if all fans had to know it as possible: an unbeaten Power Five conference champion ranked an aching fifth after a thorny brain teaser of a committee decision. Now they had 42-3 at halftime, and soon they headed back in to watch more. “It’s not over yet,” Blatt said, smiling. “We’re a fourth-quarter team!” Darlington cracked.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/florida-state-fans-orange-bowl-cfp-snub/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 21:24:00,
"Jiang Ping, a Chinese legal scholar forced to resign a university president post after backing the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square but who remained an influential voice for the rights of citizens against the powers of the state, died Dec. 19 at a hospital in Beijing. He was 92. His death was announced by the China University of Political Science and Law, where he was a longtime professor and served as president for two years until being pushed out in 1990. Jiang Ping, a Chinese legal scholar forced to resign a university president post after backing the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square but who remained an influential voice for the rights of citizens against the powers of the state, died Dec. 19 at a hospital in Beijing. He was 92. His death was announced by the China University of Political Science and Law, where he was a longtime professor and served as president for two years until being pushed out in 1990. Mr. Jiang occupied an increasingly rare space in China, finding ways to question authorities over crackdowns on dissent and limits on free expression while maintaining a prominent position in a country where opposition voices are often silenced. “More and more people are genuinely interested in the fate of China’s rule of law,” Mr. Jiang said. He also conceded that the Chinese state has often moved in the opposite direction, including the tightening grip on power by . There was a personal stake for Mr. Jiang. In the 1980s, as China began to move past the purges and persecution of Mao Zedong’s  , Mr. Jiang was among four legal scholars who helped draft China’s first modern civil rights codes, which set basic legal principles such as due process in the legal system. But there were clear boundaries. Citizens, for example, still could not sue the Communist Party. Mr. Jiang also had a hand in helping set the foundations for China’s future economic surge, crafting the framework for laws covering property rights, contracts and corporate rules. The work established Mr. Jiang’s reputation as one of China’s leading legal experts and a mentor for generations of rights activists and reformers. “Bow only to the truth,” was among his oft-quoted axioms. Mr. Jiang decried censorship and indirectly chided Chinese leaders by asserting that the country’s economic modernization could not come at the expense of human rights and judicial accountability. Yet he did not cast himself as an impatient rebel. He believed that younger Chinese and future generations would eventually push leaders to accept more democracy and strengthen the rule of law. “We should have a spirit of tolerance, which is to say: To what extent can we compromise with reality?” Mr. Jiang said. “Don’t feel bad about compromising. Time will slowly change everything.” His ability to scold the system without incurring its full wrath added to his mystique in the eyes of his supporters. During the Tiananmen Square protests, Mr. Jiang was one of 10 university presidents who signed an open letter urging authorities to show restraint and open a dialogue with student demonstrators. He staged a personal sit-in at the gates to his campus in solidarity with Tiananmen crowds. In an oral memoir made public in 2010, Mr. Jiang described two attributes that he believed were essential for intellectuals in China. “One is an independent spirit that does not succumb to any political pressure and dares to think independently,” he said. “The other is a critical spirit.” Chinese authorities sent  into Tiananmen Square in early June 1989 to crush the pro-democracy movement. The following February, Mr. Jiang  as president of the China University of Political Science and Law, one of the centers of student organizing for the protests. Other university leaders seen as sympathetic to the Tiananmen crowds also were forced out. Mr. Jiang was careful not to make public comments after being pushed out as president and was allowed to remain as a law professor. A friend, however, described to The Washington Post   by Mr. Jiang at the time: “I’m maintaining my views,” Mr. Jiang was quoted by the friend as saying. “China must move toward democracy and the rule of law. … It has to come.” Jiang Weilian was born on Dec. 28, 1930, in Dalian in northeastern China. His father was a bank employee; his mother was a homemaker. He changed his name to Jiang Ping to protect his family from possible retribution during China’s civil war, which pitted Mao’s Communist forces against the rival Kuomintang, which was ruling China. Mr. Jiang left his university studies to join the Communist side in the war’s final years in the late 1940s. After the Communist Party gained control in 1949, Mr. Jiang and other students were sent to the Soviet Union to continue studies. Mr. Jiang was dispatched to Moscow in 1951 to study law. He recounted a pivotal moment in shaping his political outlook: hearing news of a secret speech by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev denouncing the earlier purges and mass persecution by Joseph Stalin. For Mr. Jiang, the shifting views on Stalin were evidence that power could be challenged and reevaluated. (In 1981, Chinese leaders   some of Mao’s brutality but declared that his “contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes.”) Mr. Jiang returned to China in 1956 to take a teaching position at the Beijing College of Political Science and Law (now China University of Political Science and Law). Soon, however, he was caught up in Mao’s sweeping enforcement of strict Communist orthodoxy. Mr. Jiang — like many professors, writers and others — was assigned to labor crews for political “reeducation.” His wife, a classmate he met in Moscow, divorced him under political pressure. While walking across a rail line with a load of steel pipes, he was struck by a train and one of his legs was mangled. He was fitted with a prosthetic leg that he wore the rest of his life. In the late 1970s, as China began its outreach to the West, Mr. Jiang returned to his teaching position at the university and later was selected to help create the civil codes and other legal statutes aimed at supporting China’s new market-driven visions. He grew increasingly critical of the overshadowing of the rule of law by what he called “rule by law,” the political leadership using the courts as a lever of power. “Because the judicial system is tied to the political system, if there is no real political reform, the reforms to the judicial system cannot be fully realized,” Mr. Jiang told Reuters in 2014. Mr. Jiang’s second wife, Cui Qi, died in July. Survivors include a son; a daughter; a sister, and two grandchildren. Even as China grew to be a global economic power, Mr. Jiang described the leadership as deeply insecure — relying on force rather than dialogue when confronted with demands for greater freedoms during Tiananmen and the uprisings in Hong Kong. “Democracy is best in supervision,” he  an interviewer. “We are always talking about improving the supervision mechanism. The best supervision mechanism is press freedom. … You can say whatever you have to say, and the leaders cannot suppress it. Free speech is the fundamental issue.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2023/12/31/jiang-ping-china-legal-dies/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 14:25:00,
"The Washington Commanders had a debacle of a week that started with one quarterback change and ended with another hours before kickoff. Washington appointed Jacoby Brissett the starter during the week, but   prompted the Commanders to start second-year quarterback Sam Howell against the San Francisco 49ers — four days after Coach Ron Rivera had benched him. The Washington Commanders had a debacle of a week that started with one quarterback change and ended with another hours before kickoff. Washington appointed Jacoby Brissett the starter during the week, but   prompted the Commanders to start second-year quarterback Sam Howell against the San Francisco 49ers — four days after Coach Ron Rivera had benched him. And then a strange thing happened Sunday: The Commanders played pretty well in the first half, competing with the NFC’s leader in a game that could’ve been wildly lopsided from the start. “I thought Sam had some really good moments,” Rivera said. “Early on when things were balanced, it was one of those things that the situation gave him an opportunity, and he performed, he really did.” But Howell threw a pair of fourth-quarter interceptions, and Washington  , to extend its longest losing streak in a decade to seven games. Imagine Howell’s week: He gets benched in the third quarter against the New York Jets, finds out Wednesday he’s been benched for the following game, then learns hours before kickoff Sunday that, change of plans, he’s going to start. “It’s a tough situation for him to just build confidence,” guard Sam Cosmi said after the game. From the start, Howell had little time to make something happen; the 49ers had possession for more than 12 minutes in the first quarter. Overall, Washington’s offense was limited to only 43 plays. But Howell quickly regrouped and kept his team in it with a pair of scoring drives. On the first, running back Brian Robinson Jr. picked up 18 rushing yards on three runs and added 22 more on a catch-and-run to help Washington to the 49ers 30-yard line. A 47-yard kick by Joey Slye got the Commanders on the board. Then, on the their next drive, Howell threw a 42-yard dime on third down to Terry McLaurin. “We kind of thought coming into this game they might play a little more man than they usually do,” Howell said. “We got manned on that play, and I think Terry against anybody in man coverage is a good matchup.” The two connected again in the end zone when McLaurin caught a three-yard pass for the score. Washington’s scoring drives tied the game at 10 with less than five minutes left in the first half. Yet the momentum was fleeting. Howell was sacked on third down to end a drive early in the third quarter, then threw interceptions to squander the following two drives. Howell completed 17 of 28 passes for 169 yards, one touchdown, the two picks and a 60.0 passer rating. “He’s already kind of quiet, so you never really know what’s going on in his head, per se,” McLaurin said of Howell. “... But I give credit to him because it hasn’t been an easy season for him. And obviously he’s going to get a lot of the blame and things like that. I think we all have a hand in it — the coaches, players. It’s been tough, but the way he came out in the first half, it showed resiliency. You could see a smile on his face. That made me happy because it’s a tough game, especially at that position. So I think he handled it as best as he could.” Rivera declined to name a starting quarterback for Week 18, when the Commanders host the Dallas Cowboys in a game that will have draft order implications for Washington and playoff stakes for the Cowboys. “Obviously an interesting week,” Howell said. “Wasn’t expecting until two hours before the game to have to play today, but … every single opportunity I get, I try to go out there and give it my all and make the most of it.” Washington’s 15-play opening script included pass, pass, pass — a formula that, perhaps unsurprisingly, faltered. Howell was coming off a rough stretch, so throwing repeatedly against the 49ers’ defense was an interesting choice to start. But the Commanders quickly reset and found the spark they needed when Robinson, who returned after missing four games because of a hamstring injury, burst up the middle of the field on second and nine for a 12-yard run, then took a screen pass 22 yards, breaking multiple tackles along the way. “We got a lot of respect for Robinson,” 49ers defensive back Isaiah Oliver said. “I think he showed today that he’s one of the best running backs in the league. Definitely one of the best running backs we’ve faced all year.” Robinson’s early success took some of the burden off Howell and prompted offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy to get his backs more involved. In the third quarter, Antonio Gibson was the spark, turning a short pass into a 15-yard gain, then picking up 16 yards on a subsequent run. The two combined for 63 rushing yards — all in the first three quarters. Howell’s two interceptions in the fourth quarter left the offense only three minutes of possession time while trailing. The Commanders gave up 28 first downs and 408 net yards (6.0 per play) to the 49ers, including 184 on the ground. But it could’ve been much worse, given the circumstances. Washington didn’t have starting cornerbacks Kendall Fuller (knee) and Benjamin St-Juste (concussion). It didn’t have safety Percy Butler (wrist), and for much of the game it didn’t have backup corner Tariq Castro-Fields (shoulder). And later on, it lost Christian Holmes (concussion). Yet the Commanders only gave up two passes of 20-plus yards and allowed only three touchdowns on six 49ers trips to the red zone. On the 49ers’ opening drive, Washington’s front seven spoiled a short pass to Christian McCaffrey that resulted in a loss of five yards and pressured Brock Purdy to throw away the ball on third and long, holding San Francisco to a field goal. Then, in the final seconds of the first half, the 49ers advanced as far as Washington’s 1-yard line before being held to a field goal. And in the fourth quarter, linebacker David Mayo knocked back running back Elijah Mitchell for a loss from Washington’s 1-yard line on fourth down, ensuring the 49ers couldn’t expand their lead. “I thought the guys were really gritty,” Rivera said of his defense. “I thought they gave themselves opportunities. This is one of the better running teams in the league, and [we were] trying to contain it and keep it inside, not let them stretch, because their backs have great vision [and] make good decisions on their cutbacks, and we were trying to keep it as compact as we could.” The Commanders’ locker room was eerily quiet, much like it has been in recent weeks. Washington has been out of playoff contention since Week 15, and its slow trudge to the end of the season has been tough for all involved. “Losing kind of wears on you when you put so much into it, when you take into account the offseason and all the reps you take then and all the sprints you run and all the plans you have for all the success you want to have,” offensive tackle Cornelius Lucas said. “For it not to come to fruition, it just gets tougher and tougher each week. It kind of steals your joy at some points.” The silver lining for Washington is that its latest defeat, coupled with the Arizona Cardinals’ upset win over the Philadelphia Eagles, bumped it up to the second slot in the 2024 NFL draft order — for now. But that means little to the players whose futures aren’t guaranteed beyond next week. “Yeah, you have to capitalize on it each time you’re out there,” Lucas added. “That’s the difference. You can’t [throw] away your opportunities.” McLaurin took it further. “It’s definitely tough,” he said. “I mean, you want to be a part of something that is sustainable, and you’re winning and competing at a high level. They’ve got a great staff over there. They’ve got great players. You can tell that they love playing together. … I got to spend some time with a lot of those guys; like six or seven of them made the Pro Bowl last year. I really got to be around them, and it kind of reminds me a little bit [of] Ohio State … the kind of culture that they have and everything. You see why they have the success that they do. “When you’re going against teams like that, you got to play — not perfect, but you got to make the most of every opportunity. … You got to give them credit for building that team and for the players going out there and executing. Hopefully, I can be a part of something like that, but I’m just focused on myself, my world and my journey, and I’m going to keep working to be the best player I can be.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/31/commanders-49ers-losing-streak/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 19:44:00,
"NEW ORLEANS — Austin Travis Lane owns the bar, his parents so into the University of Texas that they named him for its city and the city’s giant lake. But the bar, El Cucuy, facing an abandoned warehouse and the Mississippi River behind it, was not really built for watching sports. It was a house — the house Lane lived in — before he turned it into a dimly lit spot and covered the walls with posters for old foreign films. There are two TVs (one in the corner inside, the other hanging by the Airstream trailer in the back). Out on the gravel patio, a plastic skeleton is slumped over a rusted motorcycle, neither moving anytime soon. That’s the vibe. NEW ORLEANS — Austin Travis Lane owns the bar, his parents so into the University of Texas that they named him for its city and the city’s giant lake. But the bar, El Cucuy, facing an abandoned warehouse and the Mississippi River behind it, was not really built for watching sports. It was a house — the house Lane lived in — before he turned it into a dimly lit spot and covered the walls with posters for old foreign films. There are two TVs (one in the corner inside, the other hanging by the Airstream trailer in the back). Out on the gravel patio, a plastic skeleton is slumped over a rusted motorcycle, neither moving anytime soon. That’s the vibe. But this being New Orleans, and Lane being a UT graduate, a guy who slipped into the Rose Bowl in 2006 without a ticket, putting him within screaming distance of Vince Young’s title-winning touchdown run, El Cucuy became the perfect place for Texas fans to rediscover themselves this season. It’s where they forgot about 5-7 in 2021 and all the scars of the past decade-plus — and started to dream again. “Make sure you write that there are two TVs,” Lane said Friday night, correcting an incorrect assumption about his capacity to host for football games. Inside El Cucuy, about 50 Texas fans filled every seat, laughing and toasting with the Longhorn Network on mute. Two analysts picked the “dark horse” of the team’s 2024 recruiting class. The party was thrown by the New Orleans chapter of the Texas Exes, an alumni group that would hold events on Jupiter if two Texas grads were doing research there. Now, here, they were all of 72 hours from watching their team face No. 2 Washington in the Sugar Bowl with a spot in the national championship game on the line. “Our little bar did its part this year,” Lane said, his mouth curling into a grin. “I mean, Texas football is back, right?” “Look, I’m so excited for Monday, but it’s not just that,” said Joe Diaz, president of the New Orleans chapter, floating table to table in a Texas version of one of those massive hats. “I’m really excited for all the games to come afterward.” There, Diaz got at perhaps the most important aspect of No. 3 Texas’s run to its first College Football Playoff: the timing. Whether Texas is back, whatever that even means at this point, is more of a meme than a barometer for the Longhorns’ outlook. But there are concrete reasons it was critical to go 12-1 with a Big 12 title and a playoff nod in 2023. First, Texas   with Oklahoma, pitting it directly against Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and LSU while  . And with the name, image and likeness (NIL) money in big-time college football, with the way it has turned recruiting and the transfer portal into a stream of full-on bidding wars, this playoff appearance — this chance to win it all — should rally an already generous base of donors, not to mention the sonic boom of merchandise sales. “I don’t think it could have gone better for them in the last year before they moved to the SEC,” said Mike Roach, a national recruiting analyst for 247Sports who covered Texas for seven years. “To have a win at Alabama, to be able to go into a College Football Playoff and play a team like Washington, they are getting that uptick while seeing what they are going to get year in and year out. They’ve always recruited well, even in their down years, but what this has shown: Steve Sarkisian, since he took over, has had a blueprint to build in the areas that matter. It’s a return to power, really.” Roach jumped right into another key point: After Texas lost to Alabama in the national title game in 2010, none of the state’s other top programs took full advantage of the Longhorns’ drop-off. Texas A&M, Baylor and TCU had their moments, though each left the window open for Texas if it could get its act together. That just happened to take a bit. Charlie Strong and Tom Herman, the coaches who followed Mack Brown, tried and failed. Then Sarkisian took over in 2021, the team stumbled to 5-7, and he has since landed three straight top-five recruiting classes (according to 247Sports). Quarterback Quinn Ewers, a Southlake, Tex., native, transferred in from Ohio State. Otherwise, Sarkisian reconstructed his roster from the trenches on out. The Texas One Fund, the donor-funded NIL collective that supports UT athletics, has a program that pays scholarship offensive linemen $50,000 annually for charitable work. “This all starts in-state,” said Bobby Burton, a Texas graduate and longtime recruiting analyst who covers the Longhorns on the YouTube show “On Texas Football.” “Of course, Texas has to get talent from elsewhere, too. But to be a true blue blood again, they had to dominate recruiting at home.” “Right now, especially after the season they had, going to the playoff, all that, I’d bet almost any top high school player in the state is dreaming of playing for the Longhorns,” said Tony Salazar, head coach at Westlake High in Austin, which has six players on Texas’s current roster. “And that’s not always a given. Texas doesn’t get to be every kid’s preferred school just because of the burnt orange and the tradition. That has to be earned year in and year out.” This was the first season Diaz organized watch parties at El Cucuy. They started small, maybe 10 or so people in burnt orange, those two TVs more than enough. But as the wins piled up, the crowds grew. Ten became 20, then 30, then for a few games, Diaz lost count. On Friday night, while the Longhorn Network replayed the Big 12 championship game, someone yelled when Texas scored its first touchdown. At once, a dozen heads whipped to the TV, their instincts not dulled by the margaritas. Then they laughed at the false alarm. They had seen it already, maybe sitting in the same seats. The next morning, on a raised platform inside the Superdome, senior linebacker Jaylan Ford dropped his head so fast that he almost smacked it against the edge of the table in front of him. But there was a smile on his face, laughter coming out. The question: What was campus like this season compared with just two years ago? “Man, it’s not even close to the same,” Ford said. “There has been blood, sweat and tears to get back, but the cool thing is the fans, the school, they felt all that, too. So they earned it just like we did.” Where did the sweat and blood come in? “Shoot, all those offseason workouts. The hardest ones.” And the tears? “The losses. The 5-7 year. But that’s just made this so much better.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/texas-college-football-playoff-sec/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 05:02:00,
"ST. PAUL, Minn. — The two decades Marc-Andre Fleury has spent in the NHL have passed as quickly for him as the airborne pucks that speed toward him in the net each time he takes the ice. Now the fourth goalie in history to appear in 1,000 games,   with Minnesota in a 3-2 loss to Winnipeg  , Fleury is on the verge of another lofty milestone in his 20th season in the league. He’s one win away from a tie for second place on the career wins list, a perch he could reach this week with fellow Wild goalie Filip Gustavsson on injured reserve. ST. PAUL, Minn. — The two decades Marc-Andre Fleury has spent in the NHL have passed as quickly for him as the airborne pucks that speed toward him in the net each time he takes the ice. Now the fourth goalie in history to appear in 1,000 games,   with Minnesota in a 3-2 loss to Winnipeg  , Fleury is on the verge of another lofty milestone in his 20th season in the league. He’s one win away from a tie for second place on the career wins list, a perch he could reach this week with fellow Wild goalie Filip Gustavsson on injured reserve. “I feel very fortunate that I was able to play hockey for so long and do something I love,” Fleury said. “I think loving the game is something that kept me going through all the years.” Over 691 games with Pittsburgh, 192 with Vegas, 45 with Chicago and 72 and counting with Minnesota, Fleury has grown his reputation as one of the most personable and reliable goalies to ever put on the pads since the Penguins made him the first pick in the 2003 draft out of Quebec. Fleury has backstopped three Stanley Cup championship teams, won the 2021 Vezina Award for the best goalie in the NHL and, most importantly for his legacy, gained the unrelenting trust and admiration of his teammates along the way. “He’s a natural born leader,” Wild defenseman Brock Faber said. “The positivity he brings to the rink every day, that’s something I’ve never seen before. It’s truly an honor to be able to play in front of him and be a teammate of his.” Fleury has 550 wins in 1,000 games, trailing Patrick Roy (551 wins in 1,029 games) for second place behind career leader Martin Brodeur (691 wins in 1,266 games). The only other goalie in NHL history to play in 1,000 games was Roberto Luongo (489 wins in 1,044 games). Brodeur, Luongo and Roy all recorded praise for Fleury in a   the Wild assembled for him. His teammates let him take the ice for a solo lap to commence pregame warmups on Sunday. “The first thing that jumps out at you is just the quality person he is — his attitude, how he is around the rink, his ability to communicate,” said Wild coach John Hynes, who first got to know Fleury with the Penguins when he coached their AHL affiliate from 2009-15. “He’s still the same guy.” With his easy smile and fondness for locker room pranks, Fleury’s fun-loving disposition belies the intensity of his competitiveness on the ice. He has tried over the years to fight the temptation to smash his stick after a soft goal or a frustrating defeat, proudly noting in a recent interview with The Associated Press that he gave a stick away to a kid at the game in Edmonton instead of venting some anger on his equipment following a 4-3 loss. “I try to smile, get back to work and practice and move on. I find that’s how you get out of a slump quicker, if you always keep grinding,” said Fleury, who is 6-6-2 with a 3.16 goals-against average this season. “But still now, it’s not easy. There are some days when I want to break stuff, right? It’s still always a learning thing, trying to stay calm and composed.” Fleury was the subject of rare controversy when he broke NHL policy and wore a custom-made mask designed for Native American Heritage night   on Nov. 24. Fleury’s wife is Indigenous. The mask later sold at a charity auction for more than $35,000. “I was wearing a mask for 15 minutes in warmups. It was for a great cause, so to me it all made sense,” Fleury said. The two-year, $7 million contract Fleury signed with the Wild four months after he was acquired in a trade with the Blackhawks will expire this summer. He turns 40 on Nov. 28. The Wild have Gustavsson carrying a $3.75 million annual salary cap charge for the next two seasons and 21-year-old prospect Jesper Wallstedt waiting in the AHL. Though Fleury has refused to rule out a return, clearly disinterested in the fuss of a farewell tour, he has embraced with grace the league-wide attention that’s been paid lately to his games and wins milestones. “I do this because I love it. I feel very fortunate to play. I take a lot of pride in winning games and helping my team, and hopefully I can be remembered as a guy who had some success along the way,” said Fleury, who has three children between the ages of 4 and 10. “I can just go live a quiet life after this — no TV, no spotlight — and that’s fine with me.” ___ AP NHL: ",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2024/01/01/wild-goalie-marc-andre-fleury/f75dcae2-a8f5-11ee-bc8c-7319480da4f9_story.html,Washington Post,2024-01-01 17:34:00,
"U.S. Navy helicopters exchanged fire with Houthi militants from Yemen in the Red Sea on Sunday, U.S. Central Command said, in a marked escalation of tensions in one of the world’s busiest maritime routes that is part of the regional spillover from Israel’s war in the  . U.S. Navy helicopters exchanged fire with Houthi militants from Yemen in the Red Sea on Sunday, U.S. Central Command said, in a marked escalation of tensions in one of the world’s busiest maritime routes that is part of the regional spillover from Israel’s war in the  . The incident unfolded Sunday morning, when Houthi militants, in four small boats, approached the Singapore-flagged, Danish-owned Maersk Hangzhou and exchanged fire with a security team onboard, a Centcom statement said. After the militants fired on U.S. helicopters that answered a distress call from the ship, the helicopters returned fire, sinking three of the four Houthi boats and killing their crew members, it said. The helicopters, dispatched from the USS Eisenhower and USS Gravely, did not sustain damage, the statement added, and no U.S. personnel were injured. A Houthi military spokesman said 10 members of the movement were dead or missing. “It’s one of the most important, most vital commercial waterways in the world,” John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator at the National Security Council, said Sunday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “And we have an obligation with our allies and partners to keep the flow of commerce,” he said. The Houthis, an Iranian-backed militant group that controls northern Yemen, have been attacking commercial ships since October, in what the movement has said is retaliatory action for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. They have said that their maritime attacks — on Israeli-owned ships, or vessels headed for Israel — will continue until the siege on Gaza is lifted. Their campaign has coincided with strikes by other Iranian-backed militant groups, in Lebanon and Iraq, targeting Israel or its closest military and political ally, the United States. But the Houthis had refrained from directly confronting U.S. forces, even as the Biden administration took the lead in announcing the formation of a maritime coalition to confront the Yemeni militants. Sunday’s firefight appeared to be the first direct engagement between the United States and Houthi forces since Oct. 7, when   militants crossed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and seizing 240 hostages. A Houthi military statement on Sunday evening announced “the martyrdom and loss of 10 members of our naval forces as a result of the American aggression.” “The American enemy,” the statement added, “bears the consequences of the crime and its repercussions.” Sunday’s firefight came hours after another missile struck the Maersk Hangzhou in the Red Sea, according to  . While responding to that attack, which took place Saturday night, the Gravely shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, Centcom said, adding that no injuries were reported. Maersk said in an emailed statement after the second attack that it was delaying all transits in the area for 48 hours. It added that the Maersk Hangzhou had been transiting from Singapore to Egypt’s Port Suez when the attacks happened and that its crew was reported safe. Maersk’s decision to delay shipping Sunday came three days after it  , citing the security protection offered by the U.S.-led naval coalition. Other companies are now watching closely to see how Maersk proceeds. John Kartsonas, managing partner at Breakwave Advisors, a research firm focused on supply chains and shipping, said that if Maersk decides to extend its current pause beyond a couple of days, others in the industry would probably follow. In the wake of the Houthi attacks, many of the massive ships that carry some 12 percent of all world trade through the Suez Canal have changed course, set to travel the long way around southern Africa instead. As many as 12 out of every 14 container ships and a large share of oil and gas tankers bound for the key route between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea — which shortens the trip between Asian and European waters, and between Asia and swaths of the Atlantic, by thousands of miles — are instead heading south, Everstream Analytics, which analyzes supply chains, said in December. The incident Sunday underscored the risks to major shipping firms, whose operations have a rippling effect on the global economy, despite U.S. efforts to safeguard the waterway. “This is definitely an escalation that will change things,” said Robert Khachatryan, chief executive of Freight Right Global Logistics in Los Angeles. “There are a lot of vessels going through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal,” he said. “The military escorting each and every one of them is just not going to happen. And even if they are being escorted, they can still be shot at with missiles from inland.” Analysts say shipping rates were already on track to soar worldwide in 2024, for reasons that aren’t all related to the Middle East. Rates from Asia to Mediterranean ports have already jumped from about $1,500 per container in October to $2,500 per container now, according to Margaret Kidd, program director and instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology at the University of Houston. The risks, Kidd said, are intensifying at a time when shipping was recovering from the challenges of the pandemic, when costs of moving goods around the planet surged. The Houthi attacks have buoyed the reputation of the militant movement at home in Yemen and around the Middle East, amid widespread revulsion at Israel’s offensive, which has killed nearly 22,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the health ministry there. The Houthi attacks have posed a quandary for the Biden administration, in part because Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. partner, is trying to conclude a peace deal with the Houthis, seeking to formally end the kingdom’s military intervention in a long civil war in Yemen. The escalation of hostilities between the United States and the Houthis could upset those efforts. The Houthis “know the Americans don’t want to escalate,” because of the Saudi-Yemeni negotiations, said Mohammed Basha, a senior Middle East analyst at Navanti, a risk-assessment group. “They are in the sweet spot.” The movement, whose antipathy to Israel and Washington had been part of its ideology for decades, could decide to step up its confrontation with the United States after Sunday’s events, he added, including by targeting U.S. naval ships, like a destroyer. The White House has also faced pressure, from Israel and U.S. lawmakers, to more forcefully address the Red Sea threat from the Houthis. Rep. Michael R. Turner (R-Ohio), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that the Biden administration had been “very timid in responding to escalation by Iran.” “The administration continues to not respond to the Houthi escalation in the area,” he said. The White House was “going to have to look at operations into Yemen where the capabilities are resonant, where Iran continues to reload them as they attack commercial shipping areas and put at risk U.S. military,” he added. There was no sign Sunday that Israel’s military operations in Gaza — the stated reason for the Houthi attacks — were anywhere near their end. Early Sunday afternoon, Gaza’s Health Ministry announced that Israeli attacks had killed 150 people over the previous 24 hours, bringing the total death toll in Gaza since Oct. 7 to 21,822. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that the   “will continue for many more months” — echoing comments made last week by the Israel Defense Forces’ chief of staff — until “absolute victory” has been achieved. A member of his government, Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right finance minister, said in an interview Sunday that Israel should “encourage immigration” of Palestinians in Gaza, in comments that added to fears among Palestinians that Israel intends their forced displacement from the enclave. “The whole conversation about what will happen after the war will be different if there are 100 or 200 thousand Arabs in Gaza rather than 2 million,” he said, in an interview with Israel’s army radio.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/31/us-navy-houthi-red-sea-gaza/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 15:58:00,
"Chase Young pulled on a white beanie and sat down at his locker. He hadn’t been a big factor in the San Francisco 49ers’   on Sunday. He had played 26 snaps and registered two stats: one assisted tackle (on a short run) and one pressure/quarterback hit (on a 25-yard pass). Chase Young pulled on a white beanie and sat down at his locker. He hadn’t been a big factor in the San Francisco 49ers’   on Sunday. He had played 26 snaps and registered two stats: one assisted tackle (on a short run) and one pressure/quarterback hit (on a 25-yard pass). Young said his first game against his old team wasn’t emotional, but current and former teammates believed it meant something to him. San Francisco defensive end Nick Bosa said Young “really wanted to put on a good show” and that the 49ers “wanted to get him a couple sacks.” After the game, Young sounded disappointed. “Every game, I feel like I could play better. This one, I feel like I definitely could’ve played better,” he said. “Wish [Commanders quarterback Sam Howell] would’ve held the ball a little bit more. But, you know, it’s all good. We did our jobs. We did everything we do to get the W.” In the locker room, Young didn’t seem interested in dwelling on what happened in Washington, where he had once looked like a franchise cornerstone. He seemed to be enjoying the moment, which, for the 49ers, was pretty good: The Arizona Cardinals upset the Philadelphia Eagles and helped San Francisco clinch the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. But Young and the Commanders are approaching a crossroads. Soon, Washington will move on from the regime that drafted the former Ohio State star second in 2020, and in March, Young will be a free agent before he even turns 25. The next few years will be important for both, though Young probably has more at stake than the Commanders’ new ownership group, given his talent, injury history, underwhelming production and finite playing career. For now, though, Young seems relatively happy as the third defensive end on a Super Bowl contender. “Love this team, love the coaches,” he said. “It was a blessing to come to such a great organization — just the history — and I’m trying to take full advantage.” Before the game, Young said it “felt good to be home.” He missed his dogs — his dad has been caring for them in Virginia — and he saw family members. The 49ers’ team hotel wasn’t far from where he grew up in Cheltenham. But Young said the game felt pretty normal. He greeted friends, helped lead his team out of the tunnel and saw his supportive parents in the crowd. He had been in the visiting locker room at FedEx Field before; the Washington defense used it during a preseason intrasquad scrimmage. During the game, Young mostly found himself matched up with Commanders backup left tackle Cornelius Lucas, who started in place of the injured Charles Leno Jr. Lucas said facing Young felt like practice because they had gone up against each other there for the past four years. That included some trash talk from Young, which Lucas said he didn’t really respond to. “I’m more of, like, a conserve-my-energy kind of guy,” he said. “I’ll get him riled up and let him talk, but I’m more focused on what I need to focus on.” After the game, Young talked more with Commanders players and coaches, including Howell, wide receiver Terry McLaurin and defensive tackle Daron Payne. Even though they shook hands, things still appeared frosty between Young and Coach Ron Rivera. They hadn’t spoken since  , and Young’s description of their interaction was brief. “It was cool seeing former coach,” he said. “Now it’s on to the Rams.” In November, after the trade, Young told San Francisco reporters that the 49ers’ team culture stood in stark contrast to the Commanders’, in large part because they expected to win every week. “It’s kind of that same thing at Ohio State,” Young said. After Sunday’s game, McLaurin said it was difficult to see the 49ers play together because they were talented, deep and having fun, in large part because they expected to win every week. “It kind of reminds me a little bit of Ohio State,” McLaurin said. In many ways, Young and McLaurin cut contrasting figures. They’re far apart in pedigree, performance and perception among Commanders fans. But the college that unites them has given them pretty much the same perspective on a franchise on the cusp of a new beginning — but with no guarantee the next era of football will be better than the current one. Back in the locker room, Young grabbed his two suitcases and wheeled them toward the door. He wasn’t happy with his performance, but he still had a chance to change things. He was, after all, headed to the playoffs.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/chase-young-commanders-49ers/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 08:00:00,

After keeping things close for a half, Washington did its part to keep pace in the race to the bottom for a better pick in next year’s NFL draft by losing its seventh consecutive game. While the Bears clinched the No. 1 pick (from Carolina) by virtue of the Panthers’ loss to the Jaguars on Sunday, Arizona’s surprising road win against the Eagles moved the Commanders up a spot, from third to second. With one week remaining in the regular season, Washington, Arizona and New England have identical 4-12 records. The Commanders own the tiebreaker for the second pick, which is strength of schedule, as determined by the aggregate winning percentage of each team’s opponents. The team whose opponents have a worse winning percentage is awarded the higher pick, and the Patriots (. 518) and Commanders (. 515) are neck and neck in that category. These are the games that matter for the Commanders and Patriots (NE fans should root for the opposite)   The Cowboys can clinch the NFC East with a win over Washington in next week’s regular season finale at FedEx Field. It might seem like sacrilege to root for anything but a Cowboys loss, but it’s important for Commanders fans to keep their eyes on the prize. A win could cost Washington prime draft position, so it says here you’re better off rooting for a Dallas win, which would extend the NFC East’s streak of not having a repeat division champion since 2004. Then root your face off for the Cowboys to lose in the playoffs in front of their home fans in a couple of weeks. Eric Bieniemy called three consecutive pass plays on Washington’s opening possession, which resulted in a three-and-out, but the Commanders’ offensive coordinator found his groove on his team’s next drive, and it carried into the second quarter. Washington marched 46 yards on nine plays to cut San Francisco’s lead to 10-3, with running back Brian Robinson Jr., who missed the last two games with a hamstring injury, providing a spark in the run game. Sam Howell led an 84-yard touchdown drive on Washington’s ensuing possession, which included a 42-yard strike to Terry McLaurin on third and two after a strong run by Robinson. Howell was 9 of 13 for 100 yards and a touchdown in the first half, and Robinson had six carries for 33 yards. McLaurin was more involved in the first two quarters than he’s been in weeks, with four catches for 61 yards. Trailing 20-10, the Commanders were deep in San Francisco territory early in the fourth quarter when Howell threw a pass behind McLaurin that 49ers cornerback Charvarius Ward intercepted. After San Francisco marched 95 yards for a touchdown that effectively put the game out of reach, Howell threw his second pick on the second play of Washington’s next possession. The turnovers marred what had been a solid game from Howell against one of the league’s better defenses. Howell has now thrown at least one interception in six consecutive games. The second-year pro has three touchdown passes and 10 picks during that span. BIG INT for Lil Mooney 🗜   on FOX NFL+ //    Sunday’s final score would’ve been a lot uglier if not for Washington’s bend-but-don’t-break defense. The 49ers penetrated the red zone on three of their four first-half possessions but scored only one touchdown on those drives. Late in the second quarter, Daron Payne dragged Christian McCaffrey down for a loss of three yards on first and goal from the Washington 1. After the Commanders forced Brock Purdy to throw consecutive incompletions on the next two plays, the 49ers settled for a 22-yard field goal by Jake Moody. The outcome of the game was no longer in serious doubt, but Washington made another impressive goal-line stand in the fourth quarter, when Jonathan Allen and David Mayo stuffed running back Elijah Mitchell on consecutive carries to force a turnover on downs. All-pro left tackle Trent Williams returned to FedEx Field for the first time since Washington traded him to the 49ers in 2020 and led his teammates out of the tunnel before the game. “When they dealt me away for nothing, I still had a lot left in the tank,”   the 49ers clinched the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. With former Washington offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan at the helm and Williams leading the way, San Francisco has four playoff wins in the past two seasons, which is three more than the Commanders have since 2000. Benjamin St-Juste and Kendall Fuller were inactive for Washington, leaving Emmanuel Forbes Jr. and Tariq Castro-Fields as the Commanders’ starting cornerbacks. Castro-Fields injured his shoulder and left the game in the first half, forcing Washington to call upon Holmes, a second-year player who had appeared exclusively on special teams this year. Holmes made an immediate impact, breaking up a pass intended for Ronnie Bell to force the 49ers’ first punt of the game. Holmes’s day was cut short when he was carted to the locker room and ruled out for the remainder of the game with a concussion after collapsing in the end zone in a scary moment early in the fourth quarter. Washington failed to register a sack for the fourth time in its past five games.

"PASADENA, Calif. — In a parking lot tent overcrowded with media, Rose Bowl staff and the entire Michigan football team, Sherrone Moore roamed with ease. You saw the former offensive lineman in him. When he moved, the path cleared. He never had to stop unwillingly, take a side step or ask a person to make space. He owned a room with no room. Moore, the Michigan offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, has that kind of presence. So it’s no wonder that, during this strange and dominant season of chaos, the Wolverines often turned to his unruffled leadership. PASADENA, Calif. — In a parking lot tent overcrowded with media, Rose Bowl staff and the entire Michigan football team, Sherrone Moore roamed with ease. You saw the former offensive lineman in him. When he moved, the path cleared. He never had to stop unwillingly, take a side step or ask a person to make space. He owned a room with no room. Moore, the Michigan offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, has that kind of presence. So it’s no wonder that, during this strange and dominant season of chaos, the Wolverines often turned to his unruffled leadership. He’s not always as calm as he appeared Saturday morning. But even when his passion starts bubbling, he maintains an intense focus. For a Michigan team easy to villainize because of its   and polarizing coach  , Moore represents a different side of the Wolverines. He’s a window into their authenticity. It can be hard to determine what’s real about Michigan. The elaborate, rules-flouting spying scheme of fired staffer   turned into a bizarre running football crime this season, and for all of his obvious guilt, the depth of the misconduct throughout the program remains an ongoing investigation. There are questions that might stay forever muddled in speculation. Who all knew? How much did sign stealing and illegal scouting benefit the program the past three years? Should we resist reason, due process and compartmentalization and simply shout down Michigan without restraint for such a disturbingly bold breach of the game’s integrity? Competition couldn’t solve any of these problems. Stalions orchestrated something fraudulent, but it’s not accurate to dismiss the Wolverines as complete frauds. After the spying sins became public and the Big Ten punished the program by suspending Harbaugh for three games, Michigan played its best football, presumably without any improperly acquired inside information. Moore served as the head coach in those games, and Michigan won all three — over top-10 rivals Penn State and Ohio State and at Maryland, which just completed an 8-5 season. The Wolverines are 13-0 and the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff, where they will play No. 4 Alabama (12-1) in the Rose Bowl on Monday. They did this with Harbaugh missing from the sideline for nearly half the season. Before the Big Ten ban, he sat out the first three games of the year in a university-imposed punishment in response to alleged NCAA violations during the covid-19 dead period. In all, Moore managed the team for four of the six games without Harbaugh. “He has more top 10 wins than head coaches who have been head coaches for a long time,” running back Blake Corum said of Moore. “I would give him a lot of credit, being able to come in, showing the nature of our team.” If you’re ever in an embattled state, you want Moore on your side. He is unapologetically loyal. His commitment to Harbaugh and the program came out in an emotional burst on national television after the Nov. 11  . During a tearful and profane interview, he talked about winning for his coach and the entire university. He spoke at the height of Michigan’s defiance, less than 24 hours after the Big Ten had suspended Harbaugh while the team was flying to the game. Moore received criticism for his foul language. Others mocked him for crying about Harbaugh. It was the rawest moment of Michigan’s season. It was genuine. And it was a glimpse into a team that, though deserving of condemnation, is a complicated knot of bad, good — and laudable. Amid it all stands Moore, a 37-year-old who has developed into a glue figure and one of the best assistant coaches in the sport. On a staff full of exceptional coaches, Moore is a nice complement to Harbaugh. The head coach will always be the oddest ball in the bag, hanging out in his chicken coop, referring to this controversial season as a “spiritual” journey and expressing his love for Jesus by saying, “He would have been a five-star player.” “This is a real ball team, and I just love it,” Harbaugh said. “Love our staff, love our players. Like Moses, I’m going to die leaning on my staff. I couldn’t have a better staff to lean on.” Harbaugh and the Wolverines are just weird, rebellious yet, um,  . Moore makes them a little less random. “He brings the juice,” said cornerback Mike Sainristil, a converted wide receiver. “He’s the juice man in our building.” During meetings, Moore holds a yardstick and whacks the dry erase board to emphasize a point. His energy is consistent and infectious. “He starts the meetings with energy — yelling, but for a good cause,” Corum said. “He’s not just yelling to yell. He’s yelling because he’s fired up. He likes the game plan that he’s putting in. Every play is going to score. That’s how he has you thinking. “He’s always hitting the board. He’s like: ‘Inside zone.  Tackle and the guard, they’re going to go here.  ” For six seasons at Michigan, Moore has helped Harbaugh refine an offensive system that mixes a smash-mouth style and classic pro-style philosophies with reimagined offensive wrinkles. This season, the Wolverines haven’t been as explosive, but they’re an efficient and punishing unit that meshes perfectly the most complete defense in the sport. They’re retro, but they’re still creative. “We’re not in a hurry to make a mistake,” Moore said. “We try to play a team game. However we need to play to win that game, we do.” Moore has emerged as a top-shelf head coaching candidate. If Harbaugh bolts to the NFL, Michigan may slide him into the top job permanently. If Harbaugh stays, Moore — a Kansas native who went from Butler Community College to Oklahoma as a player before his rapid rise in coaching — should be a coveted leader in next year’s job market. But he does need time to develop his voice. He created a stir last week when he brushed off a question that alluded to Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe’s comments about his former offensive coordinator, Bill O’Brien, advising that he switch positions. A reporter wanted to know what Moore, a Black coach, thought about the never-ending stereotypes that Black quarterbacks must overcome. Moore didn’t answer and instead drifted into a bizarre word salad that began with him stating, “Really, I don’t see color.” He talked about his White wife, biracial children, growing up in the safety of Kansas and living in some kind of supposed danger in New Jersey. It was easy fodder for both sides of a fractured nation to make sweeping generalizations about race. Some used it recklessly as a character study of Moore. In reality, Moore just wanted to focus on Michigan, same as always. Perhaps when he’s the boss, he’ll be more prepared and comfortable handling broader topics. “That’s just life, especially in these successful positions,” Moore said later. “But it’s not about me. It’s about these kids. That’s all I care about. Myself, how I’m viewed, people talking about me crying, people talking about me being a head coach — I can honestly say I don’t think about any of that. I’m just so, so ready for this game. I’m ready for each moment. There’s no thought process other than that.” With all the obstacles the Wolverines have faced — with all the things some adults have done to make their journey more treacherous — they have needed Moore’s singular mind-set. No matter what, he keeps bringing the juice. He keeps moving forward, unhurried and unbowed.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/michigan-sherrone-moore-college-football-playoff/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 05:30:00,
"For as many struggles as the Washington Wizards have faced, they rarely disappoint when asked to rely primarily on their offense. When defense gets to take a back seat, watch out — those guys can catch a rhythm and hoop, 6-25 record be damned. Friday’s 110-104 win over the Brooklyn Nets was a perfect example. It was a pick-your-poison type of game, from the opposing bench’s vantage point: Kyle Kuzma and Deni Avdija were focused and determined all night, Corey Kispert and Mike Muscala came off the bench and were hot from the three-point line, and guards Delon Wright and Landry Shamet were absolute pests. For as many struggles as the Washington Wizards have faced, they rarely disappoint when asked to rely primarily on their offense. When defense gets to take a back seat, watch out — those guys can catch a rhythm and hoop, 6-25 record be damned. Friday’s 110-104 win over the Brooklyn Nets was a perfect example. It was a pick-your-poison type of game, from the opposing bench’s vantage point: Kyle Kuzma and Deni Avdija were focused and determined all night, Corey Kispert and Mike Muscala came off the bench and were hot from the three-point line, and guards Delon Wright and Landry Shamet were absolute pests. Once the Wizards stopped fouling so much, they had everything under control — and were rewarded with a strong standing ovation from a holiday crowd at Capital One Arena. Avdija, who had his best game in a month, showed the Wizards’ confidence and comfort when he nailed a pull-up three-pointer at the halftime buzzer to put his team ahead one going into the break. He followed with a gesture to the court: “Count it.” “It was really fun to play today,” he said. “… We just made the right plays. Everybody was locked in today. We just did the right stuff, did their task, what they needed to do. I feel like it just clicked for us. … I can’t say anything better than that, honestly.” Even before Avdija’s theatrics, there were hints of Washington’s focus from typically down-the-bench players — third-string forward Muscala, in for the injured Danilo Gallinari (back), had a doozy of a second-quarter sequence in which he hit a three-pointer, had a block, caught the rebound and turned it into an assist on a Tyus Jones jumper. Bilal Coulibaly got the crowd excited with a strong driving layup near the end of the first quarter to cut Washington’s deficit to 24-21. A smattering of second-unit players closed a strong fourth quarter, too. With Jordan Poole and Daniel Gafford struggling to find a rhythm and in foul trouble, Coach Wes Unseld Jr. stuck with Shamet and Muscala until the end, and the Wizards flowed along undisturbed. Kuzma led with 26 points and eight rebounds. Avdija had 21 points — including three three-pointers, which tied a season high — as well as 13 rebounds and six assists. “Offensively, his thrust and pace downhill with his catch-and-go, his cutting — he was also able to find and create action once we kind of stagnated a little bit,” Unseld said of Avdija. Kispert had 15 points. Jones had 12 points and six assists. Mikal Bridges led the Nets (15-17) with 19 points while Nic Claxton added 11 points and 12 rebounds. Here’s what else to know about the Wizards’ win: The Nets didn’t exactly provide Teflon-tough resistance on defense — the Wizards shot 50.5 percent — but credit the home team for powering past a few key shortcomings with a willful team effort. Brooklyn outrebounded Washington 54-43 (including 18-8 on the offensive boards), had a 26-4 edge on second-chance points and made 17 free throws to the Wizards’ three. Gallinari sat out because of back spasms that first hit in the first half of Wednesday’s loss to the Raptors. Muscala was big in his absence, even if he couldn’t do much to bolster the Wizards’ poor team defense overall. He showed off a little flair in his offensive game by matching a season high with 11 points, including a pull-up three-pointer to give the Wizards a one-point lead early in the fourth quarter, and three smooth assists. “Mike hasn’t played a ton. He played 21 straight minutes,” Unseld said. “To his credit, that’s a guy who stays ready. That’s a tall ask of anybody and not just to be able to compete at that level but to make impactful plays.” Kuzma did more than lead his team to a win Friday — he was also awarded the NBA Cares Bob Lanier Community Assist Award for the month of November. He primarily won the award, the prize for which is a $10,000 check from the NBA to his charity, the Kyle Kuzma Family Foundation, for two events. In D.C., the 27-year-old was one of many from Monumental Basketball to hand out hot meals to residents of Wards 7 and 8 at a community event around Thanksgiving. In Michigan, his work focused on aiding incarcerated mothers. Kuzma surprised mothers at the Genesee County Jail in Flint with clothing and holiday gifts for them and their children Nov. 26. He also unveiled two newly renovated jail cells, dubbed “Kuz’s corner,” as part of more widespread efforts to upgrade the facility’s conditions, and has partnered with two programs that offer support and training to formerly incarcerated people as they reenter society. Kuzma spoke after the game about his desire to involve himself in jail reform and particularly with incarcerated women — a marginalized sector of an ­already marginalized population. “Jail reform is something that’s very interesting, and it’s not really looked at, especially for women,” Kuzma said. “… [The award] means a lot. I try to pride myself on being as good as possible and bringing good to this world. … It means a lot to me and my family, so it’s great.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/29/wizards-nets-kuzma-avdija/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 23:16:00,
"We’ve finally reached the College Football Playoff semifinals, with all eyes on the four teams still alive for a shot at the national title. Here’s how I think Monday’s big games will play out. We’ve finally reached the College Football Playoff semifinals, with all eyes on the four teams still alive for a shot at the national title. Here’s how I think Monday’s big games will play out. Michigan is getting the “ain’t played nobody” tag even though it’s untrue. Three of its past four games came against teams ranked in the top six of Pro Football Focus’s overall defensive grade, and the Wolverines won all three. Michigan averaged 5.31 yards per play  , a team that allowed 3.65 yards per play in its 11 other games. The Wolverines put up 5.63 yards per play  , the most such yards surrendered by the Buckeyes this season. And while Michigan slogged to a 3.33 yards-per-play average against PFF No. 4 Iowa  , it still put up 26 points, the second-most allowed by the Hawkeyes this season. Alabama has played four teams in the PFF defensive top 20. They lost to one of them ( ), trailed at halftime to another (at No. 19 Texas A&M),   (PFF No. 18 Auburn) and were outgained in terms of yards per play in another (PFF No. 17 Georgia). In that last one,   that everyone seems to be valuing a whole lot more than any of Michigan’s wins, the Crimson Tide edged the Bulldogs by three despite having a postgame win expectancy  , and quarterback Jalen Milroe had his worst passing day of the season, at least in terms of PFF grade. Michigan, No. 1 in PFF defensive grade and  , will be the best defensive team Alabama has faced this season. The Wolverines have the personnel to force Milroe into uncomfortable passes, namely intermediate throws of between 10 and 20 yards. Milroe has completed only 33 of 62 such passes this season — a 53.2 completion percentage that trails his overall percentage of 65.5 percent — and four of his six interceptions came on them. Alabama also has allowed 43 sacks this season ( ), with 13.1 percent of its snaps resulting in the quarterback getting taken down behind the line of scrimmage ( ). Michigan’s 32 sacks this season rank only 35th — the number was limited by the fact that teams run on the Wolverines  , given the circumstances — but the Wolverines’ sack percentage of 8.6  . PFF grades out Alabama’s defense as the third best in the nation, but Michigan has proved multiple times it can overcome that. The Crimson Tide has looked a little shakier against strong defenses, and the Wolverines have the nation’s strongest. I think they finally get Coach Jim Harbaugh over the hump and into the CFP championship game after two consecutive semifinal failures.  Michigan money line -122 Of the eight offensive and defensive units involved in this season’s CFP semifinals, Washington’s defense is by far the worst. The Huskies rank   in defensive success rate, and in three wins over Oregon and USC — the best offenses they’ve faced this season — they allowed an average of 35.3 points per game and 7.1 yards per play. While not quite as potent as either of those two Washington opponents, Texas’s offense is right up there with Oregon’s and USC’s,  , an opponent-adjusted measure of overall efficiency. Coach Steve Sarkisian loves to get his pass catchers open in space, and that could be an especially potent plan against a Washington defense with a Pro Football Focus tackling grade that ranks 107th in the nation. The Longhorns’ defense looks good on paper, especially against the run ( ). But the pass defense, which is ninth in EPA per pass, benefited from the fact that Texas’s opponents had to start a backup quarterback in six games this season. The Longhorns also struggle with tackling, ranking 86th in PFF grade, and is only a middling 53rd in PFF pass-coverage grade despite facing all those backups. This should play into the hands of Heisman runner-up Michael Penix Jr. and the Huskies’ passing attack, which averaged 343.8 yards per game to lead the nation. All of this is to say that I think there will be plenty of scoring here.  over 63.5",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/college-football-playoff-picks/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 07:57:00,

"Deni Avdija had another gasp-inducing buzzer-beater at the end of the first quarter of Sunday’s Wizards-Hawks game. But unlike Friday’s long-range heave, this one didn’t portend victory. Avdija’s running,  left him sprawled on the court and cleared most of Washington’s bench as his teammates ran over to celebrate what ended up being the most dazzling single moment of a 130-126 Wizards loss on New Year’s Eve. The only problem was it capped, instead of kicked off, a strong run from the Wizards. Deni Avdija had another gasp-inducing buzzer-beater at the end of the first quarter of Sunday’s Wizards-Hawks game. But unlike Friday’s long-range heave, this one didn’t portend victory. Avdija’s running,  left him sprawled on the court and cleared most of Washington’s bench as his teammates ran over to celebrate what ended up being the most dazzling single moment of a 130-126 Wizards loss on New Year’s Eve. The only problem was it capped, instead of kicked off, a strong run from the Wizards. The loss sent the Wizards into 2024 at 6-26. The Hawks snapped a four-game losing streak and improved to 13-19. What came after Avdija’s shot decided the game. Washington lost the second quarter 48-24, had half the number of rebounds as Atlanta did and gave up four critical three-pointers in that span. The Wizards’ team play was about even, or better, the rest of the game, but their dismal rebounding combined with Trae Young and Dejounte Murray’s aggression put the ball in Atlanta’s control far too often. When the Wizards did have the ball, their shooting wasn’t sharp enough to make up the difference. Avdija’s incredible bucket was something of an outlier — Washington had 17 three-pointers but took a franchise-record 53 attempts from beyond the arc. Kyle Kuzma shot 7 of 18 from the three-point line on his own, a franchise record number of attempts for an individual that resulted in a season-high 38 points. “A lot of times they were sagging off, a lot of teams recently have been kind of waiting for me to drive into the rim, just opening up for myself, really. Because I’m confident in my shot,” Kuzma said. Wizards Coach Wes Unseld said he wasn’t displeased with the quality of three-point looks, just that they didn’t look to create other action more often once it became clear the long-range shots weren’t falling. “A lot of those were great shots, as far as they were open, within the confines of what we’re trying to do, they were in the right areas — the corners — they were off of some type of action. Those in general are great,” Unseld said. “Now, reading the flow, if we don’t make the lion’s share of them, then we’ve got to get to the paint, get to the line, find a way to get downhill a little bit, put pressure on the rim.” Although the Hawks never led by more than 15, they never appeared to feel pressure. The Wizards trimmed their deficit to five when Daniel Gafford collected a rebound off a missed three-pointer from Kuzma for a dunk with 41 seconds left. The Wizards allowed the Hawks to eat eight seconds off the clock before Bilal Coulibaly sent Murray to the line; Murray made 1 of 2 free throws. A layup from Gafford put the Wizards within four, but the Hawks sealed the game with four more trips to the foul line. “I think we found a little bit of comfort and thought we were okay, they obviously got going [in the second quarter],” Unseld said. “Didn’t seem to have the same level of intensity as the other night, but to our guys’ credit, they kept playing.” Young led Atlanta with 40 points on 11-for-19 shooting and had 13 assists. Murray had 32 points, 11 of which came during that decisive second quarter. Jalen Johnson also racked up 11 of his 24 points during that period. Kuzma added eight rebounds and five assists to his team-high 38 points. Avdija had 17 points and 12 rebounds for his second straight double-double and Corey Kispert added 15 points off the bench. Tyus Jones had 14 points and eight assists. Even with all the Wizards’ long misses, the Hawks outrebounded the home team, 58-42.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/31/wizards-hawks-three-pointer-record/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 20:01:00,
"Dan Campbell took the aggressive coaching approach and went for the two-point conversion to beat the Dallas Cowboys in the closing seconds Saturday night in Arlington, Tex.

Dan Campbell took the aggressive coaching approach and went for the two-point conversion to beat the Dallas Cowboys in the closing seconds Saturday night in Arlington, Tex. And then he doubled down on it. And then he tripled down on it. It didn’t work out for the Detroit Lions or their ultra-daring coach. The Lions failed on that two-point conversion attempt in confusing and controversial fashion when an initially successful try on a gadget play was disallowed by the officials, and lost to the Cowboys, 20-19, in a clash between playoff-bound NFC teams. “I told the offense that we were going down, 1:41 left, we were going to go down and score and then we were going to go for two and finish this game out,” Campbell told reporters after the game. “I told them that. And so that’s what we were doing.” The intrigue and chaos began when the Lions pulled to within a point on quarterback Jared Goff’s 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown with 23 seconds remaining. There was no hesitation by Campbell, who left his offense on the field seeking a potential game-winning two-point conversion instead of a tying extra point to send the game to overtime. The Lions appeared to convert on a gadget play, with Goff completing a pass in the end zone to offensive tackle Taylor Decker. But the officials disallowed the conversion, penalizing Decker for illegal touching of a forward pass, saying had not reported to referee Brad Allen as an eligible receiver before the play. Campbell said he was told by the officials that another offensive lineman who came on the field for the play, Dan Skipper, reported as an eligible receiver for the play and that Decker did not. “The explanation was, ‘[No.] 70 reported,’ ” Campbell said, referring to Skipper. Asked whether Decker actually had reported as an eligible receiver, Campbell said: “Yes.” Campbell, referring to Decker by his jersey No. 68, also said: “Two people can’t report. I don’t want to talk about it, all right? I explained everything pregame to a T. Okay? I did that. [No.] 70 reported …. [No.] 68 didn’t …. That was the explanation.” ESPN just showed another angle. Jared Goff literally sends Taylor Decker and tells him to report as eligible. I mean…. Wow.    But John Parry, the former NFL referee who is ESPN’s rules analyst, said on the network’s postgame show: “Two is not the issue. The issue here tonight is: Did Brad Allen hear? Did Brad Allen recognize visually or verbally with No. 68? I don’t think he does. I think he sees [No.] 70 come off the sideline, follows him all the way in. I’m guessing that Brad Allen, based on his mannerisms, his eyes, where his hat is [pointed], never recognized him.” Allen said   that Skipper “reported to me as eligible.” Allen said that Decker “did not report.” Allen also said, “So the issue is number 70 did report, number 68 did not.” He added that he informed the Cowboys defense that Skipper had reported as an eligible receiver. Replays showed both Skipper and Decker approaching Allen before the play. Parry said the eligible-receiver designation is not reviewable by instant replay and it is the player’s responsibility to make certain the referee knows that he is reporting as an eligible receiver. “I think in this case when you watch Brad and his movements and him focusing on No. 70,” Parry said, “I don’t think Decker … and Brad Allen ever connected …. Absolutely it is on the player. It’s a unique play. It’s a gadget play. You want to make sure that the referee definitely knows what position you’re playing.” Goff   that he was “pretty confused.” Goff said he knew that Decker reported as an eligible receiver and that Skipper did not. The five-yard penalty on the Lions backed them up to the 7-yard line. Even then, Campbell did not change his mind and kick the extra point. “We were going for the win,” Campbell said. Coach Campbell on the end of the game.  The Lions failed again on an incomplete pass thrown by Goff, but the Cowboys were penalized for pass rusher Micah Parsons being offside. With the ball at the 3-yard line for their third attempt, the Lions failed for good when another pass by Goff fell incomplete. “Would you be frustrated right now?” Campbell asked a reporter at his postgame news conference. “I don’t like losing …. And that’s what happened. We lost. That bothers me, you know. That bothers me. I don’t like having an L. So that’s the frustration. I’m sorry. I don’t mean it at you.” The Cowboys ended a two-game losing streak and extended their home winning streak to 16 games. And they won on a night when they finally enshrined Jimmy Johnson, their former two-time Super Bowl-winning coach, in their ring of honor. “Rightfully so,” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said during a halftime ceremony. “Welcome to the ring of honor.” ""HOW 'BOUT THEM COWBOYS?!""

The NFL Players Association told the Denver Broncos in an early-November letter that the team’s threat to bench quarterback Russell Wilson if he did not agree to adjust his contract was illegal and violated the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and the NFLPA, creating the possibility that the union would initiate an arbitration proceeding or litigation against the team and the league. The letter by NFLPA attorney Jeffrey Kessler was dated Nov. 4 and was sent to the Broncos and the NFL’s management council. “It has come to our attention that the Denver Broncos recently informed Mr. Wilson and his Certified Contract Advisor that if Mr. Wilson would not renegotiate his Player Contract to relinquish certain salary guarantees, the Broncos would remove him from the starting lineup,” the NFLPA wrote in the letter, a copy of which The Washington Post obtained. The letter continued: “If the Broncos follow-through on the Club’s threat, the Club will violate, among other things, the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Mr. Wilson’s Player Contract and New York law.

Wilson   that the Broncos had threatened in late October to bench him for the rest of the season if he did not agree to adjust his contract and address an injury guarantee tied to a $37 million offseason payment. “They came up to me during the bye week, the beginning of the bye week, on Monday or Tuesday,” Wilson said Friday, “and they told me that if I didn’t change my contract, my injury guarantee, that I’d be benched for the rest of the year. … I was definitely disappointed about it. … The NFLPA and NFL got involved or whatever, I think, at some point.” NEW: The NFLPA told the Broncos in Nov. 4 letter their threat to bench Russell Wilson over injury guarantee in contract was illegal and violated the CBA, creating the possibility for litigation and arbitration against the team and NFL. Story upcoming at  .  Payton said last week that he’d made the starting-quarterback switch for football-related reasons, tied to attempting to win Sunday’s game. Payton said he was not involved in any deliberations with Wilson about his contract. Under Wilson’s contract, the $37 million payment becomes fully guaranteed in March. It currently is guaranteed against injury only. By sitting Wilson now, the Broncos may avoid the possibility of him suffering an injury that would guarantee the payment and make it more difficult to trade or release him in the offseason, if they choose to do so. Wilson’s contract would count about $85 million against the Broncos’ salary cap if they were to release him in the offseason, although that could be spread over more than one season. The Broncos acquired Wilson in a March 2022 trade in which they   and draft choices, including two first-round picks, to the Seattle Seahawks.

"PASADENA, Calif. — What a rare Alabama football season rat poison-wise. The usual fog of rat poison failed to hover and menace. The team could breathe freely to 12-1 and this Rose Bowl national semifinal Monday against Michigan with a paucity of rat poison but with a helpful helping of what its famed coach called “really good rat poison.” That phrase makes limited sense, so the other day Nick Saban unearthed a fresh term for the opposite of rat poison: “Wheaties.” PASADENA, Calif. — What a rare Alabama football season rat poison-wise. The usual fog of rat poison failed to hover and menace. The team could breathe freely to 12-1 and this Rose Bowl national semifinal Monday against Michigan with a paucity of rat poison but with a helpful helping of what its famed coach called “really good rat poison.” That phrase makes limited sense, so the other day Nick Saban unearthed a fresh term for the opposite of rat poison: “Wheaties.” “Rat poison,” of course, has become part of the parlance of the college football era because it’s the dynastic Saban’s chosen phrase for the kind of external noise that can imperil teams. “Rat poison” pertains foremost to praise. The ingestion of praise can sap concentration, motivation and, finally, celebration. Instead, this Alabama team knew the privilege of getting written off, after the previous two Crimson Tide teams dared to refrain from winning the national title, including the 2022 team that missed the College Football Playoff altogether (by two losses by four points) and the 2023 team spent the night of Sept. 9  , Ala., of all sacred places. Now here the Crimson Tide is, almost as if it can be beneficial to endure a 34-24 home thumping now and then. Almost. “Well, we had some really good rat poison early,” Saban said Saturday, and by that he meant the inattention and derision from other humans, a dreamscape for any coach. Then, seated on his perch at media day for his eighth College Football Playoff out of the 10 played, the world’s youngest 72-year-old man let on that he had noticed some people, who included Alabamians in angst, declaring him demised. “It was almost like Wheaties,” he said, “because everybody criticized us and said we weren’t any good and we were done and ‘Coach Saban is past his prime’ and all that. It was like eating Wheaties, breakfast of champions. That helped us.” Of course, rat poison and “really good rat poison” reach back through the annals of sports into last century and probably the century before that, with coaches and athletes long scouring the world for slights and insults and “doubters” that can help them get up in the morning with cherished spite. It’s just that Saban has carried on one of the greater all-time crusades against rat poison and in favor of “really good rat poison” or “Wheaties.” Had you happened into Alabama’s 45-23 home win over Texas A&M in 2018, then happened into Saban’s news conference afterward, you might have heard him conclude the session with an unprovoked plea toward gathered writers: “So I would appreciate if you would, you know, sort of look at some of the things we didn’t do well and write about that, so maybe I can show it to the players and say, ‘Look here, man: Here’s something you can do better.’ All right. See ya later.” More recently, by the time of   in the 2021 SEC championship game, “rat poison” had burrowed into the lexicon for long enough for Saban to give it a little twist. “You guys gave us a lot of really positive rat poison,” he thanked the listeners. “The rat poison that you usually give us is usually fatal, but the rat poison that you put out there this week was yummy.” His wife, Terry, joined all listeners in laughing. She is a learned practitioner of the art of spotting rat poison, and she can chip in when she senses it coming over the horizon. Cornerback Terrion Arnold, perhaps Alabama’s most loquacious player, told of this Saturday. First, he defined “rat poison.” “I define ‘rat poison,’ ” he said, “as buying into the media, letting all external factors affect the way you’re playing. And I mean, it’s sickening, to be honest.” So this form of rat poison also can sicken. Continuing: The rat poison of praise “would definitely be the biggest aspect as far as, there’s some stuff you can’t control, as far as, like, today I was looking at my TV and it was like, Michigan, talking about the game, talking about factors that can affect that. I can’t control that. I’m in my room watching TV. But if you go searching for, ‘Alabama should win this,’ or ‘should win that,’ and building your head up and clouding your head up with all those external factors that have nothing to do with the game, that’s rat poison.” And so: “I had less rat poison because last year,  , I deleted Twitter.” He laughed and later clarified that when he needs to say something, he downloads Twitter, makes his statement and deletes it again. “So after that Tennessee game, [fellow cornerback] Kool-Aid [McKinstry] and I, we got together, ‘This will never happen again.’ I deleted Twitter. I mean, they were saying [Tennessee wide receiver] Jalin Hyatt was cooking me [for his six receptions for 207 yards and five touchdowns], and I didn’t even guard the guy once. So, I mean, that’s just a testament to rat poison; I feel I’ve eliminated all that.” Eventually there came the Iron Bowl this year, a mind-altering 27-24 win on   with 32 seconds left, and so, “See, that’s where ‘Miss Terry’ comes into play.” That’s what they call Terry Saban around the program and state. Arnold: “Miss Terry said that after games like that, you can tend to be at a high point of your life, but we had Georgia the next week, so she said, ‘You have to still stay focused, stay locked in and keep the main thing the main thing.’ So that’s where she does a good job of echoing the message of being around Coach Saban for 50 years and just knowing how he thinks and how the mind works. Miss Terry, she’s a very subliminal person who really knows how to give those messages and really gets you to go out there and play your best.” He said: “She knows. She knows.” Defensive backs might hear about rat poison more because Saban, that former Kent State defensive back, coaches them. “It’s really the wrong information for your ears,” McKinstry said of rat poison. “I feel like sometimes rat poison can make you feel like you’re better than what you are.” Rat poison knowledge has spread, of course, to linebackers. “When you’ve seen stuff on social media about — people praise you, a lot of reporters praise you, stuff like that, you can get a big head,” said Dallas Turner, that frequent name in NFL mock drafts. “That’s when work ethic starts getting questionable and you get complacent and stuff like that, because people are praising about how good you are. You’ve got to come back to reality.” Now, having run free of stifling expectations from the environment, and having won out since Texas, and having forged its Auburn miracle Nov. 25 after clinching the SEC West division and suffering mild rat poison and underestimating the Tigers (as Saban told it Sunday), and having  , Alabama does enter a weather pattern in which keen eyes might detect some incoming rat poison. It’s a slight underdog against Michigan, but still: “So now, can we handle the success?” Saban said Saturday. “That’s the next question.” He elaborated: “There is a lot of rat poison out there when you have success and have people talk about you in a positive way, and you have to be able to manage that. I think just from a human nature standpoint, it’s much more difficult to manage success than it is when you have failures.” So, viva failure, and viva scorn, and viva getting written off, for if Saban’s team can cling to its Texas failure, it might even get a rematch nobody foresaw on the night of Sept. 9.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/alabama-rat-poison-rose-bowl/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 15:16:00,
"Rather than enter a new year facing the same old lineup fit questions and trade rumors, the Toronto Raptors sent forward OG Anunoby, center Precious Achiuwa and guard Malachi Flynn to the New York Knicks for guards RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley and a 2024 second-round pick, the teams announced Saturday. Rather than enter a new year facing the same old lineup fit questions and trade rumors, the Toronto Raptors sent forward OG Anunoby, center Precious Achiuwa and guard Malachi Flynn to the New York Knicks for guards RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley and a 2024 second-round pick, the teams announced Saturday. Anunoby, 26, has been a constant subject of trade speculation for much of the past two seasons as Toronto explored whether the three-and-D forward could mesh with all-star forward Pascal Siakam and 2022 rookie of the year Scottie Barnes. The experiment never truly paid dividends: Despite their long and rangy defensive identity, the Raptors (12-19) rank 17th in offensive efficiency and face the prospect of missing the playoffs for the third time in four seasons while also potentially losing Anunoby, who holds a $19.9 million player option for next season, in free agency this summer. Meanwhile, the Knicks (17-14) are tracking toward another postseason trip, and Anunoby should fit Coach Tom Thibodeau’s vision of a hard-working and physical defense. The seventh-year forward earned all-defensive team honors last season, and he is averaging 15.1 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.6 assists while shooting 37.4 percent on three-pointers. Achiuwa, 24, will provide frontcourt depth for the Knicks following starting center Mitchell Robinson’s season-ending ankle surgery. Flynn, a 2020 first-round pick, pencils in behind Jalen Brunson on the depth chart and could fill some of the minutes created by Quickley’s departure. “OG’s complete offensive game and ability to defend multiple positions will enhance our team on both ends of the court,” Knicks President Leon Rose said in a statement. “Malachi and Precious are well-rounded players that will complement the hard-working and talented nature of our group.” Toronto’s return package included two players who will play significant roles as the team seeks to craft a winning identity following its 2019 championship and the subsequent departures of Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet. Barrett, 23, is a Toronto native who was the No. 3 pick in the 2019 draft and is averaging 18.2 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.4 assists. While Barrett hasn’t flashed all-star potential during his five-year career, he inked a long-term rookie contract extension in 2022 and is under contract through the 2026-27 season. Quickley, 24, has a chance to blossom into the most important piece of this trade. The 2020 first-round pick was the sixth man of the year runner-up last season and has made a strong case for the award again by averaging 15 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.5 assists this year. The fourth-year guard will have a better opportunity to flash his scoring and playmaking ability in Toronto after his role was limited in New York playing behind Brunson, who is in the midst of an all-star breakthrough. Quickley will be a restricted free agent this summer, and the Raptors should be highly motivated to retain him after losing VanVleet to the Houston Rockets in free agency last summer. “Immanuel is a young, talented playmaker who we believe will provide a spark on both ends of the court,” Raptors President Masai Ujiri said in a statement. “RJ is a versatile wing who is, of course, well-known in his hometown, and seeing him in a Raptors uniform will be a special moment for our fans and for all Canadians.” The Knicks and Raptors completed this trade despite being involved in a lawsuit in which New York alleged one of its former employees illegally provided confidential files to Toronto while being recruited by the Raptors for a job last summer.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/og-anunoby-trade-knicks-rj-barrett/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 16:18:00,
"JERUSALEM — It might seem obscene to assess the mounting financial cost of Israel’s   while the bombs are still falling on the besieged enclave, when hundreds of Palestinians, on average, are dying each day — alongside smaller, but historic, numbers of Israeli soldiers. And yet, the economics behind the weeks-long assault have powerful implications for Israel, the Palestinians and the Middle East. JERUSALEM — It might seem obscene to assess the mounting financial cost of Israel’s   while the bombs are still falling on the besieged enclave, when hundreds of Palestinians, on average, are dying each day — alongside smaller, but historic, numbers of Israeli soldiers. And yet, the economics behind the weeks-long assault have powerful implications for Israel, the Palestinians and the Middle East. The cost to Gaza, while clearly devastating, has not yet begun to be calculated. About half of the buildings and two-thirds of the homes in the Strip have been damaged or destroyed, 1.8 million people have been displaced and more than 21,000 people are dead, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The Israeli economy has been damaged, too — and it is Israel more than   that will decide when the shooting stops. Some economists compare the shock to the Israeli economy to the   pandemic in 2020. Others say it might be worse. Since Oct. 7, when Hamas and allied fighters streamed out of Gaza to kill about 1,200 people in Israel and take 240 more hostage, government spending and borrowing have soared, tax revenue has plummeted and credit ratings look like they could take a hit. Gross domestic product will fall — from forecasts of 3 percent growth in 2023 to 1 percent in 2024, according to the Bank of Israel. Some economists predict contraction. The impact on Israel’s high-tech sector — the engine of the economy — is sobering. Many Israel Defense Forces reservists work in the tech sector. Every day they fight in Gaza, their employers struggle to continue investing in research and development and maintain market share. On Sunday, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, said some reservists who were called up to fight in Gaza would be returning home “to their families and their jobs,” at least temporarily. “This will allow significant relief for the economy,” he said at a briefing. Policymakers and opinion leaders are now asking: How will the cost of the war influence its duration? When will the government decide to declare victory, stop the fiscal hemorrhaging and resume efforts to grow the economy? During the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. leaders familiarized Americans with the concept of blood and treasure. Israel is spending treasure deploying an average of more than 220,000 reservists into battle over the past three months and subsidizing their salaries. Many of these reservists are   in cyber, agriculture, finance, navigation, artificial intelligence, pharmaceuticals and climate solutions. Israel’s tech sector relies on foreign investment. But that was diminishing even before the war, in part out of concern for the instability that investors believed the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had brought to Israel — notwithstanding Intel’s recent announcement that it is going ahead with a   in southern Israel, the largest investment in the country ever by a company. Not only does Israel need to pay for the reservists, the bombs and the bullets, but it is also supporting 200,000 evacuees who have been displaced from Israeli villages along the Gaza border and the northern border with Lebanon, which Hezbollah is bombarding daily. Many of these evacuees are being   in the north and south — at government expense. Many are traumatized. Many are not working. Tourism has flatlined. The Tel Aviv beaches and the Old City in Jerusalem are bereft of foreigners. Christmas   in the occupied West Bank were canceled. Construction, which ordinarily relies on Palestinian labor from the West Bank, has ground to a near-halt. Since Israel launched its assault to eradicate Hamas, it has suspended the work permits of more than 100,000 Palestinians. Exports are down across the board.   in the Mediterranean Sea were shut down early in the war but are now partially operating. Economists interviewed by The Washington Post estimate that the war has cost the government about $18 billion — or $220 million a day. Zvi Eckstein, a former deputy governor of the Bank of Israel and an economist at Reichman University, recently ran the numbers with colleagues and reported that the impact on the government budget — including decreased tax revenue — for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $19 billion and would probably be $20 billion in the first quarter of 2024. That assumes the war does not expand to Lebanon. Costs will skyrocket. A war that lasts five to 10 more months could cost Israel as much as $50 billion, according to the financial newspaper Calcalist. That would equal 10 percent of the country’s GDP. The war could end sooner — or not. The Biden administration expects Israel to pivot in the new year from high-intensity bombardment and fierce street combat to more-targeted assaults. But Netanyahu has warned that the war “ .” “The war will last for many more months,” he said Saturday. Ono Academic College professor  , formerly an economist at the Israeli Finance Ministry, says it’s important to understand the war’s ripple effects. There’s the cost of waging the war, the steep decline in economic activity and a resulting drop in revenue. Deficit spending produces borrowing costs, which will weigh on budgeting long after the fighting ends. Forty-five percent of Israelis acknowledge worrying that the war will bring them economic hardship, polling by the   shows. The Hamas attacks were a catastrophe, eroding the trust of citizens, businesses and investors in the government and in the military, economists told The Post. That trust will take time to win back. Economists speak of the modern Israeli economy as remarkably resilient. The country has fought regional wars on its territory in 1967 and 1973; wars in Lebanon and along its northern border in 1982 and 2006; a 50-day battle in Gaza in 2014; and two intifadas, or uprisings, in the occupied West Bank, which saw sustained fighting between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers. “In the second intifada, a significant part of the damage was caused by misguided economic management,” said Zelekha. “There was significant government overspending and a simultaneous tax increase. “The main difference between then and today is that back then, the government debt reached 100 percent of GDP, not 60 percent as it is today. Our current situation is much better.” Reserve duty, displacement and knock-on effects of the war have idled as many as 20 percent of Israeli workers. “Israel’s economy experienced a shock wave comparable to the peak of the covid-19 pandemic,” said Michal Dan-Harel, managing director of Manpower Israel, the country’s largest employment agency. “Significant portions of the economy came to a shutdown for nearly two weeks. People were in shock. Each day revealed the magnitude of the crisis, and discussions about normalcy, such as work or earning a living, became almost illegitimate.” The impact of reservist deployments has been especially dramatic, Dan-Harel said, because “the individuals are called up without knowing when they will return to work. … No one anticipated that people would be enlisted for a period of three months or more.” “For the last 25 years, Israel has run up the mountain with weights on its legs,” said  , a high-tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist. He was talking about the wars and intifadas — and more-recent challenges. The Netanyahu government’s attempt before the war to limit the power of the judiciary — which sparked massive, months-long protests — hurt international investment, said Margalit, a former member of the Israeli parliament. “The war is an additional blow,” he said. He’s pushing for an FDR-style New Deal to establish innovation, education and new businesses in the hard-hit north and south after the war ends. Very. The United States gives Israel $3.8 billion in military support each year. The countries share defense technology to give Israel a strategic edge over its adversaries. The United States also sells Israel hundreds of millions of dollars in bombs, missiles and shells. The White House is pushing a supplemental funding bill that would include $14 billion in aid to Israel in early 2024. The bill has stalled in Congress as Republicans and Democrats debate funding for the U.S. border. , an economist at Tel Aviv University and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, called the U.S. funding “crucial.” “We are talking about approximately 50 billion shekels [$13.8 billion],” he said. “If the expenditure on the war reaches around 150 to 200 billion shekels, it would constitute a quarter of the war costs. This is a hugely significant sum and also provides the American government the option to exert diplomatic pressure on us, which is a good thing, considering our government.” Zelekha added: “If we had to fund that ourselves, it would pose an even greater problem. Secondly, the very fact of receiving aid signals to financial markets that we have economic backing, which reassures the markets.” “We need to send a big thank-you to President Biden for this assistance,” he said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/12/31/gaza-war-costs-israel-economy/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 19:02:00,

"The Detroit Pistons finished a miserable year of basketball on a winning note at last by scoring a 129-127 victory over the visiting Toronto Raptors on Saturday night to end their record-setting losing streak at 28 games. The Pistons took advantage of favorable schedule circumstances and   to claim their first win since Oct. 28 and close the calendar year with a 10-65 record. Detroit (3-29) finished last season with a 7-36 record after Jan. 1, including a 2-21 stretch after the all-star break. The Detroit Pistons finished a miserable year of basketball on a winning note at last by scoring a 129-127 victory over the visiting Toronto Raptors on Saturday night to end their record-setting losing streak at 28 games. The Pistons took advantage of favorable schedule circumstances and   to claim their first win since Oct. 28 and close the calendar year with a 10-65 record. Detroit (3-29) finished last season with a 7-36 record after Jan. 1, including a 2-21 stretch after the all-star break. Cade Cunningham finished with 30 points and 12 assists to lead six Detroit players in double-figure scoring. Jalen Duren added 18 points and 17 rebounds, and he hit four free throws in the final minute to help seal the win during a chaotic endgame sequence. “I feel amazing,” Cunningham said. “Oh, man, I feel amazing. … It’s been weighing on us heavy everywhere we go for two months, which is unreal for it to have been that long. It was a long time coming. To finally get over that hump, we’re not trying to go back.” After a 2-1 start, the Pistons  , snapped their franchise record of 21 straight losses across the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons this month, set the NBA’s single-season record by   and then tied the league’s all-time losing streak record by dropping their 28th consecutive game Thursday. The Philadelphia 76ers previously lost 28 straight games across the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons, while the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers and the 2013-14 76ers previously shared the single-season record with 26 straight losses. Saturday’s long-awaited breakthrough followed a competitive week for the Pistons, who suffered a narrow loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday and then pushed the Boston Celtics to overtime before losing Thursday. Toronto (12-20) was playing on the second night of a back-to-back after losing, 120-118, at the Celtics on Friday. Raptors Coach Darko Rajakovic also was left with a shorthanded roster after OG Anunoby, Precious Achiuwa and Malachi Flynn were traded to New York in a deal that was officially announced just hours before tip-off. While the Raptors received RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley in the trade, they won’t be available until early next week. Rajakovic said the trade made for “a very emotional day.” With Toronto struggling to get its offense going early, Detroit took a 52-44 lead into halftime and then survived a strong push from Pascal Siakam to open the second half and held on for dear life during a messy closing stretch. The Pistons missed multiple free throws and committed a turnover in the final minute, helping the Raptors cut a 10-point deficit with 44 seconds remaining to the two-point final margin. But Detroit had done just enough to emerge victorious. After some fans had donned paper bags over their heads and chanted “Sell the team!” during recent losses, the Little Caesars Arena crowd enthusiastically cheered back-to-back three-pointers by Cunningham and Jaden Ivey that pushed the Pistons’ lead to double digits midway through the fourth quarter. Cunningham, the top pick of the 2021 draft, brought the crowd to its feet again by sinking a midrange jumper with 1:35 left. At the buzzer, Cunningham crouched with a smile on his face and Duren raised both of his arms above his head. Two fans seated behind the Pistons’ bench held yellow signs that read “Believe.” “It was: ‘Thank God. Finally.’ Guys were screaming,” Pistons Coach Monty Williams said of the postgame scene in the locker room. “I was almost in tears. I’m just so happy for our guys. … I think people may have thought they were okay with losing, but they came in every day with a great spirit. They wanted answers and came in wanting to learn and wanting to get better. We rarely came into the gym with a bad spirit. We always had our joy.” Siakam led the Raptors with a game-high 35 points to go with five rebounds and four assists. Dennis Schröder added 30 points and nine assists for Toronto, which lost for the fifth time in six games. “Everybody was a little bit down [after the trade], but we don’t use excuses,” Schröder said. “Detroit made it hard against Boston last game. They came out [tonight] and wanted to win.” Detroit’s historic losing streak had become a source of fascination across the NBA; the organization had entered the season hoping to compete for a play-in tournament spot with several recent lottery picks, including Cunningham, Ivey, Duren and Ausar Thompson. Pistons owner Tom Gores held a video call with reporters earlier in the month,   but said he had no plans to sell the team or fire General Manager Troy Weaver or Williams. Gores, the billionaire founder of the Platinum Equity private equity firm, purchased the Pistons for $325 million in 2011, and the team hasn’t won a playoff game since. Detroit is on pace to finish 8-74, which would set NBA records for the fewest wins and the lowest winning percentage (.098) during an 82-game season. “I don’t think there is the proverbial exhale,” Williams said. “We know we have a lot of basketball to play. We all just hugged each other. We were just happy. A lot of people are going to get some sleep tonight.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/pistons-end-losing-streak-28-games/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 21:42:00,

Now that a second state has decided to keep   off the primary ballot for his role in the   on the U.S. Capitol, there is increased pressure on the Supreme Court to act — and to do so quickly. Other states could soon follow the lead of Colorado and Maine, said legal scholars who have been tracking the issue, and there is a risk of a  , with Trump appearing on ballots in some states but not others. The Supreme Court could   whether Trump is qualified to run. “The court has to take this case,” said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston. “Super Tuesday is coming up [on March 5]. You can’t have this lingering. … You have to print ballots for absentees, overseas ballots, military ballots. We need a prompt resolution of this issue as soon as possible.” Last week, the   found in a 4-3 decision that Trump was “disqualified from holding the office of President” because he participated in an insurrection. Maine Secretary of State   (D) reached the   on Thursday, writing in her   that the   attack “occurred at the behest of, and with the knowledge and support of, the outgoing President.” The   has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Colorado decision, and Trump is expected to do the same as soon as Tuesday. Trump has said he will also soon appeal the Maine decision to state court. Both decisions have been temporarily put on hold while the appeals are underway, so for now, Trump is slated to appear on ballots in those states. Questions over Trump’s eligibility to run for president come as he faces criminal charges in federal court in D.C. and state court in Georgia for his actions after the 2020 election. The charges include defrauding the United States and racketeering, but not insurrection. The Colorado and Maine decisions have roiled the presidential race just as the nominating season is about to begin. Some Democrats have cheered the findings, while others have said they would be better off beating Trump at the polls than having him blocked from running. Trump has a large lead in the Republican primary, but his GOP opponents have rallied to his side, saying voters — not courts or elected officials — should decide who to choose as their standard-bearer. Florida Gov.   (R) said on Fox News that the Maine decision violated Trump’s rights to due process. A spokesperson for former South Carolina governor   said “it should be up to voters to decide who gets elected.”  , a biotechnology entrepreneur, said after the Colorado ruling that he would withdraw from the primary in that state if Trump isn’t allowed to run there. Former New Jersey governor   has said voters should be the one to decide Trump’s fate and said on CNN that the Maine decision makes Trump “a martyr.” Trump and his allies have cast the decisions as anti-democratic and politically motivated, noting that Bellows is a Democrat and all of the Colorado Supreme Court justices were appointed by Democratic governors. “We are witnessing, in real-time, the attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter,” said Trump spokesman Steven Cheung. “Democrats in blue states are recklessly and un-Constitutionally suspending the civil rights of the American voters by attempting to summarily remove President Trump’s name from ballots. These partisan election interference efforts are a hostile assault on American democracy.” Trump advisers say they are monitoring the court cases and decisions, but said they are not particularly concerned about the decisions, especially the one in Maine that hasn’t been in court yet. One adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue, noted that all court decisions thus far have allowed Trump on the ballot other than the decision by the Colorado Supreme Court. “We don’t love the Colorado ruling of course but think it will resolve itself,” the adviser said. Trump’s team expects the Supreme Court to take up the matter and they would welcome a ruling across the board, the advisers said. They believe their odds are highly favorable at the court. One person close to Trump noted that none of the states he needs to get 270 electoral votes are likely to take him off the ballot. Republicans in Maine on Friday said Bellows’s decision had generated only more support for the former president. “Shenna Bellows has kicked a hornet’s nest and woken up a sleeping giant in the state of Maine,” said Joel Stetkis, chairman of the Republican Party in Maine. “There’s a lot of people very, very upset that one person wants to take away their choice.” The challenges to Trump’s candidacy center on a provision of the  , which was ratified three years after the conclusion of the Civil War to guarantee equal rights for those who had formerly been enslaved. Section 3 of the amendment says those who engage in insurrection after swearing to uphold the Constitution cannot hold office. The measure was meant to  , but Trump’s opponents have argued he can’t run again because he urged supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell” when Congress was certifying Joe Biden’s victory. They have filed challenges around the country, to mixed results. The top courts in   and   allowed Trump to remain on the ballot in those states. Two dozen challenges in federal courts by a long-shot Republican   so far have gone nowhere. Many of the cases have quickly fizzled. On Friday, a federal judge in Virginia dismissed a case seeking to prevent Trump from running in that state after finding those who brought the case did not have legal standing to sue. The judge did not address the merits of their arguments. The decisions in Maine and Colorado have put pressure on the Supreme Court to get involved soon. The voters who initiated the Colorado challenge have asked the court to agree to take up the case when it meets privately on Jan. 5 and issue a decision by Feb. 11, a day before ballots will begin to be mailed to most Colorado voters. That time frame would be extraordinarily fast for the court but not unprecedented. “In   they ruled in three days,” said University of Notre Dame law professor Derek Muller, citing the decision that determined George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election. “Is it realistic that they could issue a decision by mid-February? It’s completely realistic.” The Colorado decision put pressure on the Supreme Court to act, and the Maine decision only amplifies it, Muller said. “It points out that the longer this lingers, the more uncertainty there is in the states as states continue to do their own things — and for voters, as they wonder, you know, am I voting for an ineligible candidate?” he said. At the same time, the justices may feel like they do not have to act immediately because the decisions have been put on hold. That means Trump will remain on the ballot while the justices consider what to do. Among the issues courts and elected officials have had to consider is whether Section 3 grants them — rather than Congress — the power to remove Trump from the ballot. They have also had to weigh whether Section 3 applies to the presidency, rather than only to other offices. If the Supreme Court were to find that Section 3 applies to Trump, it would then have to determine whether the Jan. 6, 2021, attack was an insurrection and whether Trump participated in it. Muller predicted the justices and Trump’s attorneys would be loath to wade into those matters. “I think they’re looking for the cleanest outs for the court,” Muller said. “And if you have to get into the facts — what was Trump’s state of mind when he was rage tweeting on January 4th, 5th and 6th? What was his state of mind when he was speaking on January 6th? … Those are messy. They’re fact intensive. They’re the most politically charged issues.” Conservatives hold a 6-3 majority on the court, and three of the justices were nominated by Trump. But the issues at play have not often been reviewed by courts, and it’s difficult to predict what individual justices will think of them, legal scholars said. Blackman, the law professor from Texas South College of Law Houston, said he hoped the liberal justices on the Supreme Court would see that “this is really bad for democracy … to have a couple unelected judges in a state saying, ‘No, you can’t vote for the candidate of choice.’” The questions the case raises are difficult ones, but he said he had trouble seeing Trump appointees siding with those who want to remove the former president from the ballot. “If any of the Trump appointees go along with this, I think that would probably end the conservative legal movement as we know it,” said Blackman, who has co-written a law review article arguing Trump cannot be removed from the ballot under Section 3. Michael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said the findings in Colorado and Maine that Trump engaged in insurrection are persuasive. Determining whether state officials have the authority to remove Trump from the ballot on that basis is a tougher legal question, he said. “It would be such an extraordinary thing for the Supreme Court of the United States to bar the former president from the ballot that they may want to find a way to avoid having to reach that conclusion,” he said. But they are likely to deal with the issue in some fashion, he said. Those who want Trump blocked from running again have targeted states where it is easiest to object to a candidate’s eligibility. Maine has   that allows voters to lodge objections with the secretary of state. Bellows held   on those challenges before issuing her decision — which was immediately condemned by many Republicans across the state. “Maine voters should decide who wins the election — not a Secretary of State chosen by the Legislature,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Collins, who at times has criticized Trump, defeated Bellows in the 2014 race for Senate. In an interview Friday, Bellows said she would welcome a review of the decision. “Under Maine law, my obligation is to ensure that every candidate placed on the primary ballot meets the qualifications for office,” she said. “I do not have the option of declining to assess a particular qualification just because it’s complex or perhaps difficult.” After the Colorado decision, local and federal law enforcement officials said they were   made against the state justices. Bellows said her office has also received “threatening communications” after her decision. “I was prepared for threats, and I’m grateful to law enforcement and people around me who have worked very hard to ensure my safety and security,” she said. Kerry McKim, chairwoman of the Hancock County Republican Committee in Maine, said the decision only cements Trump’s already dominant lead in her part of the state. “I know people who are on the fence about Trump as a Republican, but now, because of this, they want to see Trump prevail,” she said. “They’re angry that they made this decision, and she’s taking away their voice in the primary.” Billy Bob Faulkingham, the Republican leader in the Maine House of Representatives, said Bellows’s decision challenged the core notion of due process. “People are innocent until proven guilty,” he said. “Not only has Donald Trump not been indicted for insurrection, not a single person has been convicted of that. So to take someone off the ballot because of insurrection is pretty ridiculous.” But one of the plaintiffs in the case, Thomas Saviello, a former state senator who voted for Trump twice before leaving the Republican Party after the attack on the Capitol, said Faulkingham’s argument is flawed because Section 3 of the 14th Amendment “says you are involved in an insurrection,” not convicted of it. “It is a self-determining requirement. It is not one you have to be charged with,” Saviello said. Saviello acknowledged the lawsuit is in a legal “gray area” and said the Supreme Court “has got to step up” to resolve this issue “before it starts to fester.” Saviello said he left the Republican Party because of Trump’s behavior on Jan. 6 and how he has behaved since. He said he would probably have voted for him again “if he kept his mouth shut and acted like Al Gore” or apologized for not accepting the 2020 results.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/29/trump-ballot-supreme-court-maine-colorado/,Washington Post,2023-12-29 19:44:00,
"BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Ravens remained on a major roll, and quarterback Lamar Jackson tightened his grip on what would be his second MVP award with a passing performance about as sharp as they come. Jackson and the Ravens, looking more dominant by the week, ensured that the road to the Super Bowl in the AFC will go through Baltimore. The Ravens clinched the conference’s No. 1 playoff seed by beating the Miami Dolphins, 56-19, before a delighted crowd Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium. BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Ravens remained on a major roll, and quarterback Lamar Jackson tightened his grip on what would be his second MVP award with a passing performance about as sharp as they come. Jackson and the Ravens, looking more dominant by the week, ensured that the road to the Super Bowl in the AFC will go through Baltimore. The Ravens clinched the conference’s No. 1 playoff seed by beating the Miami Dolphins, 56-19, before a delighted crowd Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium. “I don’t know if I’ve seen a more impressive performance in a game,” Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said. “I’m not sure I’ve seen a more impressive performance in a season to date. And obviously we have a lot more to do. We have a lot of work to do in front of us. But this is a mature football team, and they understand that.” Jackson threw for five touchdowns and posted a perfect passer rating of 158.3. The Ravens extended their winning streak to six games and improved their NFL-best record to 13-3. They’re two games ahead of the Dolphins, who dropped to 11-5, atop the AFC standings with one weekend remaining in the regular season. Harbaugh now will have the option of resting key starters, if he chooses, in next Sunday’s regular season finale here against the Pittsburgh Steelers. “To step up and play the way they have and put an exclamation point on it — triple exclamation points on it — with a performance like this, pretty much a well-rounded, perfect performance like that after the opening bell… it says [a lot] about who they are,” Harbaugh said of his players. The Ravens will be the AFC’s No. 1 seed for the first time since the 2019 season, when Jackson won his first NFL MVP and the Ravens went 14-2 during the regular season. They promptly were ousted by losing a divisional-round game at home to the Tennessee Titans. Pat Ricard one-handed TD! And Lamar throws his 5th TD pass. 📺:   on CBS 📱: Stream on      These Ravens expect things to go far better as they seek the franchise’s first Super Bowl title since the 2012 season. They will have the conference’s lone opening-round postseason bye and home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. “We’ve been the underdog all season, even the offseason,” Jackson said. “We’d like to keep it that way and just keep that mind-set.” The Ravens could face the Cleveland Browns and quarterback Joe Flacco, a former Super Bowl MVP for Baltimore, in the divisional round, if the seedings hold. “We remember ’19,” Harbaugh said. “I mean, it’s not something we’re going to forget.” The offseason contentiousness of Jackson seeking a trade amid a contract dispute with the Ravens seemed like a distant memory Sunday. He threw two touchdown passes to tight end Isaiah Likely and one each to rookie wide receiver Zay Flowers and running backs Justice Hill and Patrick Ricard. That was part of an 18-for-21, 321-yard display of passing mastery. “His performance was even better than last week,” Harbaugh said. “He played really a great football game. I mean, he played a perfect football game in terms of the passing game. He was just on point.” Jackson added 35 rushing yards, although there was relatively little need on this day for him to display his improvisational genius. Even his teammates enjoyed watching the show. “I was like a little kid at the movie theater, except I didn’t have popcorn,” Ravens linebacker Roquan Smith said. “It was pretty sweet, man.” Ray Rice receives a loud applause at M&T Bank Stadium, where he is honored as a “Ravens Legend of the Game.”  The Baltimore defense intercepted Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa twice and sacked him three times. Tagovailoa did throw two touchdown passes in a 22-for-38, 237-yard outing. But the Dolphins, like all Ravens opponents lately, were overmatched. “It’s just staying consistent,” Tagovailoa said. “That’s what this league is about, is who can be consistent the longest. And we weren’t able to put good drives together for a long period of time. So we’ve just got to be better.” Tagovailoa left the game early with what the Dolphins described as an injury to his throwing shoulder. He said afterward that his shoulder was “good, just sore.” Miami pass rusher Bradley Chubb was taken from the field on a cart in the game’s final minutes after suffering a knee injury. The Ravens  , in a pregame ceremony. Many of the fans cheered as the team introduced Rice as a “Legend of the Game.” The team released Rice in September 2014, hours after video surfaced of a domestic violence incident in which he was involved. Rice was seen striking his then-fiancée, now his wife, in an Atlantic City casino and dragging her from an elevator. He has spoken to Ravens players in subsequent years about accountability. The Ravens were   Monday night over the San Francisco 49ers in Santa Clara, Calif., in which they staked their claim to being the NFL’s top team. Jackson won his quarterback duel with the 49ers’ Brock Purdy in lopsided fashion and became the clear MVP front-runner. ISAIAH LIKELY. Incredible catch and run for the   TD! 📺:   on CBS 📱: Stream on      But there was little time for the Ravens to savor that victory. This was a rematch of a thrilling game here early last season in which the Dolphins overcame a 28-7 deficit to beat the Ravens, 42-38. Tagovailoa threw for 469 yards and six touchdowns in that game. Dolphins wide receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle combined for 22 catches for 361 yards and four touchdowns. This time, Waddle was on the Dolphins’ game-day inactive list because of a high ankle sprain. There were frequent “M-V-P! M-V-P!” chants Sunday as Jackson and the Ravens took control of the game virtually from the outset. Jackson threw for 255 yards and three touchdowns in the first half alone. The Dolphins kept pace for a while. Each team scored an opening-possession touchdown. The Dolphins had to settle for a field goal after Hill bobbled the ball on what should have been a touchdown catch, not securing possession until he was out of bounds in the back of the end zone. The Ravens scored 28 of the game’s next 31 points. Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. made a great catch along the sideline, challenged unsuccessfully by the Dolphins, to set up a touchdown run by tailback Gus Edwards. How happy do you John Harbaugh is that the Ravens clinched the No. 1 seed in the AFC? (h/t  )   The Dolphins got a field goal, but the Ravens responded immediately with a 75-yard touchdown catch and run by Flowers. Smith’s interception of a Tagovailoa pass led to Jackson’s 35-yard touchdown connection to Likely, who made a superb one-handed catch, on a fourth-and-seven play. A long return of the second-half kickoff set up another Jackson-to-Likely touchdown, this one from seven yards. The Ravens never let up and continued a season-long trend in which they not only have beaten good teams but have dominated them. “I’m not sure exactly how to define it,” Harbaugh said. “But I think you know it when you see it, right? That’s pretty remarkable.... It’s amazing. It’s something that they’ll have for the rest of their careers…. But there’s a lot of work to be done still. And we’re looking forward to the challenge.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/31/ravens-dolphins-lamar-jackson/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 18:47:00,
"BEIRUT — The   has given Iran the opportunity to showcase the capacity of its newly restructured network of allied militias, demonstrating Tehran’s strategic reach while allowing it to keep a distance from the fight, according to members of the groups and military analysts. On any given day since the Oct. 7   assault on Israel, one or other of these militias has carried out an attack somewhere in the Middle East — and on some days several in different places. The Houthis in Yemen are targeting ships in the Red Sea; Kataib Hezbollah and other Iraqi groups are hitting U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria; and Lebanon’s Hezbollah is engaged in daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces across the Israel-Lebanon border. BEIRUT — The   has given Iran the opportunity to showcase the capacity of its newly restructured network of allied militias, demonstrating Tehran’s strategic reach while allowing it to keep a distance from the fight, according to members of the groups and military analysts. On any given day since the Oct. 7   assault on Israel, one or other of these militias has carried out an attack somewhere in the Middle East — and on some days several in different places. The Houthis in Yemen are targeting ships in the Red Sea; Kataib Hezbollah and other Iraqi groups are hitting U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria; and Lebanon’s Hezbollah is engaged in daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces across the Israel-Lebanon border. The attacks can seem random, but they are the fruit of a carefully calibrated strategy forged in the wake of the 2020 killing of Qasem Soleimani, leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force, to bring cohesion to the loosely formed alliance of militias — designated by Tehran as the “axis of resistance.” Although the groups seem unrelated — a rebel organization in Yemen; a guerrilla movement in Lebanon; and militias formed to fight U.S. troops in Iraq — they all have one thing in common: their loyalty to Iran, which arms, finances and inspires them, the members of the groups and analysts said. Together with Hamas, they constitute the main components of the “resistance” axis. “What these different elements have done, moving forward with these attacks, shows the strength of this proxy network Iran has established throughout the region and how much of a concern it is,” said Joseph Votel, the former Centcom commander who oversaw U.S. troops in the region at the time of  In interviews, officials associated with three of the main groups described a level of coordination previously unmatched in the nearly two decades since Iran began cultivating a variety of local allies as a way of extending its regional influence. Representatives of the militias collaborate and consult through a joint operations room that meets regularly, typically but not always, in Beirut, they said. No one group is in control, the officials said, and each has a degree of autonomy over what attacks to carry out in their area and when, according to their capabilities and local agendas. The Houthis, for example, have taken on the task of  , with a view to pressuring the international community to demand Israel adopt a cease-fire in Gaza. The Iraqi groups are targeting the U.S. bases in response to the Biden administration’s support for Israel. Hezbollah is firing at Israel to draw Israeli troops away from the Gaza front. At the same time, officials with the groups said, all of the actions are calibrated to avoid a wider regional war — suggesting that while the militias have autonomy on individual operations, their actions are designed not to conflict with Iran’s strategic objectives. “During the meetings we discuss updates and progress on all the fronts and how strategically the operations benefit each front,” said an official with Kataib Hezbollah, the biggest Iraqi group carrying out attacks. The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “Iran provides all kinds of support but when it comes to decisions and actions on the ground, the decision is ours.” Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah has played a leading role in cementing the alliance, as the most senior figure commanding the oldest, most successful and battle-hardened group, the officials say. Soleimani’s death had left the axis leadership in disarray. As commander of the international wing of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Soleimani almost single-handedly cultivated the militias, and in the process achieved a mythical stature that far exceeded his formal rank. Without Soleimani, rivalries erupted, especially among the Iraqi militias, whose overall leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was assassinated in the same strike as Soleimani. Nasrallah stepped in to mediate and began implementing a new strategy, which he called “unity of fronts,” and all the groups pledged to go into action in their respective areas should any one of them be attacked. The Gaza war is the first time the strategy has been put into practice. Nasrallah has emerged as a first among equals, the officials say. When he gave his first public address following the outbreak of the Gaza war, Iraqi militias gathered in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square to watch the speech live on giant screens. “We regard Hasan Nasrallah as the official spokesman for the resistance, one of its basic pillars and most important symbols,” said the Kataib Hezbollah official. “He enjoys the respect and appreciation of all Iraqi sides and we consider him an umbrella for all of us.” Votel recalls being concerned following Soleimani’s death that the Iraqi militias would lose the discipline imposed by their Iranian commander. Instead, he said, the restructuring appears to have strengthened their cohesion. “That they have become horizontal rather than vertical seems to be a strength for them,” Votel said. How much of a role Iran plays in directing the overall strategy “is the million-dollar question,” said Hamidreza Azizi, a former professor of regional studies at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University who is now a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. “In a sense, Iran both is and is not behind these activities.” Soleimani’s replacement, Ismail Qaani, has adopted a far lower profile than his predecessor, lacking Soleimani’s charisma and his history of personal relationships with the groups. Iran, as a result, has changed the posture of the Quds Force, to allow greater autonomy to local groups, while remaining their benefactor. But Qaani is very active behind the scenes, shuttling among the capitals of the countries where the militias are based, Azizi said. “Qaani is everywhere. He’s a planner,” he said. “But they deliberately want him to have a very low profile.” An IRGC official is present at most of the joint operations meetings, according to a person associated with Hezbollah who is familiar with the proceedings. But Iran is only represented as “one of all,” without playing a leading role, said Nasruddin Amer, a spokesman for the Houthis in Sanaa who heads the Saba News Agency. The strategy appears to be working well from Iran’s perspective. It has been able to assert its regional influence through the disparate attacks, without triggering the major conflagration that could put its militia allies at risk and potentially draw Iran directly into the fight, Azizi said. “Iran feels quite comfortable,” he said. “These groups can come together to defend its interests and have shown their willingness to not allow one of its members, in this case Hamas, to be totally pushed out of the scene without a response.” Whether the strategy will continue to work to Iran’s advantage is in question as Israel expresses growing anger at Hezbollah’s attacks along its northern border. “If the world and the Lebanese government don’t act to prevent the firing on Israel’s northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it,” Israeli minister Benny Gantz said last week, in a warning that Israel might launch a full-scale assault on Lebanon. Israel has also been stepping up its attacks on Iranian allies and assets in the region. On Dec. 25, an Israeli strike in Syria killed a senior IRGC commander, Razi Mousavi, drawing threats of direct retaliation from Iran. An outright war, however, would throw Iran’s strategy into disarray. But the militia officials say they are confident that their attacks are providing sufficient deterrence to both to Israel and the United States without escalating beyond the current level of conflict.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/01/iran-militias-gaza-israel/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 02:00:00,

Peters, a U.S. Army Reserve veteran and former Maryland Senate majority leader from Prince George’s County, died Saturday at the age of 60. The cause was complications from multiple myeloma,  , his family announced in a statement describing him as “unfailingly dedicated to his family, to his church, and to his community.” “We, his family, are utterly bereft,” the statement said. “We take some measure of solace in knowing the tremendous impact he had on Bowie, Prince George’s County, and the State of Maryland.” Peters (D), who left office in July 2021 to join the University of Maryland’s Board of Regents, was remembered by former colleagues as a dedicated, driven leader with a good sense of humor. “Doug was a dedicated public servant, decorated veteran, and loving father and husband,” Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said in a statement. “He represented the best of Marylanders. It was an honor to serve alongside him for over a decade in the Maryland Senate.” The two had just discussed Peters’s hopes to erect a monument in Annapolis to the Maryland 400, Ferguson said, in honor of soldiers who served with distinction during the American Revolution. Peters, who was a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1988 to 1998, was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for his service in Operation Desert Storm. He was elected to the Bowie City Council in 1998, then the Prince George’s County Council before joining the state Senate in 2007 as the representative from District 23. He was chairman of Metropolitan Archives, a small business that specializes in storage, scanning and destruction of documents, and held degrees from the University of Maryland and the University of Baltimore, his   states. In the legislature, he played a critical role in the making of the University of Maryland Capital Region Medical Center in Prince George’s County, funded projects at Bowie State University and the city of Bowie, and ushered in state aid to the county,   reported when he left office. In an interview with the outlet about his departure, Peters said he felt good about his accomplishments and was excited about the future. “No matter where I served, I only sought to help people,” he said. State Sen. Nancy J. King (D-Montgomery) said in an interview that she was “heartbroken” about losing a friend of decades. “You have lots of acquaintances in Annapolis, but you can count your really close friends on a hand or two,” she said. “He was one of the people I trusted most.” King said she had spoken to Peters about three weeks ago, adding that he sounded optimistic about his medical path and like the jokester who would dress up in silly hats and outfits to make her laugh. Peters’s dry, witty humor she adored left her feeling hopeful that he was getting better. “He sounded like old Doug again,” she said. King and Peters relied on each other for guidance and to get things done, she recalled. If he called her up passionate about an issue, she would listen. If she needed advice, he’d give “a straight answer,” she said. In addition to his humor and dedication to service, Peters had strong faith and was devoted to his family, King said. “He was a good, Christian man,” she said.

He traded troubled outfielder Alex Verdugo and acquired troubled outfielder Tyler O’Neill, missed out on a sorely needed ace in Yoshinobu Yamamoto, then traded Sale. Boston did agree to a two-year deal Friday with right-hander Lucas Giolito. In Grissom, Boston hopes to have obtained a piece of a future core. He is a widely respected infield prospect who was shut out by an established Braves infield. Grissom, who will be 23 on Opening Day, has a .287 average and a .746 OPS in 216 career major league at-bats.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/12/30/red-sox-trade-chris-sale-braves/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 15:26:00,
"Former president Barack Obama has released the songs that have dominated his music palate — reflective of many of our own listening trends — of this past year. This year’s 28 selections highlight artists who have climbed the charts, received Grammy nominations or driven their respective genres to the forefront of mainstream success. Former president Barack Obama has released the songs that have dominated his music palate — reflective of many of our own listening trends — of this past year. This year’s 28 selections highlight artists who have climbed the charts, received Grammy nominations or driven their respective genres to the forefront of mainstream success. Here are a few takeaways from this year’s list. Many of the artists on this year’s playlist have achieved global success, including Colombian reggaeton and trap singer Karol G. The first mention on Obama’s playlist was her song featuring Shakira, “TQG,” from her fourth studio album, “Mañana Será Bonito,” one of Spotify’s top streamed albums of the year, according to data from the annual  . American singer-songwriter Mitski’s commercial breakthrough and piano ballad “My Love Mine All Mine” also appears. It’s her first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at 26 as a single from her 2023 album, “The Land Is Inhospitable and So Are We.” Afrobeats artists Davido and Burna Boy — who have helped bring the genre to the forefront of global listenership in recent years and have been nominated for Grammys this year — are also featured. Other songs released this year, including Victoria Monét’s R&B track “On My Mama,” received   for the upcoming 66th Annual Grammy Awards nominations. Mexican singer Peso Pluma’s hit “Ella Baila Sola,” a collaboration with Eslabon Armado, was one of the top streamed songs, per Spotify data. The hip-hop artist   a style from regional Mexican music that includes a trap-infused approach to traditional   — narrative tales of heroism that are popular in Mexico. Rapper 6lack posted the list to his Instagram story. “I’m tryna picture it & i can’t lol,” he posted under the screenshot that highlighted his song “Since I Have a Lover.” “But thanks 44.” The 44th president of the United States is no stranger to sharing the tunes, books and movies that have captivated his attention throughout the years. He has featured artists from pop, country, folk, rock and more across   and   playlists. This year, he gave a few slots to musicians he’s featured before, such as Kendrick Lamar,   and Mitski. “America Has a Problem” originally appeared on Beyoncé’s seventh studio album, 2022’s “Renaissance,” and a 2023 remix featuring rapper Lamar made it on to this year’s list after a   for Queen Bey. The 2023 version doesn’t contain overt political references, instead interspersing references to technology, drugs and seduction. Obama’s 2022 list included Beyoncé’s “Break My Soul” from “Renaissance” and Lamar’s “The Heart Part 5” from his album “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.” Mitski’s “The Only Heartbreaker,” released in November 2021 and featured on her “Laurel Hell” album the following year, was on Obama’s 2021 set, preceding this year’s entry: “My Love Mine All Mine.” Emerging and lesser-known musicians made their first entries on Obama’s playlist, such as singer-songwriter  . “Younger & Dumber,” the first single from her second studio album, “All of This Will End,” made this year’s list. The artist shared her elation on her Instagram: “I can’t even believe this.” , whose alternative rock track “Joiner” made the list, was more succinct in her excitement, posting a three-letter response to Instagram: “Bye.” Obama also featured several artists in Afrobeats, an   that encapsulates popular music and styles from West Africa and the larger diaspora that infuses Afro-pop, Caribbean soca and American hip-hop. The inclusion acknowledges the genre’s rising success since the late 2010s. Nigerian-born singer Davido made an appearance with “Unavailable,” which features South African producer Musa Keys. The song reached No. 3 on the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart and was   for a Grammy in the Best African Music Performance category. Also on this year’s mix from the genre, which received more than 13 billion Spotify streams last year, are Burna Boy, Tems, Asake and Olamide. Some mainstream megastars weren’t included on this year’s list, including   and South Korean singer Jungkook.

It was unclear if Tepper was reacting to a play on the field or to possible comments from fans during what would end as a 26-0 Panthers loss. In a video clip that went viral Sunday, Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper appeared to toss a drink from a luxury suite in the direction of Jaguars fans in the stands at Jacksonville’s EverBank Stadium.

It was unclear if Tepper was reacting to a play on the field or to possible comments from fans during what would end as a 26-0 Panthers loss. A spokesman for the NFL said league officials were “aware of the video” involving the 66-year-old Tepper and would have no immediate comment. Team owners are subject to the NFL’s personal conduct policy. A video shows Panthers owner David Tepper appearing to throw a drink into the crowd at EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville. ""We are aware of the video and have no further comment at this time,"" an NFL spokesperson tells  . 🎥 c_honsberger on Instagram  The loss with one week to go in the regular season ensured that Carolina (2-14) will finish with the NFL’s worst record. That would give the Panthers the No. 1 pick in April’s draft, but the Chicago Bears own that selection thanks to   in which Carolina moved up to No. 1 in the 2023 draft to  , a former star at Alabama. While there were concerns at the time that Young, listed at 5-foot-10 and 204 pounds, was unusually small and slight for an NFL quarterback, Tepper   in April his team saw the quarterback as having “the highest probability of winning Super Bowls.” The early returns have been disastrous, both for Young and the Panthers. Working with one of the league’s least impressive supporting casts — in part because standout wide receiver D.J. Moore and other high draft picks also went to Chicago in the trade — Young has completed less than 60 percent of his passes for 2,671 yards, 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions. His 53 sacks taken are second-most in the NFL, and Young’s 75.0 passer rating entering Sunday’s game was the lowest among quarterbacks with at least 200 attempts. Young posted a 53.1 passer rating against the Jaguars, with an interception and six sacks taken, as Carolina suffered its first shutout since 2002 (per the  ).

"When the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Day, new laws kick in across the Washington region. The most immediately noticeable change might be the minimum wage bump across Maryland, where all employers will now be required to pay workers at least $15 per hour. But that won’t be the only change to the rules. When the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Day, new laws kick in across the Washington region. The most immediately noticeable change might be the minimum wage bump across Maryland, where all employers will now be required to pay workers at least $15 per hour. But that won’t be the only change to the rules. Though little is changing in the District itself, lawmakers in Maryland and Virginia passed more than a dozen new laws that take effect Monday and will impact people who live and work here. Among those changes are a slew of measures aimed at improving health care, including new requirements for medical insurers, measures aimed at increasing access to mental health counseling, and new protections guaranteeing access to gender-affirming care. At least 10 new laws passed in 2023 and one law passed in 2022 take effect on Jan. 1 in Maryland — many of them focused on improving health care and providing aid to residents living in poverty. Among the most notable changes is the minimum wage hike that accelerated the state’s efforts to improve pay for hourly workers by two years. The Fair Wage Act of 2023 increases the minimum wage to $15 for all employers across the state of Maryland on Monday  — a change that the governor’s office says   in the state. Maryland lawmakers also passed a half-dozen measures aimed at improving access to health care by placing new requirements on medical insurers. One of those laws eliminates cost-sharing for patients receiving diagnostic and supplemental breast exams. Similarly, insurers will have to cover the costs of screening for and diagnosing lung cancer. Some insurers will also have to cover biomarker testing. Another new law requires the state’s Medicaid program to cover medically necessary gender-affirming care without discrimination. Accessing prescription drugs may get a little easier for some patients under another new law in Maryland. Medical insurers must develop a process for patients to request an exception to a step therapy or fail-first protocol that requires patients to try the least-expensive drug available before advancing to a more expensive treatment option, even when their doctor recommends a more expensive drug. Those exception requests must be processed swiftly under the new law. Maryland legislators also took a whack at preventing spam phone calls. The new rules that take effect Monday limit when and how solicitors can place calls and subject violators to penalties under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act. A couple of new measures that will affect Marylanders in dire economic circumstances will also take effect Monday. New eligibility requirements for fuel and utility assistance programs kick in, making all customers with annual incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level eligible for assistance through the electric universal service program. Another law gives homeowners a nine-month period after the sale of an owner-occupied residential property before a complaint to foreclose can be filed. Monday is also the deadline for the Maryland Cannabis Administration to begin issuing the first round of newly granted adult-use licenses to growers, processors and dispensaries. These licenses are limited to social equity applicants who live in or attended school in Zip codes disproportionately affected by the war on drugs. In Virginia, most new laws take effect July 1, with the start of the state’s fiscal year, but a few will kick in on New Year’s Day. Among them is a measure meant to ease the shortage of mental health counselors. It allows Virginia to join a 20-state compact that grants reciprocal licenses to counselors from participating states. Another new law, meant to streamline adoption and foster-care placements, will allow home studies conducted by a local board or agency to be transferred to those in another locality if the family moves within Virginia. Health insurers in Virginia will have to cover the cost of hearing aids and related services to people 18 years and younger when recommended by an ear, nose and throat specialist. The law requires insurers to cover a new hearing aid for each impaired ear every two years, with costs capped at $1,500. Another new law in Virginia requires health insurers to give patients six months’ notice before dropping their doctors from their insurance plan. It also would require insurers to continue covering visits to doctors after they’ve been dropped from the plan in certain circumstances to ensure continuity of care. Pregnant patients, for instance, may continue care with their doctors through the postpartum period, and those with life-threatening conditions may continue with their providers for up to 180 days. With the new year also comes a change in oversight of Virginia’s medical cannabis program, with that function moving from the Virginia Board of Pharmacy to the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority. The pharmacy board will continue to license health-care providers who are eligible to prescribe medical marijuana, but the authority will oversee retail functions. There are no notable D.C. laws that take effect Jan. 1; law changes in the District often take effect in July and Oct. 1, the start of the city’s fiscal year.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/31/new-laws-dc-maryland-virginia/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 06:00:00,
"The day that made Aïcha Bonou N’Donkie into an international viral sensation started as usual, with the 18 year-old collecting firewood, cooking for her family and selling peanuts she’d grown at the market in her village in western Burkina Faso. When she went to an informal concert that February night put on by a one of her favorite DJs, Aïcha said she forgot about her work and everything else, her mind blank as she pumped her arms, shuffled her feet and shimmied her shoulders. “Aïcha, tremblé!,” the DJ belted into the microphone, meaning “Aïcha, shake!” The day that made Aïcha Bonou N’Donkie into an international viral sensation started as usual, with the 18 year-old collecting firewood, cooking for her family and selling peanuts she’d grown at the market in her village in western Burkina Faso. When she went to an informal concert that February night put on by a one of her favorite DJs, Aïcha said she forgot about her work and everything else, her mind blank as she pumped her arms, shuffled her feet and shimmied her shoulders. “Aïcha, tremblé!,” the DJ belted into the microphone, meaning “Aïcha, shake!” Aïcha, wearing a bright yellow T-shirt and blue skirt, looked at the DJ, Dominique Leosgo, smiled and closed her eyes. Then, as the music pulsed, she shook her shoulders, faster and faster. The shimmy would go global. Clips of her dancing, which Leosgo posted on his TikTok page, collectively got more than 8 million views, turning the pair into a sensation in their West African country and beyond. Aïcha and Leosgo, who goes by DJ Domi, made a  in four months, making it among the country’s biggest recent hits. They’ve traveled to Chad, Ivory Coast and France and been interviewed with   and journalists. Their second music video, produced by one of Burkina Faso’s top directors, was released this month. @💕zuzan🩵 @Ouagawordstarmagg  In the once-peaceful nation of Burkina Faso, which has in recent years been  , the pair has become a symbol of resilience and hope. Leosgo and Aïcha — who has no training as a dancer, never went to school and says that she “never, ever expected any of this” — say they are an example of the people’s determination to keep enjoying life, despite the violence. During a recent week in the capital, Ouagadougou, speakers at a government-sponsored panel on the role of media praised the teenager, boys on bikes chased after her car, and men and women burst into dance when the song started playing at a gas station. “We don’t want to lecture but to bring joy,” Leosgo said in an interview. “To help people to forget.” “Hand in hand, we’ll get through this,” Aïcha added. “I am sure.” Leosgo, 33, made a name for himself traveling the country performing at “bals poussières,” or literally, “dust shows,” a tradition in which artists arrive in often-remote villages with only their cars and their sound systems. Despite the growing militant violence, Leosgo kept performing, attracting enthusiastic crowds at performances with “no dance floors and no pretty lights.” On the night Leosgo met Aïcha, he was performing in the village of Sin. Two of Aïcha’s friends, Yacouba and Adama, had paid Leosgo for “atalakou” in which people pay artists to make songs about them. That night, the DJ was singing their names when he noticed Aïcha in her bright yellow outfit, shaking her shoulders. The move is traditional, he said, but he’d never seen someone use it quite like that in response to his music. “Who’s that girl?” he recalled asking her friends. “That’s Aïcha,” they responded. And so the refrain was born: “Yacouba, Adama, Yacouba, Adama … Aïcha, tremblé!” The clip only went viral months later. Aïcha learned about it when a friend visited her in the peanut field to show her the number of viewers. Aïcha’s immediate reaction, she recalled with a laugh during an interview, was fear. “I went home and shaved my head,” she said. “I didn’t want people to recognize me.” But when Leosgo and his manager returned to the village to find Aïcha, she was on board for the music video, and for whatever came next. People in the village used to tell her she was a funny dancer, Aïcha said. “But I always felt at ease when I danced,” she said. “So I kept dancing.” On a recent evening at one of the city’s fancy hotels, Aïcha and Leosgo were side by side, cracking jokes and dancing. Unlike that night in the village, they were now on an elevated stage, surrounded by massive lights and palm trees, with dozens of hired dancers following their movements. They’d gotten back from a trip to France about a week before and were filming their second music video. In the six months since the video had gone viral, Aïcha had made her first trip to Ouagadougou, the capital, then moved there. She’d traveled internationally for the first time. She’d started learning French and taking dance courses. She’d gotten a full wardrobe upgrade. She still stayed in touch with her friends from the village, including Yacouba and Adama. She still liked the same foods. And she still couldn’t quite believe how she’d ended up here. “For now I want to keep dancing,” she said, sitting near Leosgo and the rest of her team, who she said had become like an adopted family. “But every day has its end. And if God wants me to do something else, then I will.” David Armel, who directed the second music video, said their story had resonated so much in part because of how humble the pair has remained. “When people see her, they don’t see a country or an ethnicity,” he said. “When people see her, they just see a Black girl dancing, enjoying herself after a long day of work. And everyone relates to her.” Onstage, Aïcha wore the same shade of blue and yellow as before, but her worn T-shirt and skirt had been replaced by a snappy blue vest and pants and a bright yellow undershirt. She smiled widely, seeming at ease. “Move, dance, move, dance,” Leosgo sang, as the dancers below followed. Everyone was shimmying their shoulders, but no one quite as fast as Aïcha.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/02/aicha-tremble-burkina-faso/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 03:00:00,
"One week to go in the NFL season, and still so much to sort out. The 49ers and Ravens claimed the top seeds, four divisions have been clinched, and nine playoff spots have been secured. That leaves four division titles and five playoff spots unsettled heading into Week 18. Eight games next weekend will have a bearing on either who makes the playoffs or who wins a division. Here is what to know. One week to go in the NFL season, and still so much to sort out. The 49ers and Ravens claimed the top seeds, four divisions have been clinched, and nine playoff spots have been secured. That leaves four division titles and five playoff spots unsettled heading into Week 18. Eight games next weekend will have a bearing on either who makes the playoffs or who wins a division. Here is what to know. . Everything has changed in Green Bay over the past year, and yet the Packers’ first regular season with Jordan Love will end in eerily identical fashion to their final regular season with Aaron Rodgers. They only need to win in Week 18 to make the playoffs, and their opponent is a divisional rival eliminated from playoff contention but entering as one of the hottest teams in the NFL. The Packers put themselves in position to make the playoffs with a 33-10 victory Sunday night over the Vikings, built on the ineptitude of Vikings rookie quarterback Jaren Hall and an out-of-nowhere, 105-receiving yard game from Bo Melton, a 2022 seventh-round pick of the Seahawks who had spent most of the season on Green Bay’s practice squad. The win nudged the Packers to 8-8 and ahead of the Seahawks and Saints on tiebreakers. Last year, the Lions knocked the Packers out of the playoffs and ended Rodgers’s Green Bay tenure with an upset they used as a launchpad for their division title run this year. Next week, the Packers will have to go through another smoking-hot team with nothing to lose. The Bears may be 7-9, but they have won five of seven with quarterback Justin Fields playing the best football of his career and an aggressive defense that has become dominant since the  . Chicago destroyed Atlanta, 37-17, in the snow at Soldier Field on Sunday in a game the Falcons needed to stay relevant in the NFC playoff race. The Packers beat the Bears, 38-20, in Week 1 and are narrow favorites, but it will not be an easy game. The Packers moved into their strong position after the Seahawks’ costly, 30-23 home loss to the Steelers, who have been revived behind veteran backup Mason Rudolph. If the Packers stumble against the Bears, the Seahawks can earn the final NFC wild card if they beat the Cardinals on the road. The Saints stayed alive in both the NFC South title race and the wild card hunt by beating the Buccaneers in Tampa. But the Bucs can still clinch the South with a victory over the 2-15 Panthers. Assuming the Bucs win, the Saints would need a win over the Falcons and losses by the Packers and Seahawks to steal the last wild card. . One month ago, the Bills were 6-6 after an overtime loss in Philadelphia and buried under a heap of AFC wild card contenders. They have won four straight to surge to 10 victories and afford themselves clarity: If they beat the Dolphins on Sunday in Miami, they will steal the AFC East. The two teams will meet in the marquee Sunday night slot coming from different directions. The Dolphins were  , and suffered a loss even worse than the score late in the game: Pass rusher Bradley Chubb collapsed without contact and exited the field on a cart, and the Dolphins reportedly fear he tore his ACL. Miami already lost Jaelan Phillips to an Achilles’ tendon tear, making Chubb’s injury a potentially fatal blow to their pass rush and Super Bowl aspirations. The Bills crushed the Dolphins, 48-20, in Week 4 and enter on a four-game winning streak, even if the past two came in uneven fashion against the Chargers and Patriots. The Dolphins are 7-1 at home this year and have controlled the division all season long. . In a year shaped, if not defined, by quarterback injuries, Flacco has been the story of the season. He spent much of the fall tossing passes to his five kids at home, hoping a needy team would summon him. As the season winds down, it would not be a surprise if he were to land at the bottom of a few MVP ballots. Flacco, the Browns’ fourth quarterback of the season, has been the king of the backups. He played breathtaking football against one of the best pass defenses in the NFL on Thursday night, leading the Browns to a 34-point first half as they clobbered the Jets, 37-20, improved to 11-5 and clinched a playoff spot. Flacco threw for 309 yards even as top wideout Amari Cooper sat with an injury. The Browns are 4-1 since Flacco fell out of the sky, started slinging missiles and saved their season. He has passed for at least 300 yards in four consecutive games, an outrageous accomplishment for a 38-year-old quarterback whose last full season as a starter came in 2017. But Flacco’s unmatched arm strength and fearlessness throwing downfield has been an ideal fit in Coach Kevin Stefanski’s play-action heavy system. At 11-5, the Browns are locked into the 5 seed, which means they can use Week 18 as a bye week if they want. They are playing like the AFC’s second-best team, which puts them on a potential course to meet the Ravens — the franchise Flacco led for more than a decade and quarterbacked to a Super Bowl in 2013. . For the Eagles to repeat as NFC champions and return to the Super Bowl, it would take a sudden and unforeseen turnaround. They have lost four of their past five games, with a shocking nadir arriving Sunday in the form of a 35-31 loss at home to the 4-12 Cardinals and Coach Jonathan Gannon, who last season served as their defensive coordinator. The Eagles’ 1-4 stretch only begins to describe the dismal state of their operation. Their last seven games have included borderline miraculous victories over the Chiefs and Bills, blowout losses to NFC contenders Dallas and San Francisco, a last-second loss to the 8-8 Seahawks, an eight-point win over the 5-11 Giants in which they were outscored in the second half and Sunday’s embarrassment against the Cardinals, when they blew a 21-6 halftime lead and yielded a 70-yard, game-winning touchdown after Arizona took over with 2:28 remaining. The Eagles yielded the NFC East lead to the Cowboys and allowed the 49ers to secure the NFC’s top seed and a first-round bye. They have not won by more than one score since beating the Dolphins, 31-17, the week before Halloween. Their plus-22 point differential is the mark of an also-ran, not a Super Bowl contender. At one point this season, Coach Nick Sirianni owned a 28-3 record over his prior 31 games. And yet questions about his performance are mounting. He’s an offensive coach, and his offense has regressed after Shane Steichen, his coordinator and play-caller last year, left to coach the Colts. His defense is a mess and hasn’t been helped by a clumsy, midseason coordinator shift from Sean Desai to Matt Patricia. The season has been full of puzzling choices like the one that led the Eagles kicking a field goal on the drive before Arizona’s game-winning touchdown. On third and 19 from the Cardinals’ 29-yard line, the Eagles ran a screen to backup running back Kenneth Gainwell with slight wideout DeVonta Smith as the lead blocker. Gainwell gained four yards and Smith suffered an injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the game and led to him leaving the stadium in a walking boot. It is decidedly not sunny in Philadelphia. . You’ll never believe this, but Mike Tomlin has overcome unsightly offensive performance and rallied the Steelers to 9-7 and an outside shot at the playoffs. The Steelers’ 30-23 victory in Seattle kept them alive in the AFC wild card race, and they need to beat a Baltimore team with no playoff implications at stake Saturday afternoon to keep them alive. The Steelers have a big problem, though. The Colts and Texans both won to keep pace and reach 9-7, too. Both of those teams beat the Steelers this season, and they play Saturday night, which assures one of them, barring a tie, will finish ahead of them in the race for the last wild card spot. How are the Steelers still alive, then? The winner of Colts-Texans could still win the AFC South if the Jaguars stumble Sunday in Tennessee. In that case, the Steelers’ record alone would give them the seventh seed. The Steelers could also still knock the Bills out of the playoffs. If they win and the Jaguars both win and the Bills lose Sunday night in Miami, the Steelers, Bills and the winner of Colts-Texans would end up in a three-way tie at 10-7 for two spots. If it unfolds that way, the Steelers would have a better conference record than Buffalo. . In the second half of the season,   on a near-weekly basis, only to stumble just as frequently. Jackson only validated his stature Sunday as the Ravens destroyed the Dolphins, 56-19, in Baltimore and clinched the AFC’s top seed. Jackson’s MVP case has rested more on the way he controls games and consistently produces spectacular plays than on gaudy statistics, but Sunday he delivered eye-popping numbers, too: 321 passing yards on 18-of-21 passing with five touchdown passes and another 35 rushing yards. The Ravens continued to peak late in the year, proving themselves to be a juggernaut whose stumbles in close games concealed their dominance earlier in the season. They gained 24 first downs on 55 plays and racked up 491 total yards. In the past two weeks, the Ravens faced two Super Bowl contenders who presented different styles and strengths, one on the road and one at home. They annihilated both, beating the 49ers and Dolphins by a combined 51 points. They are a complete team, loaded on both sides of the ball, but it all revolves around Jackson, who is an overwhelming favorite to win his second MVP in the first season after  . He’d become the 11th player to multiple MVPs, joining Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, Brett Favre, Johnny Unitas, Kurt Warner, Steve Young, Joe Montana and Patrick Mahomes. Decent company for a quarterback who turns 27 this week. . Just because analytical insight has led to greater aggression in game management doesn’t mean aggression is always an appropriate guiding principle. Both coaches proved as much during the harebrained conclusion of the Cowboys’ 20-19 victory over the Lions on Saturday night. Mike McCarthy went first. After the two-minute warning, with the Lions holding no timeouts, the Cowboys passed three times, one of them falling incomplete, rather than draining the clock with runs. McCarthy wanted to end the game with a first down, an understandable impulse, and a penalty made that infeasible through run plays. But the game dictated a conservative approach. Draining an extra 40 seconds would not only have limited the Lions’ time with the ball, but it would have dramatically altered the offensive plays at the Lions’ disposal. The Lions were able to work with the middle of the field as they carved through the Cowboys’ defense because they had enough time; those plays would’ve been impossible if the Cowboys had run three times. The presence of kicker Brandon Aubrey made McCarthy’s call even more confounding. He’s made every field goal he’s attempted this season and has been automatic even from beyond 50 yards, so extra yards were a luxury but not a necessity. When the Lions raced down the field, Dan Campbell took his turn. His first two-point call was savvy. Avoiding overtime and the whim of a coin flip, particularly on the road, is a worthy aim. Campbell would have been justified in thinking the Lions had outplayed Dallas for most of the night and would have held an edge in overtime, but he also had the Cowboys’ defense on its heel and a play call he liked. A controversial penalty negated the play, though. Once the penalty backed up the Lions to the 7, regardless of whether the flag had been justified, a two-point conversion became reckless. The Lions received a break when Micah Parsons jumped offside, but that shouldn’t let Campbell off the hook for making a suboptimal decision probably influenced by emotion. Like McCarthy, he had been aggressive for aggression’s sake rather than considering factors unique to the situation. It’s a lesson all coaches should take into the playoffs. . Pretty good Sunday in Chicago. Along with a dominant win in the snow, they secured the No. 1 pick for the second straight year. They own Carolina’s first-rounder from dealing last year’s first pick, which the Panthers used to take Bryce Young. When the Panthers lost, 26-0, to Jacksonville and the Cardinals upset the Eagles, the Panthers clinched the worst record in the NFL, a remarkable bonus for Chicago and a complete debacle for them. The Bears face a dilemma in whether to continue with Fields, who has been excellent down the stretch, and trade the first pick for another massive haul or use the first pick on a ballyhooed quarterback prospect — Caleb Williams or Drake Maye — and move on from Fields and what will quickly become a huge salary. But that is far more welcome than the questions Carolina faces, which include: Will Young overcome his lack or size to become even a serviceable quarterback after his dismal rookie season? And why, exactly, did the Panthers just toss the phenomenal DJ Moore into that trade?",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/nfl-best-worst-week-17/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 10:30:00,

JERUSALEM — Israel’s high court on Monday struck down Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s polarizing law that sought to limit the court’s power over government decisions and sparked mass anti-government protests and international condemnation. Netanyahu’s   upended Israel in the months leading to the   — and now threaten to cause a constitutional and leadership crisis just three months after the hotly divided country united behind the war effort. Netanyahu’s Likud party slammed the decision as “in opposition to the nation’s desire for unity, especially in a time of war.” “Today the Supreme Court faithfully fulfilled its role in protecting the citizens of Israel,” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said on X, formerly Twitter. Monday’s ruling concerned an amendment to Israel’s “Basic Law,” which serves in place of a constitution, that was pushed through and   by Netanyahu’s far-right government in July. The altered law removed the right of the Israeli Supreme Court to block decisions made by government ministers that the judges deem “unreasonable.” In striking down the law 8 to 7 on Monday, the top court’s ruling calls for the legislation to be removed. If Netanyahu’s government refuses to honor the ruling, the wartime country could face a constitutional crisis. The overhaul plan, which Netanyahu’s coalition first proposed last January, set off nearly a year of   and drew   from military and senior security officials. Supporters of the legislation said it was a necessary corrective to an activist Supreme Court led by a clique of elite judges. Opponents said the law could lead to authoritarianism and paved the way for Netanyahu’s far-right and ultra-Orthodox backers to alter key foundation’s of Israel’s liberal democracy. Weekly protests against the proposal drew hundreds of thousands of people. Military pilots and soldiers threatened not to report for volunteer duty if the government refused to back off its plan. In March, Netanyahu fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, after Gallant   to halt its plan, warning of potential security problems for Israel if reservists walked out. Gallant was reinstated two weeks later. President Biden, one of Israel’s staunchest allies, in March also came out against the law in a rare public disagreement. “I hope he walks away from it,” Biden said, adding the Netanyahu’s government “cannot continue down this road.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/01/israel-supreme-court-judicial-reform-netanyahu/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 14:50:00,
"You won’t hear   talking about it much, but a key record has been broken during his watch: The United States is producing more oil than any country ever has. The flow of huge amounts of crude from American producers is playing a big role in keeping prices down at the pump, diminishing the geopolitical power of OPEC and taming inflation. The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline nationwide has dropped to close to $3, and analysts project it could stay that way leading up to the presidential election, potentially assuaging the economic anxieties of swing-state voters who will be crucial to Biden’s hopes of a second term. You won’t hear   talking about it much, but a key record has been broken during his watch: The United States is producing more oil than any country ever has. The flow of huge amounts of crude from American producers is playing a big role in keeping prices down at the pump, diminishing the geopolitical power of OPEC and taming inflation. The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline nationwide has dropped to close to $3, and analysts project it could stay that way leading up to the presidential election, potentially assuaging the economic anxieties of swing-state voters who will be crucial to Biden’s hopes of a second term. But it is not something the president publicly boasts about. The politics of oil are particularly tricky for Democrats, whose chances for victory in the 2024 elections could hinge on whether young, climate-conscious voters come out in big numbers. Many of those voters want to hear that Biden is doing everything in his power to keep oil in the ground. “If you are not looking carefully at what the administration is actually doing, it is easy to get the wrong impression,” said Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm. “There are a lot of things going on at once. This is an administration which is focused on the energy transition, but also taking a pragmatic approach on fossil fuels.” The United States is producing  about 13.2 million barrels of crude oil per day. That is millions of gallons more than is coming out of Saudi Arabia or Russia. It is more oil than was being produced even at its peak during the pro-fossil-fuels administration of former president  , when production was 13 million barrels a day in November 2019. Voters who listen to Trump and Biden speak may come away with the impression that the opposite is true. Trump recently told Fox News’s Sean Hannity that he would act as a dictator only on the first day of his presidency in 2025, in part because he wanted to “drill, drill, drill” for more oil. The former president has constantly attacked Biden’s clean energy agenda and accused him of squandering America’s prior “energy independence” because of allegiance to “environmental lunatics.” While Biden’s White House has publicly celebrated the decline in   and pledged to help consumers struggling with inflation, the president has largely stayed mum about the oil industry’s record output. In several speeches this year, he has blasted oil company executives for amassing record profits. “They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down,” Biden said during his State of the Union address in February. “Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.” The White House has also largely stayed mum on the oil production boom, instead touting Biden’s legislative record as the most ambitious effort to combat climate change in history and contrasting his stance with that of Trump and other deniers. “The President is implementing the largest investment in climate ever, putting the United States on a path to cut climate pollution in half by 2030,” White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández said in a statement. The statement praised Biden for protecting more than 21 million acres of public lands and waters and boosting clean-energy manufacturing by invoking the Defense Production Act and facilitating private-sector investments. “The President will continue to take bold climate action and rally world leaders to raise their collective ambition.” The soaring domestic oil output has already begun to reshape geopolitical dynamics. The United States is producing so much oil that it has undermined the influence of OPEC, which  failed when it tried to make production cuts recently to drive prices up globally. The amount cut was quickly backfilled by the United States and other non-OPEC nations, which gladly grabbed the market share OPEC forfeited. The diminishment of OPEC’s influence gives Democratic operatives one less thing to worry about. It was only last year, during the midterm election, that Saudi Arabia embarrassed the administration by disregarding its requests not to cut production as prices at the pump were soaring. As things stand now, Saudi Arabia is not in a position to influence the U.S. election by pushing oil prices up as voting nears, which typically sours consumers on the incumbent in the White House. The huge boost in U.S. oil production has defied analyst expectations and driven energy prices down around the globe. White House policy is hardly the key factor, but it has helped. Biden’s vows on the campaign trail to restrict growth of fossil fuels gave way to a more moderate approach after Russia invaded Ukraine and prices soared. The signal he sent to the industry as voters struggled with  high gas prices was clear: Pump more. “When the head of the U.S. government tells industry to produce more, that is significant,” Book said. “It reflected a sea change, and certainly the end of a campaign of very restrictive rhetoric.” The shift, he said, gave oil companies and their investors the confidence to redouble their efforts to pull oil from the ground. They were able to ramp up production so high in large part because of efficiencies and innovations in the way oil is pumped. “These companies have gotten more effective at drilling more rapidly,” said Mark Finley, a fellow in energy and global oil at Rice University’s Baker Institute. “They are drilling longer wells, and they are getting more production from each well.” He said analysts had not anticipated such strong growth because oil company investors were pressuring companies to scale back their infrastructure spending amid projections that the energy transition will shrink the market for fossil fuels. But, Finley said, the companies have managed to recalibrate their infrastructure investments and increase output at the same time. It is a mixed blessing for Biden. At the moment, the administration appears content not to be taking too much credit. The continued attacks from Republicans accusing the president of jeopardizing America’s energy security with his focus on climate action are out of sync with the reality on the ground, but they give Biden cover with his base. At the same time, the relatively low gas prices help him with swing voters. “While the administration is pushing for an energy transition, they know prices at the pump matter to the economy, consumer pocketbooks and also their reelection prospects,” Finley said. Climate activists have slammed   in West Virginia and a separate decision to   in Alaska, which is opposed by environmentalists. Some liberals have also criticized Biden’s assertion in August that he had “practically” declared a climate emergency with his environmental policies, saying he should actually declare one, to combat extreme weather and other threats. Biden has taken steps to reduce methane emissions and also signed historic climate and infrastructure legislation aimed at weaning the country off fossil fuels in the years ahead. But the current rush of domestic oil production comes as the president’s push to facilitate a transition to electric vehicles is  , providing an uncomfortable contrast for the White House. As U.S. oil production was soaring to record levels in December, Biden administration officials were at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Dubai assuring world leaders that the United States would help lead the global transition away from fossil fuels. That dichotomy stood out to Amara Enyia, an activist and policy director for the Movement for Black Lives, who attended the conference, known as COP28. “There’s this dissonance between the commitments that are being made versus what the administration is actually doing,” she said. “We’re seeing this sort of two-headed approach to climate — on the one hand, drilling permits, and then on the other, talking about the need to move away from fossil fuels.” For his part, Biden has said his top domestic priority is reducing prices for Americans, and the relief at the pump carries potential benefits for his 2024 prospects. A short-term boost in domestic oil production and a corresponding decline in gas prices could have a long-term benefit for environmentalists — helping prevent the return to power of Trump and other deniers of climate change, said Josh Freed, the director of climate and energy at the center-left think tank Third Way. “The fastest way to end all of American climate action is to see oil prices dramatically rise and have Republicans get elected to office,” he said, commending Biden’s handling of the issue. Whether Biden is successfully walking this  tightrope is likely to remain a matter of debate ahead of November’s election. Climate activists say base voters are frustrated by the softening of the president’s stance against fossil fuels, and mobilizing them will prove difficult despite the historic investment the administration is making in green power and accelerating the energy transition. Climate-conscious voters were particularly dismayed by the administration’s approval of the Willow project, which will allow hundreds of miles of roads and pipelines, airstrips, a gravel mine and a major new processing facility in the middle of pristine Arctic tundra and wetland. For many, that decision was one of several signifying how Biden’s bold campaign promises to take on the fossil fuel companies yielded to dealmaking on permits and a more conciliatory approach toward the industry overall. “You can’t solve the climate crisis without keeping fossil fuels in the ground,” said Jamie Henn, founder of Fossil Free Media, a nonprofit focused on ending oil and gas use. “Record oil production stands in the way of the energy transition … An ‘all of the above approach’ leads to flip-flopping on fossil fuels. It is bad policy, and also bad politics.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/31/us-oil-production-has-hit-record-under-biden-he-hardly-mentions-it/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 06:00:00,

The runaway GOP polling leader   they are “poisoning the blood of our country” — comments some experts have   to Adolf Hitler’s writings on blood purity. Florida Gov.     part of his state’s African American history   that claimed some enslaved people developed skills that “could be applied for their personal benefit.” And   omitted any mention of slavery when she was asked to explain the cause of the Civil War at a town hall event this past week. It wasn’t until the next day that Haley   the war was “about slavery.” The Republican Party’s three leading presidential candidates are speaking about history and race in polarizing and provocative ways that sometimes diverge from or distort the facts, some political strategists, experts and civil rights leaders said. Their comments have stoked outrage among many Americans and risk alienating wide swaths of voters, including the independent and moderate voters whom Haley has been courting, according to strategists in both parties. But their rhetoric is also appealing to many Americans who lean conservative, interviews with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire show, including some who reject the accusations that the statements are racially insensitive or worse. Many in the GOP are resentful of liberal leaders who they see as constantly pointing out or forcing the country to apologize for past atrocities, and some are angry about demographic and cultural shifts in America driven in part by immigration. “It’s part of this time warp that the Republican Party is in,” said Stuart Stevens, a former presidential campaign strategist for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney. He pointed to how Republican leaders targeted  , the biracial former NFL quarterback who took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and social injustice, and tangled with NASCAR after it   the Confederate flag at events. “I think Republicans are still litigating a lot of these issues internally that the rest of the world long ago moved on from,” added Stevens. He added that they are catering to voters who “see the world changing and find it unsettling.” But some conservative voters in the first two nominating states this past week expressed different views. Even as Haley’s comments stoked controversy around the country, many who attended her events in Iowa and New Hampshire said they took no issue with her initial answer that left out slavery. Doug Vogel, 56, who attended a Friday event in Concord, N.H., said he thought concerns about Haley’s answer were overblown, and he thought she accurately addressed the legal concerns that were at play over states’ rights. “She spoke the truth,” he said. At a Haley town hall in Cedar Falls, Iowa, on Friday night, retiree Dorothy Fischer was more enthusiastic about Haley than ever after hearing her speak in person — and indignant at the firestorm over Haley’s explanation of the Civil War. Fischer, a Republican who is eager for the party to move on from Trump, said the war wasn’t driven by slavery. “It was an economic battle” that pitted “Southern plantation economics versus the Northern industrial economics,” she said. Her sister, Barbara Hatinger, who is also retired and Republican, agreed with the GOP candidates’ broader complaints about U.S. discourse on race: “The Democrats always want to play the victim card,” she said. The 2024 Republican field at one point included a , including Haley, who broke barriers as the country’s first female Asian American governor. Many in the GOP celebrated this diversity. But some Democrats have argued that the way the candidates have talked about racial issues has been problematic. “When you think about Donald Trump, a man who is now parroting Hitler, talking about poisoning the blood of this country, when you think about Ron DeSantis who talked about slavery actually benefiting the slaves, this is just typical,” said Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison. Trump has   the comparisons to Hitler, and DeSantis has said the Florida curriculum — which also covers the horrors of slavery — is not meant to cast the institution in a positive light. But some experts have not been satisfied by their responses. “The stock in trade of the GOP is evasion — Haley’s silence on slavery. And falsification — the Florida curriculum’s pretense that slavery had positive aspects,” said Amy Dru Stanley, a University of Chicago history professor. She added: “This false history plays into conspiracy theory. It damages efforts of racial reckoning and reconciliation.” The pattern of Republican leaders inflaming the debate over racial issues has played out in countless ways after America’s conversation about race was thrust to the forefront by the election of Barack Obama as the nation’s first Black president. Trump — who built his political following in part by falsely suggesting that Obama was hiding his   — has largely shaped the party’s tactics. Trump was elected in 2016 after harnessing the politics of   and promising that the “silent majority” was back and was “going to take our country back.” In 2020, Trump showed that he was closely attuned to the backlash among some White voters to the cultural reckoning that took place following the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a White Minneapolis police officer, who was later   of murder. Amid that year’s debate about how to teach systemic racism in America in schools, Trump filled his 2020 campaign speeches with attacks on the movement to remove or replace monuments honoring Confederate generals. He   an “unhinged left-wing mob” of trying to “vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments” and “demolish our heritage.” In 2021, Republican lawmakers in state legislatures across the country led campaigns against the teaching of critical race theory, an academic framework that holds that racism is systemic in America. “Nixon said this stuff in private — we know from his tapes — and [George] Wallace said this stuff, and [Pat] Buchanan said this stuff. But I don’t think any presumptive presidential nominee has been so overt for a long time, at least some decades,” said Jennifer Hochschild, the H.L. Jayne professor of government, and professor of African and African American studies at Harvard University. Trump is now reigniting themes he used to launch his 2016 campaign when he argued that undocumented immigrants were “rapists” who were bringing drugs and crime across the border into the United States. Despite condemnation from historians and scholars who say Trump’s latest rhetoric is a clear echo of the “contamination of the blood” concept in Hitler’s antisemitic manifesto “Mein Kampf,” Trump has   on his assertions that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of this country as he promises to enlist the military in the “largest domestic deportation effort in American history.” Trump has denied that his statements are racist and continues to insist that he has never read “Mein Kampf.” “What I’m saying when I talk about people coming into our country is they are destroying our country,” he told conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt when pressed on the topic in a recent interview. Trump on Saturday took to social media to accuse Democrats, without evidence, of allowing “totally unvetted migrants” into the United States “SO THEY CAN VOTE,” and “signing them up at a rapid pace.” The baseless claim echoed   falsely suggesting Democrats are seeking to illegally register noncitizens to vote. GOP presidential candidate  , who has excited some voters in the base but remains a long shot,   that “great replacement theory” — which holds that Jews, minorities and immigrants are attempting to replace White, native-born Americans through immigration and higher fertility rates — “is not some grand right-wing conspiracy theory, but a basic statement of the Democratic Party’s platform.” The candidates’ rhetoric could come at a political price 10 years after the Republican Party flirted with adopting a more inclusive message to bring more racial minorities into the party after the 2012 election. Some recent polling suggests Trump has made inroads with Black voters in key swing states because of dissatisfaction with President Biden’s policies — and Trump did make some gains with Hispanic voters in 2020, according to a  . But the GOP’s focus on polarizing racial themes could alienate those same voters as the November election draws closer, strategists from both parties said. Haley attracted widespread attention with her comments at a Wednesday night town hall in Berlin, N.H. She made no mention of slavery in her response to a questioner who wanted her to say what caused the Civil War. “What do you want me to say about slavery?” she asked when the attendee pressed the issue. The next day, after widespread criticism, Haley acknowledged that the war was indeed “about slavery” and said she didn’t mention it earlier because she thought it was a “given.” Michael Steele, who is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and is Black, said Haley missed a key opportunity at a moment when he believes Republican leaders should more forcefully address the racial tensions in this country and work with their political opponents to try to diminish them. “She didn’t want to piss off White folks in Iowa,” Steele said bluntly, adding that her answer “did a great disservice as a presidential candidate.” Several voters at Haley’s first town hall in Iowa this week, in Dubuque, brushed off the furor over her Civil War answer — sometimes taking greater offense to the question. Others said they hadn’t heard of the controversy. “It’s unfortunate that she didn’t say slavery,” said Joe Stapf, a Republican retiree from Dubuque. “It was a fundamental mistake … but everybody makes mistakes,” echoed his wife, Eileen. Asked about broader backlash to some discussions of race, the Stapfs said racism is a problem and shouldn’t be ignored. Dubuque has been plagued by some   over the years, including cross burnings and a Ku Klux Klan rally in the 1990s, as well as   involving racist language and imagery. The Stapfs said they found Haley to be frank and direct in general and dismissed the Civil War query as, in Joe’s words, “a gotcha question.” An independent voter who dislikes both DeSantis and Trump — but would back Haley over Biden in the general election — said she’s largely ignored the criticism of Haley’s Civil War comments, cynical about how they might be misconstrued. “I’m sure somebody had to take a piece of whatever she said and blow it up,” said the woman, Barbara, who spoke on the condition that her full name not be used. Shown the full context of Haley’s answer, she indicated it didn’t bother her. In New Hampshire, as Haley spoke at a brewery near ski resorts filled with vacationers from nearby Massachusetts, some in the audience said they disagreed with her original answer to the Civil War question. “I think she slipped up,” said Shala Siddiqui, who added that slavery is an important concern for American society even today and shouldn’t be brushed aside or unmentioned. Over her career, Haley has spoken in high-profile ways about race, particularly when she made the decision to   the Confederate flag from the State House grounds in South Carolina after the racist massacre at a Black church in Charleston in 2015. Her admirers describe it as a moment of political courage, and she was widely praised for focusing at that time on racial healing in her state. After the fatal shooting of  , a Black man who was shot in the back by a police officer after a traffic stop in 2015, Haley signed a bill requiring law enforcement to wear body cameras. Haley raised the Confederate flag episode unprompted in Iowa on Friday, describing her role as understanding the perspectives of both sides and seeking consensus. “I knew 50 percent of South Carolinians saw the Confederate flag as heritage and tradition. The other 50 percent saw it as slavery and hate. My job wasn’t to judge either side. My job is to get them to see the best of themselves and go forward,” Haley said. “Leaders aren’t supposed to decide who’s right or wrong or good or bad. … What a leader does is know where people are, and communicate their way forward so that you can get to a better place.” But her efforts to heal racial divides have not been a major focal point of her 2024 campaign. She launched her candidacy with a speech declaring that “America is not a racist country,” a blanket statement that critics who see systemic injustices have criticized. Her answer to the Civil War question on Wednesday night in Berlin, N.H., drew attention to one of the central criticisms of her candidacy, which is her caution and her tendency to stay on script. “She’s a fear-driven candidate,” Republican strategist Mike Murphy said. “She’s so afraid of offending anybody in the base that she goes to the word-salad thing.” The controversy also put new attention on Haley’s 2010 answer to a similar question. During a private conversation with two leaders of Confederate heritage groups, which later became public after it was posted online, she described the Civil War as a   between “tradition” and “change.” Former New Jersey governor  , who is competing with Haley for moderate and independent voters in New Hampshire, seized on her 2010 comment, warning voters not to back someone who avoids speaking hard truths because they are “afraid of offending people who support Donald Trump. “The Civil War was not a choice between change and tradition. It was a choice between right and wrong and that’s it. And we’ve got to stand on the side of right,” he said at his own town hall in Epping, N.H., on Thursday. DeSantis, who is polling a distant second behind Trump in Iowa, has pushed back on some efforts to make amends for the ugliest chapters in the country’s racial history, which Republicans call misguided. He signed a Florida   in April of 2022 that barred teaching that an individual, by virtue of their race, “bears responsibility for … actions committed in the past by other members of the same race.” At the time, he   Florida would not “use your tax dollars to teach our kids to hate this country or to hate each other.” The Florida governor this year defended new African American history standards in his state that said students should learn “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit,” while discussing how they did work ranging from farming to blacksmithing. Many Black leaders and historians called the suggestion of a benefit to slavery offensive. DeSantis on Thursday said his critics — including Vice President Harris — had “bastardized” that section “to try to create a narrative.” DeSantis has also faced criticism for mispronouncing Harris’s first name, a tactic many other Republicans have also adopted. Pressed by a reporter on why he consistently mispronounces Harris’s first name, DeSantis said on Thursday he didn’t think his pronunciation was very different. Faulting Haley for bungling her answer about the Civil War, DeSantis said she had “some problems with some basic American history” and wasn’t “ready for prime time.” Even before DeSantis began  , Black leaders protested what they viewed as his racially divisive tactics. The redistricting plan that he championed, which eliminated two districts that were drawn to ensure representation of Black voters, drew opposition even from members of DeSantis’s own party in the state legislature. Black leaders balked not only at DeSantis’s efforts to restrict certain teachings about race, but also his push to halt funding for “diversity, equity and inclusion” training at state colleges. When he attended the   in Jacksonville for victims killed in August by a White gunman who said he hated Black people, according to authorities, one man shouted at the governor: “You’re not welcome here!” DeSantis, in his remarks, said it was “totally unacceptable” that the gunman had targeted people based on their race. He was praised by allies and some Democrats for appearing at an event attended by many who were likely to be critical of his policies.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2023/12/30/trump-desantis-haley-race-slavery/,Washington Post,2023-12-30 18:15:00,
"In President Biden’s increasingly stark telling, an America led by former president   in 2025 would be a dystopian dictatorship with American values constantly on the brink of collapse. “The greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy,” Biden said earlier this month at a fundraiser in Bethesda. “Because if we lose, we lose everything.” In President Biden’s increasingly stark telling, an America led by former president   in 2025 would be a dystopian dictatorship with American values constantly on the brink of collapse. “The greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy,” Biden said earlier this month at a fundraiser in Bethesda. “Because if we lose, we lose everything.” Trump, who has used terms like “vermin” to describe his enemies and called 2024 “the final battle,” has said if Biden wins a second term, Americans would “no longer have a country” and the globe would quickly descend into a third world war. “As long as Joe Biden is in the White House, the American Dream is dead,” Trump said during a rally in Durham, N.H., where he also accused migrants of “poisoning the blood” of the nation. As the two leading candidates trade depictions of doom, the 2024 race for president is increasingly dominated by dark sentiments and appeals to fear — a phenomenon experts and pollsters say is reflective of the country’s broadly pessimistic and apprehensive mood. As Democrats often point out, while Biden’s warnings repeat Trump’s explicit promises about what he would do if he wins, Trump’s predictions often reflect baseless hyperbole. But the result is that if either man wins next November, nearly half of the country could be primed to believe it spells the end of the nation and its values. White House officials and Biden campaign aides have said they feel compelled to respond to the former president’s growing use of hateful, bleak messaging. As recent polls have shown Trump with a commanding lead in the Republican primary and a consistent, if smaller, lead in a general election matchup with Biden, the president and his aides have increasingly invoked ominous language as they seek to raise an alarm about the potential return of his predecessor. “What’s at stake in 2024: Donald Trump and his MAGA Republicans are determined to destroy American democracy,” Biden told donors in Weston, Mass., this month. “And that, again, is not hyperbole. That’s a fact. The former president makes no bones about it. Don’t take my word for it. Just listen to what he has to say.” He went on to read a list of some of Trump’s most incendiary quotes. For Biden’s allies, repeating and responding to Trump’s rhetoric — and at times using stark language of their own — represent a key component of the messaging strategy for next year’s election. While some Democrats worry about elevating their opponent’s rhetoric, at the core of much of the president’s reelection pitch is a warning that if Trump returns to power, Americans’ democratic values, fundamental freedoms and physical safety would be under threat. “Trump’s America in 2025: More Guns, More Shootings, More Deaths,” read one Biden campaign statement last month, part of a series of messages aimed at describing what life under Trump would be like if he takes office 13 months from now. Other messages have portrayed a second-term Trump as “coming after your health care,” rounding up immigrants into detention centers and attempting to be a “Day One Dictator.” The latter moniker was derived from Trump’s claim, in an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity, that he would only be a dictator on the first day of his presidency. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. But the former president has only escalated his apocalyptic descriptions of America and its ostensible future under another Biden term. “Our border has been erased. Criminals are running wild in our Democrat-run cities. And thanks to crooked Joe’s breathtaking weakness, the world is going up in flames,” Trump said at a  . “The whole world is up in flames.” He also told his audience that “the communists, Marxists and fascists are going hard after Catholics” and that Democrats “want people to take your children and do things with your children that are not even speakable.” Biden and “the far-left lunatics,” he said, are “willing to violate the U.S. Constitution at levels never seen before,” adding that “we’re very close” to World War III. While candidates have always embraced negative messages to some degree, the increasingly harsh tone of this race stands in contrast to the rhetoric of candidates such as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama, who built their campaigns largely around soaring language and uplifting visions for the future, said Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center of Public Affairs. If Trump secures the Republican nomination, warnings about his return could make it difficult for voters to hear an affirmative reason to vote for Biden rather than simply an appeal to defeat his opponent, Perry said. “Biden has positive things to say, but the things that Trump is saying are so destructive that he can’t ignore them,” she said, adding that it “cuts against type” for the typically optimistic Biden to spend so much time focused on dystopian themes.  about the importance of not letting violent or extreme rhetoric go unchallenged, and aides say that has influenced his decision to call out Trump on a more regular basis. Jon Meacham, a historian who has advised Biden and occasionally helped him craft speeches, said the president “has a moral obligation” to confront Trump’s language, which “comes directly from the darkest years of the bloodiest centuries.” Scholars have particularly spotlighted Trump’s comments to rallygoers that “I am your retribution,” his railing against “demonic forces” and his use of language reminiscent of Adolf Hitler, who fixated on blood purity and also described people as “vermin.” “To speculate, as some are, that Biden’s campaign might be ‘negative’ or full of ‘foreboding’ when he’s warning against Nazi rhetoric is like blaming a firefighter who shows up to save a burning building for the fire itself,” Meacham wrote in an email. The darkening tone comes as Biden’s efforts at more positive messaging have struggled to gain traction. After spending months pitching “Bidenomics” and touting his record and accomplishments, Biden still faces stubbornly low poll numbers and poor public views of the economy, a phenomenon he has  about. Biden’s approval rating has tied his record low, standing at 38 percent with 58 percent disapproving, according to a Washington Post average of 12 polls in December. Majorities of Americans have told pollsters that they feel the country is on the wrong track, that their outlook for the economy is negative and that they don’t want a rematch of Biden and Trump in 2024. Given that, it is arguably not surprising that each candidate is focused on amplifying the negative views about his rival. The White House, often reluctant to comment on 2024 candidates due to laws restricting politicking by public servants, has released several statements in recent weeks responding to Trump’s comments. “Echoing the grotesque rhetoric of fascists and violent white supremacists and threatening to oppress those who disagree with the government are dangerous attacks on the dignity and rights of all Americans, on our democracy, and on public safety,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement after Trump claimed migrants were “poisoning the blood of our country.” While Biden’s allies have focused most of their attention on Trump, other Republican presidential contenders are   in their campaigns. Former U.N. ambassador   has staked much of her election bid on portraying a “ ,” arguing that “ ” to handle the gathering storm clouds of international unrest. Florida Gov.   has used antagonistic language to blast his perceived enemies, pledging to destroy the “woke mob” and to have U.S. troops shoot suspected drug traffickers “stone cold dead” at the border. Such rhetoric has come to dominate GOP politics in part because it has proved effective in recent years, said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked for congressional leaders during the rise of the tea party movement. “It tells us something about the trajectory of this campaign: that there’s nothing about it that’s going to be uplifting,” Heye said, adding that he understands why the president is also shifting to more negative messaging. “Biden knows if the election was held today, he’d lose. So he’s trying to turn this away from being a referendum on him to a choice, and that makes sense.” Still, Biden’s campaign has sought to balance its warnings about Trump with a positive pitch about the president’s accomplishments. His campaign launch video began with chilling footage from the deadly  , 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, but it then shifted to brighter imagery showcasing Biden’s accomplishments and smiling Americans. Most of the campaign’s television ads since the April launch have been positive spots focused on the president’s record. Biden, who also cast his 2020 bid as a contest between darkness and light, often ends speeches by saying he has never been more optimistic about the country’s future. His aides point to his 2022 messaging, which included warnings about GOP extremism and threats to democracy, as a model for success, given Democrats’ unexpectedly strong performance in that year’s elections. Still, Trump’s embrace of doom-filled language — and his strong position in the polls — has caused the Biden team to intensify its effort to raise the alarm about the risks posed by the former president. Michael Tyler, the communications director for the Biden campaign, released a memo recently pointing out several of Trump’s most incendiary comments and asserting that America remains “in a battle for the soul of our nation.” While amplifying the potential dangers of a second Trump term could motivate some liberals to vote out of fear, many Democrats have warned that voters could be turned off by the broad negativity of a Trump-Biden race. Several strategists and activists have expressed concern that key constituencies will stay home if they do not hear more affirmative reasons to support Biden’s reelection. At the recent Democratic fundraiser in Bethesda punctuated by dire warnings about Trump, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) stood out by making a point that has become increasingly rare in Democratic politics. “This election is not about the danger of electing Donald Trump,” he said. “It’s about the promise of reelecting Joe Biden.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/31/biden-trump-doomsday-rhetoric/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 07:00:00,
"TEL AVIV — Israel said it will be withdrawing some troops from Gaza this week, an indication it may be changing its tactics on the ground even as it remains committed to the war effort. In a statement Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that two brigades would be pulled back from Gaza this week. Three others would follow at an undisclosed date, the IDF said. TEL AVIV — Israel said it will be withdrawing some troops from Gaza this week, an indication it may be changing its tactics on the ground even as it remains committed to the war effort. In a statement Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that two brigades would be pulled back from Gaza this week. Three others would follow at an undisclosed date, the IDF said. The details about the planned withdrawal come after Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesperson,   Sunday night that pulling back reservists “will significantly ease the burden on the economy and allow them to gather strength for the upcoming activities in the next year.” Israel’s withdrawal of the five brigades could include several thousand soldiers, but Hagari vowed that “prolonged fighting” would continue into 2024. Analysts said the move indicated the military may be shifting to a more targeted approach amid pressure from the United States and other countries to mitigate the civilian toll of its operations in Gaza. “This appears to be the start of the gradual shift to lower intensity operations in the north that we have been encouraging, which reflects the success the IDF has had in dismantling  ’s military capabilities there,” said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Israel’s military operations. The IDF declined to provide figures for how many troops would be withdrawn. Since Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials, 21,978 people have been killed and 57,697 injured in Gaza, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. The war has   nearly 2 million people, who are suffering shortages of water, food and medical care. Reducing the number of troops in Gaza appeared to signal a new stage of the war, one “of long-term, lower intensity combat, as the Biden administration has pushed for,” said Charles D. Freilich, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and a former Israeli deputy national security adviser. The United States has backed Israel’s fight against Hamas with weapons and diplomacy, while urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to lessen the humanitarian toll of the offensive. Casualties in Gaza have continued to mount, and aid organizations   of an impending famine. Hagari did not mention U.S. pressure in his statement, citing instead the economic burden the war has had on the country. The vast mobilization of   300,000 reservists for Israel’s war effort has dealt a blow to its workforce, especially in the high-tech sector. Economists   estimate that the war has cost the government about $18 billion — or $220 million a day. Hagari said that combat had not stalled and would continue into 2024. But “most of what can be achieved through the high-intensity combat has been achieved,” Freilich said. “Hamas has been badly mauled but has not been destroyed or toppled as the governing body. And that effort will continue through a different approach, a longer-term one,” he said. It could include continued fighting in the city of Khan Younis and a potential push further south to target tunnels between Gaza and Egypt, he said. In Israel’s north,   on the border with Lebanon continued to flare Monday. The IDF said rockets were fired into northern Israel, injuring five soldiers and that it struck military targets in Lebanon. Hezbollah said three of its fighters were killed Monday,  , citing the group’s Telegram account. As Gaza rang in a new year, civilians said they felt no letup in the fighting. “No one is talking about the new year here in Gaza. It’s a luxury thing no one here can afford now,” said one humanitarian worker in Rafah who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized by his organization to speak. Israeli strikes echoed across Deir al-Balah, Maghazi and Khan Younis in the first hours of the new year. Across the enclave, Gazans braced for the morning routine, when they examine the night’s full damage. On Monday, 36-year-old Rafif Aziz craved the homemade sweets she typically ate on New Year’s Day with her husband and children as they discussed their hopes for the coming year. “For hours yesterday, they have not stopped asking me about the sweets they are accustomed to,” she said of her children, while speaking to The Post by phone from Deir al-Balah, a city in central Gaza where 80 of her relatives were sheltering in two small homes. “I had no answer to give them.” In 2023, Aziz survived displacement, hunger, disease, bombs and being trapped under rubble. “All I hope now is that my children will forget all this pain that has befallen their little hearts, that their coming days will be better,” she said, “and that we will psychologically overcome everything we have been through.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/01/israel-gaza-troops-withdrawal/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 15:41:00,
"Donald Trump’s leading Republican primary challengers said in recent days that if they are elected, they would pardon the former president should he be convicted of any of the   he’s currently facing. Florida Gov.   and former governor of South Carolina   argued in separate campaign stops last week that extending clemency to Trump would be in the country’s best interest. Both had previously signaled they were leaning toward issuing a pardon, but their recent statements were the most definitive yet and left little room for doubt just weeks before the first nominating contests in January. Donald Trump’s leading Republican primary challengers said in recent days that if they are elected, they would pardon the former president should he be convicted of any of the   he’s currently facing. Florida Gov.   and former governor of South Carolina   argued in separate campaign stops last week that extending clemency to Trump would be in the country’s best interest. Both had previously signaled they were leaning toward issuing a pardon, but their recent statements were the most definitive yet and left little room for doubt just weeks before the first nominating contests in January. “I would pardon Trump if he is found guilty,” Haley told a crowd in Plymouth, N.H., on Thursday. DeSantis, who has   Trump’s dominance in the polls in part on the string of criminal indictments, said Friday that he would pardon a convicted Trump because “we got to move on as a country.” Speaking with reporters after a campaign stop in Elkader, Iowa, DeSantis echoed Haley’s commitment, invoking the only previous time a U.S. president has received a pardon. “It’s like Ford did to Nixon,” DeSantis said, referencing Gerald Ford’s   of disgraced former president Richard M. Nixon. “Because you just, you know, the divisions are just not in the country’s interest.” DeSantis and Haley, who are leading a winnowed field of GOP candidates opposing Trump, have for months walked a political tightrope, seeking to distinguish themselves from the former president while continuing to court his substantial bloc of supporters, whose votes will be key in deciding the Republican primary. Aside from Trump, who has remained the clear leader in polling and campaign fundraising, three of the GOP’s top four candidates have now said unequivocally that they would pardon him, with entrepreneur     to the move in July. Ex-New Jersey governor  , meanwhile, has railed against these pledges, calling Trump’s actions a threat to democracy. A pardon for Trump, Christie said on Friday, would signal “two systems of justice: One for all of us and one for the most powerful.” “If we allow that to happen as a country, we would be no better — no better — than a lot of these tinpot democracies around the world who treat the privileged different than they treat everyday citizens,” Christie said at an event in Seabrook, N.H. Trump is facing 44 federal charges and 47 state charges across  . The federal charges with the most severe penalties are those concerning allegations of obstruction of justice, which in typical cases can result in up to 20 years of imprisonment. Defendants, however, rarely receive maximum sentences and it is not clear whether Trump would be   if convicted. Trump’s conduct, especially his role in the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, is not only at the heart of criminal cases against him, it is central to officials’ decisions to keep him off presidential primary ballots in two states. In Maine, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows (D)   Trump from the ballot late last week and has been subjected to violent threats in the days since. Over the weekend, her home was “ ” — having a fake emergency call that drew heavily armed police to her house — Bellows shared in a social media  . Despite the charges against him, Trump has retained a wide lead in polls ahead of the 2024 primary, which officially begins in less than a month with a caucus in Iowa and voting in New Hampshire. According to  , Trump held a nearly 50-point lead over his two closest rivals, DeSantis and Haley, as of Sunday. In New Hampshire, Trump’s lead was smaller but still commanding, with 46 percent of potential voters supporting him, 28 points more than the next closest candidate, according to a  . DeSantis had previously   it would not be “good for the country to have an almost 80-year-old former president go to prison.” Haley made the same case in New Hampshire last week, responding to  about the former president. “A leader needs to think about what’s in the best interest of the country,” Haley said. “What’s in the best interest of the country is not to have an 80-year-old man sitting in jail that continues to divide our country. What’s in the best interest of our country would be to pardon him so that we can move on as a country and no longer talk about him.” New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R), who is supporting Haley in the primary, defended her remarks in a Sunday interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Look, I understand Nikki’s argument,” Sununu said. “Everybody wants to move on from the drama and the chaos of Donald Trump. We are all so tired of it. We’re all so worn out of it as Americans.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/31/desantis-haley-pledge-pardon-trump-if-hes-convicted/,Washington Post,2023-12-31 16:53:00,
"KHARKIV, Ukraine — At a medic base an hour’s drive from the Russian border, Iryna Peshykova waited for the new year to arrive — and with it, more explosions, more carnage. The ambulance out back was already running, ready to go as the clock ticked closer to midnight, bringing her country into a third year of war with no end in sight. It was New Year’s Eve and Peshykova, 40, knew that — when the shelling began again — she’d be among the first to bear witness to the fallout. KHARKIV, Ukraine — At a medic base an hour’s drive from the Russian border, Iryna Peshykova waited for the new year to arrive — and with it, more explosions, more carnage. The ambulance out back was already running, ready to go as the clock ticked closer to midnight, bringing her country into a third year of war with no end in sight. It was New Year’s Eve and Peshykova, 40, knew that — when the shelling began again — she’d be among the first to bear witness to the fallout. That week, she’d seen Russia   — firing more than 150 missiles and drones on Friday in one of the largest attacks since invading in February 2022. At least 30 people were killed, and more than 160 were injured. Then, on Saturday, Ukraine shelled the border city of Belgorod in what Russia called a “terrorist attack.” At least 24 people were killed, said Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region. Russia retaliated by shelling Peshykova’s city of Kharkiv — home to more than 1.4 million in eastern Ukraine — injuring two dozen people and hitting apartment buildings, a hotel and a kindergarten. Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv was almost lost early in the war as Russian troops overtook nearby villages, wrapping around the city from three sides — but it had ultimately resisted defeat, though its proximity to Russia kept it in the path of danger. The tit for tat shelling foreshadowed a long winter to come as the   and soldiers dug into front lines that barely budged. Like in the trenches, morale at the medic base was low. The group was the first to confront the human damage done by missiles in Kharkiv, hoping victims would survive the race to the hospital. “There’s no New Year’s in my soul,” said Peshykova, who has worked as a medic for 15 years. “It’s just a word.” In the station kitchen, she and a half-dozen medics and ambulance drivers crowded around a table spread with plates of cookies and sliced oranges. They nursed mugs of black tea and instant coffee, waiting — unsure what their 12-hour shift would bring, unsure what new brutalities they would confront. “We are hoping it will be nothing,” said medic Nataliya Mykytenko, 48, sipping her tea. “Thoughts materialize, so we only want to think about the good,” Peshykova replied. “Hopefully we don’t have any calls.” The radio was silent — for now. Beyond the medic base, war marked the city of Kharkiv. At the Kharkiv Palace Hotel — one of the sites hit the day before — pale curtains fluttered out broken windows like flags. Above the hotel’s entrance, twinkle lights drooped. The siding was stripped to the cinder block; a floor lamp silhouetted one empty room. Mykola Yurechko, 54, stood out front and looked up at the hotel, once popular with journalists and volunteers for nongovernmental organizations. “It’s horrible,” he said. “It’s horrible.” Yurechko, who has lived in Milan for 14 years, was in his home country for the holidays visiting friends. He knew Italians who didn’t believe that the war in Ukraine was still going. One friend — married to a woman from Moscow — asked him for proof. “I said, ‘Would you agree to give your kids to go on a tour here if there was no war?’” he said. “The only thing is — when will everything be over?” In the distance, air raid sirens wailed. Underground, in the nearest subway station, the alarm faded. Trains slid by on the tracks, and an attendant droned on an overhead speaker. Families posed in front of a tall Christmas tree. Once, it had stood proudly in Kharkiv’s Freedom Square — but with the arrival of war, it had been tucked deep in the station’s belly, where it was protected. Beside the tree, a clock was topped with a Santa hat — its hands never moving forward, frozen in time. Up the subway’s escalators and across the street, in a small shop selling Ukraine’s popular “drunken cherry” — a sweet liqueur known as pyana vyshnia — a sticker of Putin was affixed to the wall near the cash register, a bullet hole between his eyes. It was 11 p.m. — the start of the nightly citywide curfew. At the table, Peshykova spoke of the calls coming in lately — so many elderly people needing help. Their children had fled and were living in countries across Europe. There was no one to look after them. One call brought her to a man, paralyzed and emaciated, who couldn’t feed himself. Another call led to a couple reliant on social services, their soiled underclothes changed only once a day. The medics’ jobs were changed by the war. During the counteroffensive, they’d followed the front lines, carting wounded soldiers to nearby hospitals, some with missing limbs. With increased shelling, patients became harder to stabilize, their bodies punctured in multiple places by shrapnel. Once, at another medic base, Peshykova had been 300 yards away when a massive aerial bomb exploded, blasting the building’s windows and shaking her to her bones. “In the beginning, we used to go to shellings every day,” she said. “Everybody wants all this to be over.” A stethoscope draped around her neck, Peshykova had sparkly nails and fluffy bangs. She showed photos of her 12-year-old son — she was raising him alone after divorcing the boy’s father, who was currently serving in the army — to her colleagues. She was handling a lot. But she would not give up. Dressed in their red uniforms — striped with reflective tape — they waited. It was now 11:30 p.m. When a call comes in, the crew has two minutes to get out the door, another 10 minutes to arrive at the victim’s location. Timing often depends on the roads — in bad shape because of the repeated shelling. They always have to be ready. “You cannot predict what the enemy would do,” Peshykova said. Russia was “trying to destroy everything.” Out back, 10 ambulances lined the parking lot. The ambulance left running was new — a donation from Poland. Flak jackets were tucked in the front, near the driver’s seat. A helmet was strapped to the back door. Their boss reminded them often that their safety was the most important thing. They weren’t on the front lines, but they were still operating in a war zone. Nearby was the husk of another ambulance, destroyed in a bombing, its frame blackened. They had towed it back to the station to remember. Another 10 minutes. They talked. They waited. The station dog — abandoned at a bus stop, now recovering from cancer — curled like a roll on the couch, where the medics sometimes slept or watched movies. Their Christmas tree was dark, ringed by empty packages, wrapped in pretty paper. They were trying to save electricity. The night dragged on. It was now five minutes to midnight. In the station kitchen, they sliced more oranges. They longed to be sipping champagne with their families. Instead, they shared olives, sliced bread, wedges of cheese and jam-filled cookies. One minute to go. Their breath, collectively held. Peshykova hoped that everything would be better next year. She dreamed the conflict would end. The clocked turned. No noise, only quiet. The new year was here, and the war continued. But for one night, they were spared.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/01/ukraine-kharkiv-ambulance-missiles/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 15:47:00,
"TOKYO — A powerful earthquake shook Japan’s western coast on Monday, collapsing buildings, burying some residents and sparking evacuation warnings amid fears of a tsunami.

TOKYO — A powerful earthquake shook Japan’s western coast on Monday, collapsing buildings, burying some residents and sparking evacuation warnings amid fears of a tsunami. The 7.6-magnitude   erupted off the Noto Peninsula about 4:10 p.m. local time and created tsunami waves with a height of about 1.2 meters, or 4 feet, within the first few minutes, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. By Monday night, Japan had dropped its highest-level tsunami alert but still had advisories in effect for the western coast, and told coastal residents not to return home as deadly waves could still come, the  . The Japan Meteorological Agency said that in the initial hours after the 7.6 quake, it measured dozens of smaller earthquakes nearby, including nine with magnitudes of over 5. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated the initial quake to have a magnitude of 7.5, and detected 11 more with a magnitude of 5 or higher over the next 12 hours. The Japanese agency warned that more earthquakes with seismic intensities of around 7 could hit seriously affected areas over the coming week, especially the next two to three days. Almost all of Japan’s western coast, including several populous cities, was placed under tsunami warnings or advisories initially, with the more urgent warnings declared in areas near the earthquake’s epicenter in central Japan. People were advised by the Japan Meteorological Agency to “evacuate immediately from coastal regions and riverside areas” to higher ground or designated evacuation buildings. There were more than 30 reports of buildings collapsing in the city of Wajima in Ishikawa Prefecture, where the earthquake’s epicenter was recorded, as well as a fire in the city center, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. At least six people were buried alive in the rubble, said Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi during a Monday news conference. Some 33,000 households in Ishikawa and Niigata prefectures lost power and mobile phone communications services there were disrupted, Hayashi said. A fire also broke out at the Shika Nuclear Power Plant in Ishikawa, but it was extinguished and had no impact on the plant’s operations, he said. The major tsunami warning for the Noto Peninsula was the first time that the most severe category of warning had been issued in Japan since 2011, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami killed tens of thousands of people, according to NHK. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s office   it had instructed authorities to prioritize human life and “spare no effort” in emergency disaster response. Across the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, authorities in South Korea said a tsunami measuring under 1 meter (3.3 feet) reached the east coast, Reuters  . Tsunami warnings were also issued in North Korea and parts of  Pacific seaboard. The tsunami warnings stoked fears across Japan, where at least   were killed after a catastrophic March 2011 earthquake off the northeastern coast of Honshu sent towering waves as high as 130 feet crashing into coastal towns, sweeping away cars and homes, and destroying multistory buildings. The 9.0-magnitude earthquake was one of the five largest  recorded in the world since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
