Meanwhile, white-collar crime gets far less notice — but it is far more expensive. Now, Congress is bringing more attention to white-collar and corporate crooks through   that would require the Department of Justice to gather, analyze and publish data on federal corporate crime. The sponsors aim for greater oversight, enforcement and deterrence. “While the Department of Justice regularly collects data on nearly every type of street-level crime, there is very little reporting of corporate and white-collar crimes, with the last thorough DOJ report on corporate crime being in 1979,” said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-Pa.), as she introduced the House bill. “Without data or transparency, lawmakers, journalists and the public are left in the dark about the size and scope of corporate crime in America and the effectiveness of the federal government’s response.” The size and scope of corporate crime are massive, with an annual price tag exceeding $300 billion, according to FBI data cited by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). The street crime tab, by comparison, is a meager $16 billion. Yet, while corporate crime costs much more, it is prosecuted far less, Durbin told a pre-Christmas  , colorfully titled “Cleaning Up the C-Suite: Ensuring Accountability for Corporate Criminals.” As corporate-crime costs soar, Justice lacks resources “to battle deep-pocketed corporations,” Durbin lamented. The department regularly forgoes corporate, criminal prosecutions, he said, opting instead for better-behavior agreements with company bosses. Too few resources, he added, “is a bipartisan failing.” In response, a Justice spokesperson said the department “is focused on the impact of our prosecutions, not just the number of them. We pour resources into bringing the most serious cases against the most significant wrongdoers.” The opioid outrage involving Purdue Pharma and its Sackler family owners was mentioned repeatedly at the hearing as an example of big-business individuals not being prosecuted. Currently, the   is examining the legality of a financial plan the company accepted after declaring bankruptcy in 2019. Purdue faced lawsuits that accused the firm of fueling widespread opioid addiction by pushing the OxyContin painkiller. “Why was no criminal action brought against the Sacklers?” Durbin asked at the hearing. Nicole Argentieri, DOJ’s acting assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division, responded, saying, “We follow the facts and the law and we apply the principles of federal prosecution.” But for Durbin, “the message is basically if you’ve got enough money, you can game the system and walk away with plenty of billions when it’s left over.” Purdue Pharma declined to comment. Ryan Hampton, a 43-year-old recovering opioid addict in Las Vegas, complained to senators that “the notion that certain executives at select companies are simply too big to jail has caused tremendous harm to American citizens and has eroded the public’s trust in our institutions.” While “pharmaceutical companies have pled guilty to major federal crimes and settled multibillion-dollar lawsuits,” he added, “justice has still not materialized for victims.” Hampton told me he’ll celebrate nine years clean on Feb. 2, after being hooked for a decade. Justice officials rebuff the notion that corporate criminals escape punishment. “The Department is committed to holding accountable those who engage in the most significant wrongdoing,” its statement said, “and to accomplish this, the Department targets its resources on the most impactful cases supported by the facts and the law.” During the hearing, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) questioned department policy encouraging corporate prosecutions to “lean towards leniency,” while there is no analog “if the defendant is a human being.” In response, DOJ pointed to a   that says, “Corporations should not be treated leniently because of their artificial nature nor should they be subject to harsher treatment.” But to Whitehouse’s point, the manual also says prosecutors “may take into account the possibly substantial consequences to a corporation’s employees, investors, pensioners, and customers, many of whom may, depending on the size and nature of the corporation and their role in its operations, have played no role in the criminal conduct, have been unaware of it, have been unable to prevent it, or have been victimized by it.” Street crime offenders, or their relatives who played no role in criminal conduct, aren’t offered the same specified consideration. If the Durbin-Scanlon legislation exposes racial factors in corporate crime prosecution, it could help expose prosecution biases. “Identifying racial disparities in enforcement and sentencing is an important reason for data collection and transparency,” said a congressional aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of committee policy. “It’s important to note that even within white-collar prosecutions, there are racial disparities in outcomes.” Compared to White males, Black men convicted of fraud received prison sentences more than 9 percent longer, and Hispanic males were given almost 13 percent more time, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s November 2023   report. Men categorized as “other race,” however, were penalized with 6 percent less time than White males. Whatever the race of those penalized, they are probably among those Durbin called the “little guys.” “What does it say about the system of justice in America,” he wondered as he adjourned the hearing, “if the big guys are exempt and the little guys go to jail for possession of a handful of crack cocaine for long periods of time?”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRG457XZLII6XEI4KJF4RNUPC4.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRG457XZLII6XEI4KJF4RNUPC4.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRG457XZLII6XEI4KJF4RNUPC4.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRG457XZLII6XEI4KJF4RNUPC4.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRG457XZLII6XEI4KJF4RNUPC4.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRG457XZLII6XEI4KJF4RNUPC4.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/democrats-doj-white-collar-crime/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 06:00:00,

Three years after the Capitol attack, federal judges in Washington have sentenced more than half of the roughly 1,200 people charged in the largest investigation in U.S. history and have handed down lighter punishments for   assault convictions compared with similar assault cases nationally, a Washington Post analysis shows. Judges have ordered prison time for nearly every defendant convicted of a felony and some jail time to about half of those convicted of misdemeanors. But in the vast majority of the more than 700 sentencings to date, judges have issued punishments below government guidelines and prosecutors’ requests. Though more than 60 percent of the defendants sentenced so far have received jail or prison terms, the judges have gone below federal sentencing guidelines in 67 percent of the cases, Post data shows. Nationally, federal judges go below the advisory guidelines about 51 percent of the time, according to federal statistics.

"KHERSON, Ukraine — On the morning of his first crossing of the Dnieper River — where his unit was being sent in a desperate effort to claw back occupied land from Russia — the 21-year-old Ukrainian marine woke up “ready to die.” With their counteroffensive stalled, Ukraine’s military and political leaders were eager to show their Western backers some progress — any progress. KHERSON, Ukraine — On the morning of his first crossing of the Dnieper River — where his unit was being sent in a desperate effort to claw back occupied land from Russia — the 21-year-old Ukrainian marine woke up “ready to die.” With their counteroffensive stalled, Ukraine’s military and political leaders were eager to show their Western backers some progress — any progress. But the 21-year-old marine, Dmytro — who is being identified only by his first name in keeping with Ukrainian military rules — recounted fording a river of death for little reward, aside from some political messaging. Dmytro described being “tossed like a piece of meat to the wolves” during the crossing, which takes 30 minutes to an hour. His account was corroborated by six others involved in the operation to lodge a toehold on the river’s Russian-occupied east bank. “We bear many losses,” said another marine, 22. “We simply lose people, but there is no result.” Frustrated by reports from Ukraine’s Foreign Affairs Ministry — which in November   that it had “managed to consolidate positions on several strongholds” on the Dnieper River — the marines recounted wounded soldiers drowning, unable to swim with their injuries or sucked to the river bottom by their heavy packs. The crossing was so dangerous that the bodies of some marines, killed in the first wave to cross the river two months ago, were left behind. Ukraine does not publicly disclose its number of military casualties and has declined to specify how many marines have been killed in the mission, which seized back just a few square kilometers of land, including a toehold in the fishing village of Krynky. A spokesman for the Ukrainian Marine Corps declined to comment: “We are still in silence on this matter,” he said. But the military acknowledges there have been few gains. “There are no liberated villages,” on the east bank, said Capt. Natalya Humeniuk, head of the joint press center of Ukraine’s Southern Defense Forces. The front lines here had barely budged since the   city, the regional capital, from Russian occupation in November 2022, complicated by mucky terrain and bombed-out bridges. As summer ended, the new mission was launched. Aide and ammunition from the West were at stake, as were the lives of marines and soldiers. As Dmytro left for the crossing, he carried three tins of sardines and six loaves of bread, plus 100 pounds of ammunition and other gear, for an operation that was expected to last a few days — if he survived that long. Just before sunrise, Dmytro’s battalion approached a shallow sandbar and paired off in twos. Morning fog offered some protection from the Russian-operated drones hunting them in the sky. Their goal was to push toward Krynky — 20 miles upriver of Kherson — where Dmytro once visited with his parents. He remembered new fences and a few small shops, now just piles of rubble. As his boots sunk in thick mud, he buried thoughts of his wife and their baby — all soft cheeks and new smiles. Dmytro had learned of the mission a few days in advance and did not think it was well planned. He did not know what awaited them on the east bank. He did not think it was worth his life. It was a sentiment that Johnson — a 40-year-old reconnaissance team leader whom The Washington Post is identifying by his call sign — knew well. In July, he was tasked with clearing the islands that Dmytro was about to navigate. The mission took him across the river six times, most recently in October. The land brimmed with debris left by the Russians — bags of bullets, vials of painkillers, a game of battleship made of paper and blue pen. The reconnaissance team struggled to navigate the shallow marshlands in boats. Johnson was often forced to drag the vessel 65 feet — about the length of a bowling lane — to reach deeper waters. On the east bank, foxholes turned into wells, he said: “A few shovels of land and you’ll be in water.” The positions were shallow and hard to reinforce. The team was unable to build a fire. Clothes stayed damp and cold. Though the Ukrainians succeeded in taking back the islands, the cost was steep. Johnson’s commander died in September in a grenade blast. The marines still crossing continue to face severe danger, he said. “I think it’s unbearable right now,” Johnson said. “I don’t want to be in the positions they are.” On the riverbank, waves slapped the shore, and the marshland rippled in a brisk wind. Two pairs of soldiers took off ahead of Dmytro. He looked to his partner, who cursed. “This plan is” terrible, he said using an expletive. “Well, are you with me?” Dmytro replied. They ran ahead. The shelling began almost immediately. Communication failed, Dmytro said, and the pair could not contact their mortar team to strike back. On the   — which pins the location of video-recorded missile strikes — the river is clotted with dots corroborating accounts of heavy fire. By 8 a.m., only 12 of 30 marines were uninjured. Two died. “We couldn’t fight with people who had tourniquets on them,” Dmytro explained. “We had to wait for new people to replace the people who were injured.” The archipelago of islands had provided good cover, with tall cattails and wide bushes. But over on the east bank, vegetation was sparse. The forest was heavily mined, so the marines dug trenches and covered themselves with sand-filled bags. For almost eight hours, they waited. “When everything explodes from all sides, you begin to live one minute at a time, and you don’t think about anything at all,” Dmytro said. Later, other marines would travel more frequently by boat. “Marines who are getting killed today are the operators of the boats,” said a 39-year-old with the call sign Sawyer. “And this is not something you can learn easily. You have to know how to drive them, you have to know how to think really fast, get faster, get out. … This is a tragedy of course.” After these crossings, the vessels were brought to Vitalii Burgar’s boat shop in Kherson — a Ukrainian-held city scarred by continuous Russian airstrikes, despite President Vladimir Putin’s claims that the city is now part of Russia. Burgar, 52, repaired recreational boats for 20 years, but the war changed things. Now, he is in the business of repairing bullet holes and attaching machine guns. Recently, he restored a boat engine that had been sunk underwater for several months, its wiring stiff with mussels. “You’re either in the military or helping the military,” Burgar said. In mid-December, an explosive Shahed drone hit his shop — “a present from Russia,” he said. But somehow, the work continued. The marines still needed boats. On the east bank, evening fell. With another dozen reinforcements, the marines moved in a line toward Krynky, the group of 45 trudging along in clusters of two and three. Suddenly, Dmytro heard gunfire at their backs. It must be a mistake, he thought. The reconnaissance team had said it was safe, that no one would be around. “Ours!” he shouted, wrongly assuming it was friendly fire. It was the Russians. The marines shot back. They survived the night, fighting toward Krynky, where Ukrainian forces have established a toehold in the ruins of homes, with Russian soldiers nearby ready to seize back the land. On the second day, a grenade exploded, sending a matchstick-sized piece of shrapnel into Dmytro’s hip and giving him a concussion. He was evacuated — carried out over a mangled landscape. In place of trees, a few sticks pierced the ground. The riverbank was churned to glue, the bodies of some fallen marines left behind, unable to be extricated under gunfire. “Everything is mowed down by fragments, just to horror and unrecognizability,” Dmytro said. At least five other men died and 20 were injured by the end of their operation, he said. He was sent home to recover. Upon his return, he was told, he would be sent to the east bank again.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4472KIB7JSLTYTDAXSBGE2UNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4472KIB7JSLTYTDAXSBGE2UNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4472KIB7JSLTYTDAXSBGE2UNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4472KIB7JSLTYTDAXSBGE2UNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4472KIB7JSLTYTDAXSBGE2UNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T4472KIB7JSLTYTDAXSBGE2UNI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/04/kherson-marines-ukraine-villages-russia/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 01:00:00,
"DALLAS — Nathan MacKinnon scored his second goal at 3:40 of overtime as the Colorado Avalanche rallied from a pair of two-goal deficits to beat the Dallas Stars 5-4 on Thursday night. All five Colorado goals came from its top line. Jonathan Drouin had two goals for his seventh career multigoal game and Mikko Rantanen also scored. Alexandar Georgiev stopped 28 shots in his league-leading 21st win and 32nd start.

All five Colorado goals came from its top line. Jonathan Drouin had two goals for his seventh career multigoal game and Mikko Rantanen also scored. Alexandar Georgiev stopped 28 shots in his league-leading 21st win and 32nd start. The Avs have 12 comeback wins, one short of leaders Dallas and New Jersey, and have scored an NHL-best 53 third-period goals. “When we went all the way a couple of years ago and won, we were a really resilient group,” said MacKinnon, who’s tied with Tampa Bay’s Nikita Kucherov with 64 points and was   for the seventh time earlier Thursday. “This year we’re kind of back to that.” Tyler Seguin scored two goals, and Joe Pavelski and Evgenii Dadonov also scored for the Stars. Scott Wedgewood made 29 saves. MacKinnon broke in on a 2-on-0 break with Devon Toews and beat Wedgewood stick side for the game-winner. He also had an assist for the Central Division-leading Avalanche, who have a season-best seven-game points streak (6-0-1). Seguin’s second goal came at 9:07 of the third period for a 4-2 lead. He has four goals against Colorado in two games this season. Less than a minute later, Drouin’s second goal pulled the Avalanche within 4-3. Dallas’ Radek Faksa shot just wide of the empty net from center ice about 40 seconds before Rantanen’s tying goal. “We had the game on our stick a bunch of times down the stretch, including with the empty net to finish it off and didn’t,” Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. “It bit us in the end.” The Avalanche have two come-from-behind wins at Dallas this season. They trailed 3-2 after two periods on Nov. 18 and scored four third-period goals  . Nine of Dallas’ last 10 games have been decided by one goal (5-2-2). Dadonov scored his ninth goal of the season in the first after having scored seven all last season. Defensemen Miro Heiskanen of Dallas and Bowen Byram of Colorado left play during the third period. Heiskanen is Dallas’ top defenseman and leads the team’s blueliners with 26 points. “Obviously, 22-, 24-plus minutes every night — he’s a big part of the team,” Wedgewood said of Heiskanen. Wedgewood is 6-2-2 since replacing Jake Oettinger, who was also named to the NHL All-Star roster and has been sidelined with a lower-body injury since leaving a game on Dec. 15.

"MONTREAL — Buffalo rookie Devon Levi made 32 saves in his first game at hometown Bell Centre to help the Sabres beat the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 on Thursday night. The 22-year-old Levi, from nearby Dollard-des-Ormeaux, grew up watching the Canadiens and idolizing goalie Carey Price. “I’ve dreamt of this moment since I was 5,” Levi said. “It’s incredible to be there, in that crease, after him and a lot of other great goalies, it was a really special night.” MONTREAL — Buffalo rookie Devon Levi made 32 saves in his first game at hometown Bell Centre to help the Sabres beat the Montreal Canadiens 6-1 on Thursday night. The 22-year-old Levi, from nearby Dollard-des-Ormeaux, grew up watching the Canadiens and idolizing goalie Carey Price. “I’ve dreamt of this moment since I was 5,” Levi said. “It’s incredible to be there, in that crease, after him and a lot of other great goalies, it was a really special night.” He said there were 99 family members and friends in attendance. Tage Thompson had two goals and an assist, Jeff Skinner added a goal and three assists, Casey Mittelstadt and Jack Quinn each had a goal and an assist and Rasmus Dahlin scored into an empty net. The Sabres improved to 16-19-4. Joel Armia scored for Montreal, and Jake Allen stopped 32 shots. Returning from a seven-game trip, the Canadiens dropped to 16-17-5. “I think our forecheck was a little off tonight, we were managing the puck poorly, turning pucks over — all the stuff that hurts you,” Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki said. “We just didn’t have our game tonight, we were trying to find it but just didn’t have it.” Levi turned away all 15 shots in the first period and looked prepared early after an especially long morning skate before the game to “take it all in.” The netminder says he normally listens to the Canadiens’ pregame song, “Fix You” by Coldplay, through his headphones before taking the ice. “I didn’t have to tonight because the jumbotron played it for me,” said Levi, who played two seasons at Northeastern. Mittelstadt finished off a feed from Skinner on a power play to open the scoring at 5:33 of the first. Skinner doubled the lead with another power-play goal 1:26 seconds later after Mitchell Stephens took an interference call. The 31-year-old Skinner received a cross-ice pass from Tuch before beating Allen for his 26th goal against the Canadiens — tied with Toronto center Auston Matthews for second-most among active players. Armia got one back on the penalty kill, taking the puck from Dahlin and using him as a screen on a wrist shot over Levi’s left shoulder with 6:41 left in the period. Buffalo squashed Montreal’s momentum in the third period with even-strength goals from Quinn and Thompson, who made it 4-1 at 8:35 by tapping home a feed from Skinner. Levi kept Montreal from clawing back with a point-blank save on Josh Anderson minutes later. After Dahlin scored an empty-net goal with over five minutes left, Levi was at it again, this time by flashing the glove on Cole Caufield. “Tonight is an example of many other nights that he’s turning in a great performance for us,” Buffalo coach Don Granato said. “He’s a talented guy, he has some calm to him, he’s unwavered in lots of instances, so we’re glad to have him.” UP NEXT Sabres: At Pittsburgh on Saturday night.

And executives around the league I’ve chatted with believe at least three more coaches will be let go, and possibly even more, pending Week 18 results. Regardless, plenty of owners continue to confab with their minions, debating the fate of some of their highest-paid employees as the cold, hard truth about another year with no Super Bowl hope and no playoff gates — and, gulp, probably no ticket price hikes, either — takes hold. Someone must pay. Most often, that’s the head coach. “I see seven” coaching changes, predicted one general manager after doing some legwork on the upcoming changes with hopes of filling some spots on his staff. (He spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank about other franchises.) “Maybe eight, because there’s always one nobody saw coming. We’re not just talking two or three.” Another GM, also not allowed to publicly comment on job openings, said: “I’m thinking six or seven, depending on what happens in the playoffs. There could be a few that come after Black Monday.” Here’s one way to classify the likely and potential openings. Anything short of a firing would be shocking. Owner Arthur Blank isn’t a big fan of the work being done by Coach Arthur Smith, and plenty of people around Blank at the most recent league meetings came away thinking a coaching search was imminent. Smith’s painful losses since then haven’t helped, nor has the revolving door at quarterback. “I don’t care what anybody writes; Arthur Smith isn’t safe,” the first GM said. “He’s there for one more week.” The other GM said: “They can’t sell tickets, man. They have all these first-round picks on offense and they can’t score. He has to make a change. You can’t sell Arthur Smith anymore.” Owner David Tepper   Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson again. Maybe he’ll set a record for compensation for a first-time head coach. He outbid himself for the right to hire Matt Rhule, and that was an epic failure. What he will not be doing is hiring Jim Harbaugh. “No chance,” the first GM said. There won’t be a promotion for any interim coaches here. Brandon Staley’s remaining staff members are heading out. Finding the right coach to cull more wins out of quarterback Justin Herbert is the challenge. Johnson will have a lot of steam for this opening, and him sharing an agent with Staley shouldn’t be an issue. Harbaugh badly wants this job, but so do a lot of people. This is over and has been since at least midseason. It still says here Bill Belichick   landing a head coaching job in the NFL. The GMs and execs I speak with still don’t see a fit for him anywhere as more than a vice president of football operations or some such title. Also, his departure opens a general manager spot in New England, and I continue to hear that Texans GM Nick Caserio   to New England if such an arrangement could be worked out. “He’d go back there — trust me,” one GM said. Opinions vary as to whether owner Robert Kraft would consider promoting someone from Belichick’s staff; if their mentor’s options are indeed limited, then his assistants can’t exactly leave with him. Expect to hear plenty more about Titans Coach Mike Vrabel and this opening. Ron Rivera has known this was over for quite some time, and so have many within the organization. The clock has been ticking on his tenure for months. Two GMs told me they expect new owner Josh Harris to hire a GM before he hires a coach. There are rumblings about him looking down the road to the Ravens, whose head of scouting, Joe Hortiz, and defensive coordinator, Mike Macdonald, are very much “it” guys heading into the offseason. “I think [Harris] goes young, someone analytically inclined,” said one longtime NFL executive, who is also not permitted to publicly speculate about front-office hires. “It’s not going to be a retread.” Matt Eberflus has rebounded nicely in the second half and finally has a real defense. But that’s not all that’s being evaluated. Is his staff the right one to break in a new quarterback, with the Bears holding the first pick? That’s the question. “I think [team president] Kevin Warren brings in his own guy,” the first GM said. “Are you handing Caleb Williams to Eberflus and [offensive coordinator Luke] Getsy? After how it went with [2021 first-round pick Justin] Fields?” The second GM said: “They’re taking a QB and starting over with him. They’re going to have two top-10 picks. That’s a very attractive job. I wouldn’t be surprised if Kevin looked around.” Former head coaches such as Harbaugh and Leslie Frazier have strong Bears ties. Mark Davis should promote  . But no one I spoke to was convinced that’s how this will go down. There’s one more game — Sunday vs. the Denver Broncos — to evaluate the situation. They’re stuck with middling QB Derek Carr for another year and won too many games to be in position to land one of the top three or four QBs in the draft. That might save Coach Dennis Allen for another season, but I wouldn’t call it a lock he returns. “I really think they’d hire Jon Gruden if the league would let them get away with it,” the first GM said. “They already pissed [Commissioner Roger] Goodell off by hiring him as a consultant.” If they manage to blow the NFC South title — and it would take losing to the two-win Panthers on Sunday to open that door — then anything short of a firing would be an upset. Ownership has been mulling options for weeks, with Todd Bowles not assured of another season. And even if the Bucs make the playoffs, both GMs and the personnel executive I spoke with believe an ugly first-round exit could portend change. Quarterback Baker Mayfield is not a sure thing to return, either, especially if there is a GM change. Mike McCarthy’s notorious game- and clock-management woes were overshadowed by   last week that gifted his team a win over the Detroit Lions. But the Cowboys still tend to come up small when it matters most, and with a division title theirs for the taking, they had best back that up with a strong playoff showing. “If Mike [soils] the bed in the playoffs they’ll just promote [defensive coordinator] Dan Quinn,” the first GM said. “That could definitely happen.” The personnel executive predicted owner Jerry Jones “won’t be cool with a one-and-done.” I keep hearing Vrabel and GM Ran Carthon are not a match. This looks like a rebuilding team, and Vrabel would have trade value. Rival officials believe the Bears and Patriots would covet Vrabel. The Titans could turn to their former assistant, Arthur Smith (if he’s out in Atlanta), and see if he can develop quarterback Will Levis. The Titans are 0-5 in the weak AFC South, are 5-18 in their past 23 games and have gone 34 straight contests without scoring 30 points, the longest streak in the NFL and a franchise record. “I could see a trade,” the first GM said. The second GM said: “I know it’s not good there between the coach and GM. I think something could happen.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5DJYIYXFH4BK5DES24LTIJOE.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5DJYIYXFH4BK5DES24LTIJOE.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5DJYIYXFH4BK5DES24LTIJOE.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5DJYIYXFH4BK5DES24LTIJOE.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5DJYIYXFH4BK5DES24LTIJOE.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CA5DJYIYXFH4BK5DES24LTIJOE.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/02/nfl-coaches-hot-seat/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 11:56:00,
"JERUSALEM — Tariq’s neighborhood in Gaza’s Jabalya Camp was rapidly becoming a war zone when he and his family of eight fled Israeli bombing in November. When he returned home Sunday — after weeks spent scrounging for food, on the run from artillery and firefights — it was unrecognizable. “What remained was half a house,” he told The Washington Post on Wednesday. “Ruins we could live on.” JERUSALEM — Tariq’s neighborhood in Gaza’s Jabalya Camp was rapidly becoming a war zone when he and his family of eight fled Israeli bombing in November. When he returned home Sunday — after weeks spent scrounging for food, on the run from artillery and firefights — it was unrecognizable. “What remained was half a house,” he told The Washington Post on Wednesday. “Ruins we could live on.” Tariq, who spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his first name out of concern for his safety, was among the first displaced residents to venture back to homes in Gaza this week   from the north. They encountered destroyed buildings, ravaged roads, piles of rubble — some with decaying corpses still uncollected — and huge uncertainty about their future. Amid the gradual downshift from full-scale war in some parts of Gaza, the fate of the enclave and its 2.1 million inhabitants remains far from clear. As some residents trickle back to their ruined neighborhoods, prominent politicians in Israel have questioned whether they should go home at all. Controversial proposals from some Israeli officials to evacuate Gazans to camps in Egypt or other countries are causing rifts with Washington, Europe and the United Nations, and have been included in a case filed against Israel at the International Court of Justice alleging “genocide” in Gaza. Far-right members of the governing coalition have proposed sending displaced Palestinians to Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the European Union or Chile. The Post   that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had urged   and other U.S. officials to pressure Egypt to open its border with Gaza and accept Palestinian refugees. A   in Israeli media last week said Netanyahu was in discussions with the Democratic Republic of Congo to receive “voluntary migration” from Gaza. Netanyahu’s office and the Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment. The Congolese government did not respond to requests for comment. Critics say such proposals could amount to the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian enclave. “Forced displacements are strictly prohibited as a grave violation of [international humanitarian law] & words matter,” Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, wrote Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter, in response to calls by Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister   for Palestinians to leave Gaza. “What needs to be done in the Gaza Strip is to encourage emigration,” Smotrich   in an interview Sunday with Israeli Army Radio. “If there are 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza and not 2 million Arabs, the entire discussion on the day after will be totally different.” Ben Gvir echoed that call Tuesday,   on X, that “the migration of hundreds of thousands from Gaza will allow the residents of the enclave to return home and live in security and protect [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers.” U.S. officials say they have been reassured that the proposals do not represent official Israeli policy. But the State Department on Tuesday issued a rebuke to Smotrich and Ben Gvir: “This rhetoric is inflammatory and irresponsible,” spokesman Matthew Miller said in a  . “We have been clear, consistent, and unequivocal that Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land.” In private, Israeli officials say the proposals stem from the political imperatives of Netanyahu’s coalition and his dependence on far-right parties to maintain power. Ben Gvir and Smotrich are excluded from the  , where security policy is being set. But their statements play well among religious settlers and activists who would like to see Israel annex Gaza rather than turn it over to a “revitalized” Palestinian Authority, as U.S. officials have advocated. “The professionals in the military and the security establishment know this is not even in the realm of possibility,” said a person directly familiar with conversations inside the government, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. “They know there is no future without Gazans in Gaza and the PA as part of the government.” But the relocation proposals, and Netanyahu’s refusal to refute them, continue to roil relations with the international community as opposition grows to Israel’s war on  , which has killed more than 22,000 people in Gaza and displaced nearly 90 percent of its inhabitants. “This really is Israel shooting itself in the foot,” Shira Efron, director of research at the Israel Policy Forum, said of the proposals. “It would help if Netanyahu came out in his voice and said this is not the policy, but it’s election season and he has to cater to his base.” Next week, Israel will respond to charges brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide or a failure to prevent genocide. Ten pages of the   are devoted to Israeli officials and soldiers, in their own words, calling for the forcible transfer of Palestinians and the destruction of Gaza. Israel vociferously disputes the claims, which spokesman Eylon Levy called “South Africa’s absurd blood libel.” “We have been clear in word and in deed that we are targeting the Oct. 7 monsters and are innovating ways to uphold international law, including the principles of proportionality, precaution and distinction in the context of a counterterror battlefield no army has faced before,” Levy said at a briefing. But even some international law experts who believe Israel is adhering to the laws of war say the rhetoric coming from the far right undermines the country’s defense. “It’s truly disturbing to look at the list,” Amichai Cohen, a law professor at Israel’s Ono Academic College, said of the statements compiled by South Africa. “Even though I know that most of these were either made by people who have no seat at the decision-making table or were taken out of context.” For all the devastation in Gaza, and the fears that much of it has been rendered unlivable, Tariq and other Gazans who ventured homeward told The Post they will never leave. We “would rather die and be buried under the soil of Gaza than go out and live in any other country,” Tariq said. His family saw fewer tanks on the perilous journey home, and the sounds of gunfire and artillery were more sporadic. But their community was in ruins. “The streets, schools, infrastructure, everything here was completely destroyed,” Tariq said. The reports of relative calm also brought Moamen al-Harthani, 29, and his family back to their Jabalya neighborhood Sunday. His hopes for their five-story building were dashed as soon as he reached his block: It was completely demolished. “I couldn’t remove even a single piece of fabric,” he said. As they surveyed the neighborhood, they found boxes of spent ammunition and, in one house, plastic handcuffs. The walls of some homes were spattered in blood, he said, and others had Hebrew words carved into them. Still, Harthani is determined to stay and rebuild. “How can you think that I will leave Gaza?” he asked. “All I ask now is for the war to end and for me to live on the rubble of my house.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXN2JB6HOJMGLHNMEYADUVMCMA.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXN2JB6HOJMGLHNMEYADUVMCMA.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXN2JB6HOJMGLHNMEYADUVMCMA.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXN2JB6HOJMGLHNMEYADUVMCMA.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXN2JB6HOJMGLHNMEYADUVMCMA.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXN2JB6HOJMGLHNMEYADUVMCMA.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/04/gaza-displaced-civilians-resettlement-israel/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 12:39:00,

TEMPE, Ariz. — Bo Horvat scored twice, the second in New York’s three-goal third period, and Ilya Sorokin made 25 saves to help the Islanders beat the Arizona Coyotes 5-1 on Thursday night. Anders Lee and Julien Gauthier scored 52 seconds apart for a 4-1 lead early in the third, and Horvat skated in alone for an unassisted goal with seven minutes remaining. Matthew Barzal had two assists to give him 401 points in the NHL. Barzal, named to his third All-Star team Thursday, has six assists in his last six games. Horvat added an assist. “Anders did his thing, and I thought that both Bo and ‘Barzy’ were skating determined,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “Very solid, steady play away from the puck, both of them. As a result they had some opportunities and got some numbers.” Mike Reilly also scored for the Islanders, who had lost three of four. Sorokin had three shutouts in five previous games against Arizona. “Pretty much all our goals came off the forecheck, so that was big for us,” said Barzal, whose team is 1-1-1 on a four-game trip following a 5-4 overtime loss at Colorado on Tuesday night. “The last game in Colorado was not my line’s best, so we needed to bounce back.” Nick Schmaltz scored and Connor Ingram made 23 saves for Arizona. The Coyotes have lost two in a row after winning six of seven.. “That’s when you learn the most, when things aren’t going your way,” said Coyotes forward Clayton Keller, named to his fourth All-Star team. “You have to dig deep, and that’s why I love this game so much. All the challenges, the setbacks, and the adversity.” Lee scored on an open chance from the slot at 4:49 of the third, when Barzal got a stick on an attempted clearing pass and it deflected to Lee. Gauthier carried the puck from his end and scored on a first short from the left circle. “We came out really well in the third period,” Horvat said. “Something that we haven’t done in the past, and tonight I thought we did a great job of that.” Horvat opened the scoring at 7:56 of the first period, 11 seconds into a power play. Noah Dobson slapped a rolling puck from the right circle that ricocheted off an defender right to Horvat, who put a quick wrister past Ingram from the slot. Reilly made it 2-0 four minutes later, when he scored on a wrist shot from the low left circle. An Arizona turnover in the Islanders’ end led to a quick 3-on-1 break. Schmaltz scored on a power play 3:29 into the second period to make it 2-1. The Coyotes had a 5-on-3 advantage for nine seconds after consecutive New York penalties and Schmaltz scored four seconds after the first penalty expired. The Coyotes played without forward Jason Zucker, who served the first game of a three-game suspension after taking a boarding penalty against Florida on Tuesday night. Islanders defenseman Robert Bortuzzo was placed on injured reserve before the game because of a lower-body injury. He was checked into the boards in the second period of a 5-4 overtime loss at Colorado on Tuesday night. New York goalie Semyon Varlamov also sustained a lower-body injury in Colorado and was not available. Goalie Ken Appleby was recalled from American Hockey League Bridgeport.

(R) managed to accomplish something on Thursday evening that has often proved elusive over the past year: identify a subject on which DeSantis was willing to distance himself from  . Ronald Langel,   by host Kaitlan Collins, asked DeSantis to define the term “patriotism.” He offered an example to evaluate: “Did the January 6th insurrectionists display patriotism as some of them claim they did?” “No. Of course not,” DeSantis replied. “I mean, that was not a good day for the country.” He went on a bit, first disparaging how “the left” and “the media” have “politicized” the Capitol riot, as though the events of that day were otherwise removed from politics. But that immediate response, that rejection of the idea that the rioters were engaged in patriotic acts, is telling — both about him and about Trump. Langel framed the question in a way that presented the riot participants themselves as identifying their actions as patriotic. Some have. But so have prominent Republican elected officials, including Rep.   (R-Ariz.) and Donald Trump himself. Campaigning in New Hampshire last April, he hugged a woman who had recently been released from prison after being sentenced for her participation in the riot. Trump   that the treatment of the   “patriots” was “so bad.” This is not a universal sentiment among Republicans or Trump supporters, but it’s not a particularly unusual one. Polling released last year by the  , conducted by YouGov, shows that about 1 in 6 Americans think that “patriot” is a good descriptor for those who participated in the events at the Capitol, with that number jumping to 3 in 10 among Republicans. Republicans were only slightly more likely to describe the participants as “rioters.” Overall, Americans were twice as likely to describe the participants as “terrorists” rather than “patriots.” Asked how they would describe what unfolded at the Capitol on Jan. 6 in general, Republicans surveyed in   (also conducted by YouGov) were more likely to describe the riot as “patriotism” than “an insurrection.” About half of Republicans used the former term. And that was two years ago; Washington Post   shows that support for riot participants has grown over time. These numbers are also interesting given how Langel framed his question, describing those who participated as “insurrectionists.” Only 1 in 10 Republicans used that term in the U-Mass. Amherst poll, but DeSantis didn’t object to Langel’s use of it. Support for describing the rioters as “patriots,” though, is low enough that DeSantis — historically attuned to the temperature of the right’s online conversations — didn’t hesitate to reject it. And, by extension, to reject Trump’s framing. There’s a reason that Trump is inclined to say that he views riot participants as patriots. Even if he didn’t actually think they were, it’s useful for him personally to describe them as victims of overzealous, anti-American prosecutors. After all, he has relentlessly tried to frame his own prosecutions in the same way; by hyping the idea that Jan. 6 rioters are docile American patriots, he can present federal charges as a universal response to those who share his philosophy, rather than as an obvious response to his own actions. But Trump probably actually   see the protesters as patriots. After all, Trump’s view of patriotism and America mirrors Louis XIV’s apocryphal assessment of France: L’etat, c’est moi. I   the state and it is me. To be a patriotic American is to support Donald Trump — which the rioters very much were doing. The CBS poll included a follow-up question for those who described the events of Jan. 6 as patriotism: Why did they think that? Nearly two-thirds said it was because they were “standing up for Trump.” This is also why Trump would not be inclined to view the rioters as “insurrectionists”: They were  America in his view, which is to say, defending him. This presentation by Trump is long-standing. During his presidency and, particularly during the 2020 election campaign, he presented the resources of the presidency as his own and framed the election as an effort to strip him of his rightful power. Then, of course, he battled the results of the election he lost, leading to the events at the Capitol. DeSantis obviously doesn’t view the presidency that way and, therefore, isn’t willing to state that the riot was somehow a demonstration of patriotism. Many Republicans are skeptical of the term, however sympathetic they might be to the rioters’ desired outcome. And the Florida governor clearly doesn’t share Trump’s view that Trump is the natural, legitimate possessor of the presidency. Unfortunately for DeSantis, far more Republicans see Trump as the natural choice for president in 2025 than see him that way.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7JT7ZWKXVC57E3XMKHYKAWOCI.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7JT7ZWKXVC57E3XMKHYKAWOCI.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7JT7ZWKXVC57E3XMKHYKAWOCI.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7JT7ZWKXVC57E3XMKHYKAWOCI.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7JT7ZWKXVC57E3XMKHYKAWOCI.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7JT7ZWKXVC57E3XMKHYKAWOCI.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/trump-desantis-jan6-patriotism/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 10:14:00,
"Glynis Johns, an actress who became a British film star in the late 1940s playing a flirty mermaid named Miranda, portrayed a singing suffragist in the Disney musical “Mary Poppins” and won a Tony Award in the musical “A Little Night Music,” where she introduced Stephen Sondheim’s standard “Send in the Clowns,” died Jan. 4 at an assisted-living home in Los Angeles. She was 100. Glynis Johns, an actress who became a British film star in the late 1940s playing a flirty mermaid named Miranda, portrayed a singing suffragist in the Disney musical “Mary Poppins” and won a Tony Award in the musical “A Little Night Music,” where she introduced Stephen Sondheim’s standard “Send in the Clowns,” died Jan. 4 at an assisted-living home in Los Angeles. She was 100. Her manager, Mitch Clem, confirmed the death but did not provide a specific cause. Ms. Johns’s effervescence and crackling husky voice — which she attributed to “slightly twisted” vocal cords that permitted the air to hit “the soprano and the contralto at the same time” — made her a distinctive presence in nearly 60 films, dozens of TV appearances and scores of theatrical productions. Film historian David Shipman once described Ms. Johns, with her blend of sex appeal and quirky charm, as “one of the more entrancing heroines of the ’40s, one of the very few in British films who knew how to play comedy.” She became a top box-office draw in England but found little pleasure in stardom, telling a reporter: “It is not a pleasant way of earning a living. … It has made me ill, exhausted and unhappy.” She attributed the failure of at least one of her four marriages to the pressures of being a leading lady. Nevertheless, by the early 1960s, she had settled into a long and varied career as a character actress, enlivening even middling fare with her offbeat allure. Ms. Johns represented the fourth generation in a show-business family. Her parents, who were touring in South Africa with a musical revue when she was born, settled in England, where Ms. Johns studied ballet so intensely that she earned a teaching certificate at age 10. Her china-blue eyes, her athleticism and her voice (“like honey over graham crackers,” one arts writer rhapsodized) propelled her stage and film career. After several juvenile on-screen roles, she achieved breakthrough stardom with   (1948) as a fishtailed seductress whose flowing blond hair provides strategic cover of her upper body. The film, a comic fantasy with a sexually forward heroine, was a commercial smash. Ms. Johns reprised the part in the 1954 Technicolor sequel, “Mad About Men,” and racked up a slew of credits in other films, few of any consequence. Yet Ms. Johns was usually singled out for spirited work, whether opposite James Stewart in the aviation drama “No Highway in the Sky” (1951), Alec Guinness in the comic satire “The Promoter” (1952) or   in the live-action Disney swashbucklers “The Sword and the Rose” and “Rob Roy” (both 1953). In Hollywood, she played a   in “The Court Jester” (1956), a musical comedy set in medieval England and starring Danny Kaye. That same year, she and Hermione Gingold made brief appearances as “sporting ladies” — prostitutes — in the all-star vehicle “Around the World in 80 Days.” She drew an Academy Award nomination for her supporting role as an earthy innkeeper in “The Sundowners” (1960), a drama set in the Australian outback with Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr. “Mary Poppins” (1964) was a showcase for Julie Andrews as the singing English nursemaid, but Ms. Johns proved delightfully eccentric and a   in the supporting part of the children’s mother, Mrs. Banks. On television, Ms. Johns starred with Keith Andes in short-lived CBS sitcom “Glynis” (1963), about a husband-and-wife team of amateur sleuths, and she played the henchwoman Lady Penelope Peasoup on the 1960s series “Batman,” among other guest roles. She also slummed in low-grade horror movies, all the while maintaining a vigorous theatrical career. The show that dominated her résumé was Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler’s “A Little Night Music” (1973), inspired by  droll romantic roundelay “Smiles of a Summer Night” (1955). Ms. Johns had been cast as the world-weary courtesan and actress Desiree Armfeldt on the basis of her acting strengths more than her voice. Director and producer   said that on the day of a preview for a VIP audience, Sondheim had come to work bleary-eyed after an all-nighter spent writing a song: “Send In the Clowns,” a bittersweet ballad about life’s missed chances. He and Ms. Johns “adored it,” Prince recalled to Sondheim biographer Meryle Secrest. “And, talk about the guts of a jailbird, Glynis said, ‘If you’ll put the lyrics on a piece of paper I’ll sing it in front of the audience today.’” Sondheim later told Secrest that he had tailored the song to what Secrest called Ms. Johns’s “small, silvery voice” and that “nobody can sing it as well as she.” Its word choices — from the well-known first line,   — made the most of her limits by forcing a breath after the “ch” sound. In Sondheim’s judgment, professional singers who later recorded it — including Frank Sinatra and Judy Collins — were, in effect, too expert at smooth phrasing to capture its bitter essence. The show, which ran 601 performances, garnered five other Tonys in addition to Ms. Johns’s win for best actress in a musical, including best musical. She later told the Associated Press that “Send In the Clowns” was “the greatest gift I’ve ever been given in the theater.” Glynis Margaret Johns was born in Pretoria, South Africa, on Oct. 5, 1923. Her father was the Welsh-born actor Mervyn Johns. Her mother, Australian-born concert pianist Alys Steele-Payne, came from a family of entertainers. After several theater roles in London, notably as a cruel student in Lillian Hellman’s “The Children’s Hour,” Ms. Johns was signed to a film contract and excelled as Ralph Richardson’s high-strung adolescent daughter in “South Riding” (1938). Her career received a major boost when she appeared with Laurence Olivier in “49th Parallel” (1941), as a   who encounters stranded German U-boat crew members. Ms. Johns played opposite her father as the daughter of a mysterious innkeeper in the ghost story “The Halfway House” (1944), and she brought a worldly zest to the role of a friend who helps liberate Kerr from the routine of married life in “Vacation From Marriage” (1945). Among her later supporting roles, she lent a much-needed spark to “The Chapman Report” (1962), as a poetry-spouting housewife who propositions a football-playing Adonis only to find him a boorish lover. She also transcended the lifeless comedy “Lock Up Your Daughters!” (1969) as the gleefully lecherous Mrs. Squeezum. In some of her final screen performances, she was the callous mother of Kevin Spacey in “The Ref” (1994) and a grandmother in the Sandra Bullock romantic comedy “While You Were Sleeping” (1995). Onstage, Ms. Johns made a strong impression in a 1956 Broadway revival of George Bernard Shaw’s “Major Barbara,” portraying the idealistic title character opposite Charles Laughton as her munitions-maker father, and as four long-suffering women in John Mortimer’s sex comedy “Come As You Are,” a London hit in 1970. Her appearance with Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger in a 1989 Broadway revival of W. Somerset Maugham’s romantic comedy “The Circle” was seen by critics largely as a chance to catch the three veteran performers — “sly old foxes at play,” as New York Times reviewer Frank Rich noted. Ms. Johns, who retired in her late 70s, admitted to not feeling like a “whole person” offstage, and colleagues described her as insecure and even frightened when not performing. Andes, her sitcom co-star, once told TV Guide: “Glynis is a whole crowd of people. You’re never sure which one you’ll meet from hour to hour.” Her marriages were short-lived. Her first, to actor Anthony Forwood, took a startling turn when he left her for movie star Dirk Bogarde. Her later marriages to business executives David Foster and Cecil Henderson and author Elliott Arnold ended in divorce. A son from her first marriage, Gareth Forwood, died in 2007. Survivors include a grandson and three great-grandchildren, her manager said. “I became a professional at 12, so it’s always been my life,” Ms. Johns once told the Times, looking back on her time as an actress. “Later on, I wanted to lead what I thought of as a ‘normal’ existence, but I soon found I wasn’t as normal away from the theater as in it,” she continued. “Acting is my highest form of intelligence, the time when I use the best part of my brain. I was always told, by my married friends, for example, that I could apply that intelligence to something else, some other aspect of living, but I can’t. I don’t have the same flair in other things.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JKNIIWVKXOLTX3OPZ4LG6XFFTY.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JKNIIWVKXOLTX3OPZ4LG6XFFTY.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JKNIIWVKXOLTX3OPZ4LG6XFFTY.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JKNIIWVKXOLTX3OPZ4LG6XFFTY.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JKNIIWVKXOLTX3OPZ4LG6XFFTY.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JKNIIWVKXOLTX3OPZ4LG6XFFTY.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/04/glynis-johns-actress-dead-obituary/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 14:46:00,
"ST. LOUIS — Robert Thomas had a goal and an assist to lead the St. Louis Blues over the Vancouver Canucks 2-1 on Thursday night. Thomas, selected to his first All-Star Game earlier in the day, broke a 1-all tie at 8:03 of the third period, picking the top left corner of the net from the high slot for his team-leading 16th goal of the season. ST. LOUIS — Robert Thomas had a goal and an assist to lead the St. Louis Blues over the Vancouver Canucks 2-1 on Thursday night. Thomas, selected to his first All-Star Game earlier in the day, broke a 1-all tie at 8:03 of the third period, picking the top left corner of the net from the high slot for his team-leading 16th goal of the season. “I think he’s becoming a more mature professional hockey player and understanding what he needs to do as a player to give our team an opportunity to have success,” Blues interim coach Drew Bannister said. “I think the offensive side comes very easy to him. Obviously, he has to work at it, but he sees the ice so well. He’s shooting the puck a lot more. He’s built that into his game,” Bannister added. “The defensive side for any skilled hockey player is always the one thing that kind of lags a little bit, but I think with Robby, we’re starting to see him really mature into a really good two-way hockey player.” Thomas gave credit to teammates Pavel Buchnevich, Scott Perunovich and Jordan Kyrou on the game-winner. “I just found it over the blocker,” Thomas said. “A lot of guys did a lot of good things for that goal.” Thomas, an Aurora, Ontario native, said being able to play in the All-Star Game in Toronto near his hometown is extra special. “My family and friends are so excited,” he said. “My grandma is super stoked to be there. It should be a cool experience for all of us.” Colton Parayko also scored for the Blues, who snapped a two-game skid. Jordan Binnington made 25 saves to improve to 12-11-1. Conor Garland scored for the Canucks, who had won eight of 11. Thatcher Demko made 30 saves but fell to 18-8-1. “I thought we missed a glorious chance in the third,” coach Rick Tocchet said. “We had four or five missed nets. We’ve got to hit the net on those shots.” The Blues have earned points in six straight home games against Vancouver, going 4-0-2 during that span. Garland’s one-timer from the high slot off Teddy Blueger’s feed gave the Canucks the lead at 1:57 of the first period. Demko held his post to thwart Jake Neighbours’ rush late in the first and stopped all 11 shots by the Blues in the opening period. Parayko evened it at 4:22 of the second, ringing a wrister off the post for his seventh goal of the season. Parayko played in his 614th career game to tie Barclay Plager for fourth-most among defensemen in Blues history. “It was an early one that we gave up, so we rebounded good,” Parayko said. “I think our group is hungry right now and we know where we are. And it’s a tough division that we’re in, so we’ve got to continue to get points, to stick with games and not let things like that kind of get us down.” Binnington kept it tied with a big save late in the second after Garland found himself alone at the net due to a Blues turnover. Canucks defenseman Quinn Hughes had his five-game point streak snapped, but was chosen for the All-Star Game for the fourth time in his six-year career. “It’s a great honor,” Hughes said. “It’s hard to get in there. I believe we’ve got four or five guys that should be in there.” UP NEXT Canucks: Play at New Jersey on Saturday night.

"At age 8, Gabrielle Day squeezed onto the couch in front of the television at her family’s condo in Panama. She was excited to watch swimming phenom Katie Ledecky compete in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro  . As Day’s mother, Michelle, made dinner, she worried her daughter might not be looking at the bigger picture. At age 8, Gabrielle Day squeezed onto the couch in front of the television at her family’s condo in Panama. She was excited to watch swimming phenom Katie Ledecky compete in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro  . As Day’s mother, Michelle, made dinner, she worried her daughter might not be looking at the bigger picture. “Hey, why not watch Simone Manuel?” Michelle called out from the kitchen. Day glanced at her mom, perhaps wondering why she would focus on anyone other than Ledecky. Then she peeked at the television again and saw Manuel was one of only two Black women on the U.S. swim team. “You’re right; she looks like me, ” Day recalls saying. In Rio, Manuel would become  More than seven years later, the Day family remembers that conversation as the first time Gabrielle recognized her distinctiveness. Now, as the top girls’ swimmer at Bullis, she deals with internal conflict: her love for the sport vs. the discomfort of being one of few Black girls participating. Swimming is one of the least diverse sports in the United States. A 2021 demographics report from USA Swimming said just 1.4 percent of its 200,000-plus year-round swimmers identified as African American or Black. (Twenty-nine percent did not respond to the ethnicity question.) In a sport dominated by White athletes, talented young Black swimmers feel the added pressure of participating in an arena in which, as Day puts it, “nobody else looks like me.” Day planned to compete competitively since she waddled into a pool, but for other Black swimmers, the decision came much later. Bullis senior Joshua Black briefly participated in swim lessons when he was little but did not step back into the water until he was 14. by the USA Swimming Foundation and the University of Memphis, 64 percent of African American children have little to no swimming ability — 24 percent more than White children. Institutional racism and cost are at the heart of the disparity. After the desegregation of pools in the late 1940s, the overall attendance of municipal pools plummeted  , where discrimination against Black people was allowed, according to Jeff Wiltse, author of “Contested Waters: A Social History of Swimming Pools in America.” “There is a stereotype that Black kids can’t swim, and therefore we wanted to make sure that our kid could swim,” Michelle Day said. “It’s not a stereotype for no reason. There’s historical reasons.” Swimming is also a less popular sport for African American children to try. Black grew up in Prince George’s County, which has produced some of the top basketball players in the country. He tried basketball and football before he started swimming competitively because that’s where his community was visibly represented. When Black would tell peers he was attending a swim practice, he would brace for questions. “We still need more Black gold medalists where they reach that top stage,” Black said. “Right now, I feel like [Black kids] default to [other sports].” Matthew Brannagan, the swimming coach and a social studies teacher at Frederick Douglass High, said students at the Upper Marlboro public school are programmed from a young age to want to play basketball or football. Between the lack of flashiness and dearth of role models in swimming, Brannagan said most athletes are unaware of the opportunities and scholarships that are available. USA Swimming, the national governing body for the sport,   in 2023 to focus on supporting clubs led by women and/or racially diverse participants and clubs that partner with historically Black colleges and universities. Though that funding only goes so far, many have taken note and see it as an invitation for inclusion. When Day steps out of the pool after a heat, it is easy to notice a difference between her and her teammates. Strolling around the pool deck, other swimmers have ripped their head caps off, while the freshman has to leave hers on for an extended period so her hair doesn’t get damaged. In the locker room, teammates will ask her, “How do you fit your hair in your cap?” or “Why don’t you have to wash or redo your braids?” Such questions remind Day of the differences between her and other swimmers. She recognizes how the consistent cues of being an outsider can discourage Black children from getting into the sport. “The lack of diversity can drive someone away,” she said. There are other blatant examples of racism that Black high school swimmers have experienced. Douglass has a team exclusively of people of color; the school’s  . In 2017, the Eagles’ swimmers were in the locker room when they overheard another team making racist remarks. “Make sure you shower off because of all the Afro Sheen in the water,” Brannagan, who is White, recalls swimmers from the opposing team saying. Brannagan said the treatment made his swimmers feel as if they did not belong. “Then, when my kids light them up and beat a lot of them, it’s definitely a lot of: ‘What? Where’d they learn how to swim?’ ” Brannagan said. Black said when he started swimming, doubt from the nearly all-White crowds added pressure to perform well. He wanted to beat any stereotypes. Black and Day are among a diverse team at Bullis, but both said there are few Black swimmers on their club teams. Black has learned to drown out those implications. “Before, I was swimming for other people, trying to prove them wrong,” he said. “Now I’m more so swimming for myself and the goals I want to achieve.” Joseph J. Lawrence Pool at St. Albans has a narrow deck, waves of heat rolling off the 83-degree pool and huddled swimmers to create a sticky atmosphere. In a meet with Bullis, Georgetown Day and Flint Hill, more than 75 swimmers stand together in anticipation of their individual heats. Despite the large number of swimmers, a clear disparity exists. Nearly every swimmer from Georgetown Day and Flint Hill is White, while 45 percent of swimmers donning blue and gold are not, Bullis Coach Valerie Simon counts. That’s not surprising, considering Simon’s backstory. The second-year coach swam under famous swim coach Jim Ellis, who in 1971 founded the Philadelphia Department of Recreation swim team, one of the only all-Black teams in the country. The story of the club is captured in the 2007 film “Pride.” More than 100 of the team’s members attended college to swim, including Simon. Alongside her sister, Vanessa, Simon was the first Black female swimmer at West Virginia University in 1993. Ellis, who was inducted into the American Swimming Coaches Association Hall of Fame, always reminded Simon to deal with any racism she faced in the water. Simon now emulates Ellis’s confidence. As she walks down the pool deck, the meet schedule clenched tightly in her right hand, she projects instructions to her 34 swimmers. Simon’s story has already made an impact on the Bulldogs. When she took over, Bullis barely had enough swimmers to field a competitive roster. The coach’s history also played a role in Black’s and Day’s decisions to attend the Potomac private school. Of the four schools Day toured, Bullis had the only minority swim coach. “It played a huge role because having a coach and being able to look up to someone for help and advice who’s like me and has been in my position before, it’s inspiring,” Day said. At the Dec. 14 meet, Black and Day dominated for Bullis. Black won the boys’ 200-yard individual medley, and Day swept her individual heats, winning the girls’ 100-yard butterfly and 100-yard backstroke. Much has changed since Simon swam competitively, she said. There are club teams such as Kingfish Swimming (for which Black competed) that feature almost all Black swimmers. USA Swimming has created an outreach program to encourage economically disadvantaged youth to become USA Swimming year-round athlete members at a reduced fee. The sport is still nowhere close to being equitable. Changing that will require swimmers such as Day to become visible in the Black community. An overhaul, beginning at the youth level, will take time. “There are just so many avenues that weren’t available when we were younger,” Simon said. “Is the access equitable? No, it is not. But is there access? Yes, there is.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXSHILZRNURT75SDMBAQYJVXLQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXSHILZRNURT75SDMBAQYJVXLQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXSHILZRNURT75SDMBAQYJVXLQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXSHILZRNURT75SDMBAQYJVXLQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXSHILZRNURT75SDMBAQYJVXLQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LXSHILZRNURT75SDMBAQYJVXLQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/black-swimmers/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 09:30:00,

ANAHEIM, Calif. — Auston Matthews scored 2:12 into overtime and the Toronto Maple Leafs rallied for a 2-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Wednesday night, squeaking by after taking 57 shots on goal. Martin Jones made 27 saves in his second standout performance in two nights after earning the shutout over Los Angeles on Tuesday. John Tavares scored with just under six minutes remaining in regulation to send the game into the extra period. Matthews delivered his 30th of the season in overtime to beat Ducks goaltender Lukas Dostal, who had a career-high 55 saves. The score came on a pass from the slot by Mitchell Marner, with Matthews delivering his game winner just inside the right post. The goal came on Matthews’ 13th shot of the game, with his 30 goals coming in 35 games. “He’s due every night with the amount of looks he gets and obviously just how elite of a player he is and how is able to find space and opportunities for himself,” Tavares said. “He knows where to be on the ice, to get pucks off the pass and get the looks he gets and how he can generate stuff out of nothing. He can score from anywhere.” It is Matthews’ eighth season with at least 30 toals, tied for fifth most among U.S.-born players, Joe Mullin has the most 30-goal seasons among U.S.-born players with 10. Only six players have more 30-goal seasons from the start of their career in NHL history. “He’s found another level here in the last month or so,” Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said. “I don’t know how many he could have had. He finishes with 13 shots and 20 attempts, so he was bound to get one and it was obviously a big one for us.” Frank Vatrano scored for the Ducks, who lost their third-consecutive game and fell to 1-5-0 on a season-high eight game homestand. The Maple Leafs lost forward Bobby McMann to a game misconduct for boarding on the Ducks’ Pavel Mintyukov in the second period. After leaving briefly when he hit the edge of the boards with his right cheekbone, Minyyukov returned later in the period. After a scoreless first period when the Maple Leafs doubled up the Ducks 18-9 in shots, it was Anaheim that struck first in the middle period. Vatrano’s goal at 11:41 was officially considered short-handed since it came just after a 4-on-4 situation. Before the Maple Leafs could take advantage of the extra man, Anaheim forced a turnover in the Toronto zone and Mason McTavish found Vatrano in front of the goal with a pass from the right faceoff spot. Dostal continued to fend off the Toronto pressure, making 33 of his saves by the end of the second period while starting for the first time in four games in place of John Gibson. “When he’s out and he’s attacking, he’s an aggressive goalie and he’s hard to beat,” Ducks coach Greg Cronin said of Dostal. “He’s not one of those 6-foot-5 guys that are across rosters. He’s a smaller guy, but he’s really quick.” The Maple Leafs finally scored with 5:43 remaining in regulation when Tavares pounced on a loose puck in front of the Ducks goal and scored his 12th of the season on the power play. Morgan Rielly took a shot that Dostal stopped but the puck rebounded off his chest. The goal allowed Toronto to extend its streak of not being shutout to 181 games, with the score coming on its 50th shot of the game. The run started in November 2021. “There is a lot of belief in this locker room with the type of players we have and the team game we play that eventually we’ll find a way to break through,” Tavares said. The Ducks were without forward Troy Terry, who was placed on injured reserve with an upper-body injury. Defenseman Radko Gudas (illness) was out and forward Ryan Strome (upper body) missed another game. Forward Isac Lundestrom (Achilles) was activated for the first time this season and saw 10:43 of ice time. UP NEXT Maple Leafs: At San Jose on Saturday.

"WASHINGTON — For more than two months,   considered hanging up his skates and retiring from the NHL.  in less than a year left him in bed after another surgery awaiting more rehab, unable to travel with his kids to their hockey tournaments or live a normal life. Then he came to the realization he wasn’t ready to give up on playing. WASHINGTON — For more than two months,   considered hanging up his skates and retiring from the NHL.  in less than a year left him in bed after another surgery awaiting more rehab, unable to travel with his kids to their hockey tournaments or live a normal life. Then he came to the realization he wasn’t ready to give up on playing. On Wednesday night, Pacioretty played his   when he and the Washington Capitals hosted the New Jersey Devils. “It’s important for me to do this for myself but also for my family and my kids to kind of show them that we can get through this together,” the 35-year-old veteran said recently. “I know I have so much more hockey in the tank.” That’s what the Capitals were banking on when they   last summer, fully understanding he wouldn’t be ready for at least the first quarter of the season, if not longer. The six-time 30-goal scorer jumps in 35 games in, with Washington among the lowest-scoring teams in the league. “We got to find a way to score more goals, and that’s what he does,” general manager Brian MacLellan said upon signing Pacioretty to an incentive-laden one-year contract. The Capitals did their due diligence, MacLellan said, with head trainer Jason Serbus and Dr. John Klimkiewicz talking to the surgeon who repaired Pacioretty’s tendon. There’s still some risk involved, but he and the team have taken things slowly after concerns he rushed back last January to play for Carolina. “Obviously, I had to do something different than the first time,” Pacioretty said. “We’re handling this entirely differently from the surgery to the rehab to the treatment to the progressions. ... It’s just an entirely different program.” The program involved Pacioretty resuming skating in early November and gradually ramping up to practicing with the team. The Connecticut native at the time said getting back on the ice gave him some welcome normalcy. “Definitely have much more of a smile on my face now,” he said. “I feel like I’m getting my life back.” Pacioretty is back with a different right skate boot than before because the surgically-repaired tendon is bigger now. But that hasn’t stopped him from feeling like his old self shooting the puck, something he’s done among the NHL’s best since making his debut for Montreal in 2008. Between then and the end of the 2021-22 season, only 16 players have scored more goals than Pacioretty in his time with the Canadiens and then the Vegas Golden Knights. “Everybody knows Max: He’s an elite player,” said Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin, who owns the top spot on that list. “We’re going to have another big weapon in our lineup.” It was a globetrotting journey back into a lineup for Pacioretty, who saw specialists from the U.S. and Canada to Germany and Finland. Now confident he has a grasp of what happened — and back before facing the Hurricanes on Friday — he just wants to stay healthy and get back into a groove. “This is what I was born to do,” Pacioretty said, “and I want to do this as long as I can.” ___ AP NHL: ","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMNIMYFKUMI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMNIMYFKUMI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMNIMYFKUMI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMNIMYFKUMI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMNIMYFKUMI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DMNIMYFKUMI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2024/01/03/max-pacioretty-achilles-capitals/e4d166fc-aa82-11ee-bc8c-7319480da4f9_story.html,Washington Post,2024-01-03 20:46:00,

McLeod got there, scored on a spinning backhanded shot and the New Jersey Devils regained the lead and never trailed again. They poured it on in the third period on the way to a 6-3 victory Wednesday night that showed a still young team’s ability to handle adversity. “There’s ups and downs in games, and I think sometimes we get too down,” said McLeod, who scored his second goal of the game in the third period to ice it. “Them tying it up and then us getting that goal and coming out in the third like we did, that’s what we want to see.” McLeod was one of three two-goal scorers for the Devils, joined by Nico Hischier and Dawson Mercer, who was playing his 200th consecutive game to begin his NHL career. Hischier also had an assist as the New Jersey captain put together a three-point performance on the eve of his 25th birthday. “He had a great game,” Mercer said of Hischier. “He plays the same way every night. He’s a great captain, and he really just showed that out there.” Nico Daws made 23 saves to pick up his second victory in two appearances since being called up last month, and the Devils won for the fourth time in five games. They did so without forwards Timo Meier and Ondrej Palat, the latter of whom was a surprise scratch with a lower-body injury. Coach Lindy Ruff said Palat was being evaluated and would likely be unavailable for the next few games after leaving practice Tuesday. Despite some significant absences mounting, New Jersey has found some consistency and passed Washington in the standings, moving into an Eastern Conference wild card spot. “Everyone’s got to step up to the plate,” Mercer said. “That’s the nature of the game. It’s a hard game out there, hard fought, and it’s good for us here to step up, play the part and help our team win out there.” Evgeny Kuznetsov had a goal and an assist, and Connor McMichael and John Carlson also scored for the Capitals. Kuznetsov ended a 10-game point and 11-game goal-scoring drought. Hunter Shepard allowed six goals on 26 shots in starting the second half of a back to back after Washington   on Tuesday night. Alex Ovechkin extended his point streak to three games with two assists, but the Capitals lost for a fifth time in six games. “Just too many mistakes and not enough push at the end,” coach Spencer Carbery said. “And you’ve got to give them credit. They’re a young, fast-skating team, so you see in that third period that really took over.” Veteran forward  , playing his first NHL game in nearly a year since  . “A lot of emotions, but at the end of the day, probably couldn’t get any worse than it did for me,” Pacioretty said. “Got to get better from it.” UP NEXT Devils: Host Chicago on Friday.

"House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) led a delegation of Republicans to the southern border Wednesday to re-center attention on the number of immigrants seeking to enter the United States and what Republicans argue is the failure of the Biden administration to address the issue.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) led a delegation of Republicans to the southern border Wednesday to re-center attention on the number of immigrants seeking to enter the United States and what Republicans argue is the failure of the Biden administration to address the issue. Johnson was interviewed by CNN’s Jake Tapper after the visit. The host   the speaker about White House   that Republicans are blocking funding that would increase the number of border agents and judges who can adjudicate asylum claims. Johnson insisted that the problem to be solved was curtailing immigration, not accommodating it. Then he offered an argument meant to demonstrate the putative threat posed by these immigrants. “Over 300 known terrorists apprehended at the border trying to come in,” Johnson claimed. “We don’t know how many evaded capture and detection. They’re in the country, potentially setting up terrorist cells everywhere.” Tapper soon responded to that claim. “There aren’t hundreds of known terrorists getting into the country,” he said. “There are people whose identity have been flagged on a certain database.” Johnson interjected, prompting Tapper to add: “I’m not saying that it’s not serious, I’m just saying these aren’t necessarily terrorists.” Tapper is correct, as we have   before. The watch list is not entirely constituted of demonstrated terrorists, much less foreign ones. But there’s an important other component of this argument, too: These are people who were  from entering the country. This is a vitally important point that is underrecognized — or, perhaps, explicitly ignored — by those seeking to use immigration against   and his administration. It’s like those social media posts in which Republicans wring their hands about the amount of illegal drugs seized at the border ( ): Those are drugs that have been taken out of circulation. Johnson is right that there may be terrorists who entered the country, as may have been the case in 2019 when   on the watch list were stopped. But we don’t know that any have. The distinction between border stops and new arrivals to the country becomes more important when considering such things as the increased acceptance of “great replacement”-adjacent rhetoric. Consider the musings of Elon Musk, the owner of X (formerly Twitter), who has pinned the following post to the top of his feed on the platform. Almost no one seems to be aware of the immense size and lightning growth of this issue.  According to the mayors, it is already overwhelming essential services in New York, Chicago and other cities.  This was the second time he has highlighted the same graph, which purports to show that more people are coming to the United States monthly than are born “to American mothers.” The graph itself is misleading. First, the number of encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border each month over the past several years has   exceeded 250,000, in December 2022 and November 2023. At   has the number of births in the United States (not all of which are to American mothers) been larger than the number of border encounters, though the gap has been more narrow. The “encounter” numbers, though, are an overstatement. If we look at   on who was encountered at the southwest border each month in the past few years, we see the rise under Biden. But many of those encounters led either to people being turned away at border checkpoints (deemed inadmissible) or to people being quickly removed from the country (expulsions). Of those who weren’t quickly turned away, many ended up in detention, either by federal or other law enforcement agencies. The increase in arrivals led to an increase in the number of immigrants granted “humanitarian release” — allowed to go free while judicial proceedings unfold — but it’s a far cry from the “7 million people [who] have come into the country since Biden walked into the Oval Office,” as Johnson told Tapper, which he claimed was a “low estimate.” The total is closer to 1.4 million. About 10.6 million babies have been born in the United States during that span. At the heart of the surge in migration is the big increase in the number of immigrants making asylum claims, hoping to stay in the country should an immigration judge decide that their circumstances warrant a grant of asylum. This increase has put an enormous strain on the process of adjudicating the claims, with hundreds of thousands of immigrants being released into the country to await hearings — a wait that could last years. This is the White House’s argument: With more funding, there can be more adjudications, and more immigrants ineligible for asylum can be removed from the United States more quickly. There are other factors, too,   the current strength of the economy. But it is not the case that immigration is up because Democrats want to  , much less the voter pool (since those immigrants cannot vote until they become citizens). It is, however, the case that the right sees   from the increase in immigration than the left. And the bigger the number the right can point to, the larger that benefit gets.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KF5GHE7SSDQHN36YQONYCGR3V4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KF5GHE7SSDQHN36YQONYCGR3V4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KF5GHE7SSDQHN36YQONYCGR3V4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KF5GHE7SSDQHN36YQONYCGR3V4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KF5GHE7SSDQHN36YQONYCGR3V4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KF5GHE7SSDQHN36YQONYCGR3V4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/04/immigration-republicans-speaker-johnson/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 17:18:00,

"NEW YORK — Artemi Panarin scored his team-best 24th goal, Vincent Trocheck added three assists and the New York Rangers defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 4-1 on Thursday night. Chris Kreider, Jacob Trouba and Jimmy Vesey also scored for the Rangers, who rebounded from Tuesday’s 6-1 home loss to Carolina and improved to 10-1-0 in games after a loss this season. Igor Shesterkin made 22 saves. NEW YORK — Artemi Panarin scored his team-best 24th goal, Vincent Trocheck added three assists and the New York Rangers defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 4-1 on Thursday night. Chris Kreider, Jacob Trouba and Jimmy Vesey also scored for the Rangers, who rebounded from Tuesday’s 6-1 home loss to Carolina and improved to 10-1-0 in games after a loss this season. Igor Shesterkin made 22 saves. Former Ranger Colin Blackwell scored for Chicago, which lost its fourth straight and for the sixth time in seven games. The Rangers have won six of their last seven meetings with the Blackhawks and New York improved to 12-3-1 against Western Conference opponents. “Any team in the NHL can beat any other team,’’ Trocheck said. ”You’ve got to be sure you don’t lapse. We always want to focus on defense and our best games are when we are solid defensively.” Shesterkin had a relatively easy night’s work against the last-place Blackhawks as he improved to 16-8-0 and won for the sixth time in seven games. Panarin opened the scoring, with a one-timer past Chicago goaltender Petr Mrazek at the 13-minute mark of the first period with assists to Alexis Lafreniere and Trocheck. Mrazek had 27 saves. Panarin, who played his first two NHL seasons for the Blackhawks, extended his points streak to six games and has points in 31 of the New York’s 37 games this season. He leads the Rangers with 53 points. “Good win,’’ Panarin said. “We’ll take that,″ Kreider made it 2-0 with a power-play goal at 7:23 of the second. The puck deflected off Kreider’s skate into the Blackhawks net but was ruled not to be a distinct kicking motion since Kreider’s skates didn’t leave the ice and therefore a goal, Kreider’s 20th of the season. Kreider has a career-best points streak of eight games and the Rangers have scored a power-play goal in 10 of their last 12 games. Kreider also reached the 20-goal mark for the ninth time. Only two players in Rangers history have recorded as many — Rod Gilbert with 12 seasons and Jean Ratelle, also with nine. Blackwell narrowed the deficit to 2-1 at 17:03 of the second with his first goal of the season. Trouba made it 3-1 with his third at 1:31 of the third period — with assists to Panarin and Trocheck — before Jimmy Vesey scored his eighth at 2:41. Trocheck is second on the Rangers with 27 assists. Panarin has 29. “There’s extra emphasis on games after a loss,” Trocheck said. “We try to make adjustments to what we were doing wrong.” When scoring four or more goals in a game, the Rangers are 16-0-1. His team’s dominant performance pleased Rangers coach Peter Laviolette. “I thought we did a good job,” he said. “I thought our game was a lot cleaner and more consistent than the other night.” Chicago rookie Connor Bedard, the top overall pick in last June’s draft, made his New York-area debut and was held off the scoresheet. The 18-year-old forward leads the Blackhawks with 15 goals and 33 points. “We worked hard but had tough luck around the net,’’ Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. ”At times we played well, but it wasn’t enough. They are a powerful team.” The contest also marked the NHL debut of Rangers forward Brennan Othmann, the 16th overall pick in 2021, who was recalled from AHL Hartford on Wednesday. He had nine goals and 23 points in 28 games this season for Hartford. Othmann skated on line with Nick Bonino and Jonny Brodzinski and had five shots in 12;26 of ice time. “It was exciting. I just wanted to have fun and enjoy the moment,’’ said Othmann whose parents, grandparents and sister were at Madison Square Garden. ”I was a little nervous the first couple of shifts ... I think the chances I created were positive, and that’s a good confidence builder going forward.” UP NEXT: Rangers: At Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night.

"A member of the far-right Proud Boys group got a 10-year prison term Thursday for participating in the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The defendant, Christopher Worrell, missed his first scheduled sentencing hearing, in August, after he fled home detention and vanished for weeks, according to authorities, who said he later purposely took a drug overdose to further delay the proceedings. A member of the far-right Proud Boys group got a 10-year prison term Thursday for participating in the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The defendant, Christopher Worrell, missed his first scheduled sentencing hearing, in August, after he fled home detention and vanished for weeks, according to authorities, who said he later purposely took a drug overdose to further delay the proceedings. Worrell, 52, of Naples, Fla., was   May 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington. The charges included assaulting three police officers with pepper-spray gel during the Capitol riot as mobs of supporters of President   sought to halt the formal counting of 2020 electoral votes by members of Congress. “According to the government’s evidence, Worrell plotted his trip to D.C. with other Proud Boys” weeks before Jan. 6, the U.S. attorney’s office in the District said in a statement after the sentencing. He took part in “conversations in which the police were called traitors and Proud Boys brainstormed ways to disrupt” the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the presidential election, the statement said. “Worrell arrived in the District ready for battle, wearing body armor, and carrying two cans of Sabre Red Maximum Strength Pepper Gel and a large radio to coordinate” with other rioters, the statement said. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth released Worrell from the D.C. jail in 2021 and placed him under house arrest in Florida after learning that Worrell had   at the jail for his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and a broken wrist. After his conviction, Worrell was allowed to remain on home detention while awaiting sentencing, initially set for August. Four days before the scheduled hearing, authorities said, Worrell cut off his GPS ankle monitor in a Walmart parking lot and fled. Assistant U.S. Attorney Will Dreher said Worrell’s disappearance triggered a six-week manhunt that ended when Worrell attempted to “covertly return to his house” in late September. When FBI agents entered the residence, Dreher said, they found Worrell “seemingly unresponsive” with “an opened bottle of opioid prescription medication in his hand.” He was hospitalized for five days. In a sentencing memo filed in court, prosecutors said a friend later asked Worrell in an email if he had been trying to commit suicide, and that Worrell replied: “It was a stupid delay tactic.” Worrell was found guilty of seven counts, including obstructing Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential electoral results, engaging in violence on Capitol grounds and assaulting the three officers. During his nonjury bench trial, Worrell argued that he helped police by pepper-spraying left-wing agitators of the riot. Lamberth, at the trial, rebuked the claim as “preposterous.” “He can’t say that he is a political prisoner and what he did was justified,” Lamberth said Thursday. “The court can’t send a message saying it was okay. It wasn’t okay.” Through muffled sobs, Worrell told the judge that his actions had been “inexcusable and unjustified.” He described the drug overdose as a delaying tactic to avoid humiliation. When he heard the FBI officials shout his name as they entered his home that September day, he said, the thought of returning to the D.C. jail caused him to swallow a bottle of pills. “You very likely saved my life sending me home,” Worrell said to Lamberth of his earlier placement under house arrest. “I sincerely meant no disrespect or embarrassment to the court. I suffered a severe mental breakdown.” Officials previously described Worrell and co-defendant Daniel Lyons Scott as  by the four leaders of the right-wing group who were  . Scott, who was sentenced in July to five years in prison, “bulldozed two officers” guarding a staircase leading up from the lower West Terrace, prosecutors said. Officials alleged that Scott’s assault helped clear the way for a mob led by fellow Proud Boys members to “open up the whole west side of the Capitol.” Worrell is seen moving with Scott in video footage. William Shipley, Worrell’s attorney, said Worrell acted recklessly by taking out the spray but did not intentionally harm police. He added that Worrell did not enter the Capitol building itself. Lamberth said the case was a “hard one” for him, knowing the defendant’s history with cancer. After imposing the sentence, he said, “I don’t want to see you die in prison.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PPHBXMBMOUI6ZML5TBOBQ3PDHA.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PPHBXMBMOUI6ZML5TBOBQ3PDHA.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PPHBXMBMOUI6ZML5TBOBQ3PDHA.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PPHBXMBMOUI6ZML5TBOBQ3PDHA.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PPHBXMBMOUI6ZML5TBOBQ3PDHA.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PPHBXMBMOUI6ZML5TBOBQ3PDHA.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/04/jan6-rioter-proud-boy-sentence/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 19:11:00,

PHILADELPHIA — Johnny Gaudreau scored in the shootout, Damon Severson and Jake Bean netted goals in the third period and the Columbus Blue Jackets came back to defeat the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 on Thursday night. Gaudreau, Columbus’ first shooter, beat Flyers goalie Samuel Ersson and Daniil Tarasov clinched the victory for the Blue Jackets with a glove save on Tyson Foerster. Neither Sean Couturier nor Bobby Brink could convert for Philadelphia. The win was just the second in the last seven contests for Columbus. “We didn’t win enough battles in the first two periods,” Blue Jackets coach Pascal Vincent said. “In the third period, we were better.” Travis Konecny, named to   on Thursday, scored both goals for Philadelphia. The Flyers dropped their fourth consecutive contest and sixth in the last seven. “Yeah, it’s gonna be great,” Konecny said of his second All-Star appearance. “Really excited. It’s an honor, and I couldn’t do it without my teammates.” Joel Farabee and Couturier each assisted both of Konecny’s tallies. Ersson made 26 saves for the Flyers, who returned home for the first time since Dec. 21 after losing four of five on the road. Tarasov stopped 39 shots for the Blue Jackets. “I thought he was outstanding tonight,” Vincent said. “Really good from start to finish.” Konecny netted his first of the night with 2:48 left in the first period. Farabee won a battle in the corner, got the puck back in the slot and fired toward Konecny at the side of the net. Philadelphia’s forward buried the chance. Konecny notched his second of the game 4:29 into the third period to put Philadelphia in front 2-0. Konecny deked past Columbus defenseman Bean and beat Tarasov to up his team-leading totals to 20 goals and 35 points. Severson pulled Columbus within a goal 55 seconds later when his slap shot from long range got past Ersson on the glove side. “We found a way in the third to get something going,” Severson said. Bean tied it with 9:40 left in regulation. “We gave up the first one too quickly,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said. “Prior to that, they had very few chances.” UP NEXT Blue Jackets: Host Minnesota on Saturday night.

"KYIV — Ukraine and Russia exchanged nearly 500 prisoners of war on Wednesday — including Ukrainian service members detained during fighting at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and on Snake Island in the Black Sea — one of the few areas of cooperation between the two sides. It was the largest such exchange since the Russian invasion nearly two years ago, Ukraine’s coordination headquarters for POW issues said in a post on Telegram. Officials from the United Arab Emirates helped mediate the process, Russian and Ukrainian officials said. KYIV — Ukraine and Russia exchanged nearly 500 prisoners of war on Wednesday — including Ukrainian service members detained during fighting at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and on Snake Island in the Black Sea — one of the few areas of cooperation between the two sides. It was the largest such exchange since the Russian invasion nearly two years ago, Ukraine’s coordination headquarters for POW issues said in a post on Telegram. Officials from the United Arab Emirates helped mediate the process, Russian and Ukrainian officials said. Ukrainian officials said that 230 of their service members returned home, while Russia said 248 of its POWs were released. Neither set of figures could be independently verified. “Over a significant period, we managed to conduct a very complex exchange,” said Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraine’s military intelligence and head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. Speaking in a video posted on social media, Budanov said the released Ukrainians included “a combat medic, defenders from Snake Island, Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Azovstal, border guards, police, national guard and armed forces — that is, absolutely all categories.” “This exchange has been prepared for a sufficiently long time,” he said. For its part, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Telegram that “all released Russian servicemen are being provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance.” However, Russian human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova said 75 of the Russian POWs were handed back “without an exchange,” the Russian RIA Novosti news agency reported — implying that the main trade involved 173 Russian service members. RIA quoted an unnamed “source” as saying that the 75 Russians were released in exchange for five Ukrainian commanders from the Azov Brigade who returned to Ukraine in July. The Azov members had been captured by Russian forces early in the war and reportedly were under house arrest under Turkey’s supervision. RIA said the commanders returned to Ukraine “in violation of all agreements.” On Wednesday, photos and videos posted on social media showed the Ukrainian POWs, many with Ukrainian flags draped across their shoulders, being greeted on their return and singing their national anthem. “Our [fighters] are home,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Telegram, announcing the news of the exchange. “We will do everything to return all our people who are currently in Russian captivity.” Petro Yatsenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s POW coordination headquarters, said seven Ukrainian service members who had been released were taken prisoner while fighting on Snake Island — the location of a strategic Ukrainian base in the Black Sea that Russian forces seized in the first days of the war. The garrison there gained international fame after its soldiers reportedly responded with an expletive to a Russian ship’s demand to surrender. Yatsenko also said that 12 of those who returned were taken prisoner at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works — a sprawling industrial complex in the southern city of Mariupol that became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Hundreds of Ukrainian fighters and civilians held out against a months-long Russian siege, eventually succumbing in May 2022.. The prisoner exchange brings some cheer to Ukraine’s east, where the two sides have settled into brutal  trench warfare and artillery battles, eking out only small territorial gains. Over the New Year’s holidays, Russian forces launched drone and missile strikes that killed dozens and injured hundreds across Ukraine, inflicting damage beyond the front lines in a vicious show of force. In a recent interview with the Economist, Zelensky said he didn’t see “any fundamental steps forward to the peace from Russia” that could lead to negotiations. Instead, he said, he saw “only the steps of a terrorist country.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JODWS2GNXCBSOMIXKQW2J4VZ3Y.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JODWS2GNXCBSOMIXKQW2J4VZ3Y.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JODWS2GNXCBSOMIXKQW2J4VZ3Y.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JODWS2GNXCBSOMIXKQW2J4VZ3Y.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JODWS2GNXCBSOMIXKQW2J4VZ3Y.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JODWS2GNXCBSOMIXKQW2J4VZ3Y.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/03/ukraine-russia-exchange-nearly-500-prisoners-war/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 17:08:00,
"DES MOINES —   and   held back-to-back CNN town halls in Iowa on Thursday as they fight to emerge as the primary GOP presidential challenger to polling leader  . With the Iowa caucuses set to kick off the Republican nominating process on Jan. 15, the town halls are among the candidates’ final chances to make an impression and upend a race that has been remarkably stagnant — with the former president consistently ahead of the pack. DES MOINES —   and   held back-to-back CNN town halls in Iowa on Thursday as they fight to emerge as the primary GOP presidential challenger to polling leader  . With the Iowa caucuses set to kick off the Republican nominating process on Jan. 15, the town halls are among the candidates’ final chances to make an impression and upend a race that has been remarkably stagnant — with the former president consistently ahead of the pack. DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and Haley, a former U.N. ambassador, are now fighting for second place in Iowa and are set to debate  . Trump has skipped debates throughout the primary, denying his lower-polling rivals the chance to attack him face-to-face. Here are the biggest takeaways. Haley was doing damage control Thursday for remarks she made at a New Hampshire event a week ago, when she omitted slavery as a cause of the Civil War and faced intense backlash. (She later said she should have acknowledged slavery’s central role.) “If you grow up in South Carolina, literally in second and third grade, you learn about slavery,” Haley said at the CNN town hall Thursday. “You grow up and you have, you know, I had Black friends growing up. It is a very talked-about thing. We have a big history in South Carolina, when it comes to, you know, slavery, when it comes to all the things that happened with the Civil War, all of that. “I was thinking past slavery, and talking about the lesson that we would learn going forward. I shouldn’t have done that,” she said. She pointed to her childhood growing up in the only Indian family in a small, rural, racially divided town, and she said racism was discussed more than slavery. “It was not just slavery that was talked about, it was more about racism that was talked about,” she said. “We had Black friends, we had White friends, but it was always a topic of conversation.” Haley continued on to elaborate on her “share of dealing with — with race issues” as governor, including the shooting of an unarmed Black man by a police officer and her role in bringing down the Confederate flag at the state Capitol following the murder of nine Black men and women at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston by a White man. The mention of “Black friends” drew some mockery online from DeSantis supporters. Yes, they took some jabs at each other. Haley noted that she polls better than DeSantis in hypothetical matchups with  . DeSantis started his segment with a gag alluding to Haley’s recent flub of an Iowa basketball star’s name, presenting CNN moderator Kaitlan Collins with a jersey onstage and saying, “I heard the other day someone say that Kaitlan Collins had some basketball skills.” (Campaigning at a tailgate in Iowa, Haley had referred to Collins rather than Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlin Clark.) But both DeSantis and Haley focused most of their attacks on Trump, the overwhelming polling leader — a departure from the overall dynamic of the race in Iowa, in which Trump’s rivals have largely been assailing each other in town halls and TV ads. DeSantis’s strategy has always hinged on peeling away Trump voters, even as he defends him on many fronts. He took sharp aim at Trump’s record — saying the former president didn’t stop an “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border and hadn’t dismantled “the bureaucracy.” Asked about his and other GOP candidates’ calling to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants born on U.S. soil — which would certainly face legal challenges — DeSantis made a point to note that Trump had campaigned on the idea and did not sign an executive order attempting to enact it. “Do you think Donald Trump is not pro-life?” Collins asked after DeSantis assailed Trump’s criticism of state-level six-week   bans. “Course not,” DeSantis replied. Haley, meanwhile, was asked how she planned to overtake Trump. She reiterated her usual criticism that “rightly or wrongly, chaos follows” him, and the moderator followed up: “Is it rightly or wrongly? Is he the one who causes that chaos or is he just the unwitting victim?” “It’s both,” Haley replied. She said some of the charges against him are “political,” but she also called Trump his “own worst enemy” and criticized his praise for certain dictators. “I think it’s completely wrong,” she said, going on to note Trump’s warm words for China’s Xi Jinping and his feuding with Israel’s prime minister. DeSantis had spent much of Thursday knocking Haley for her recent  — at an event in New Hampshire — that Iowans start the GOP nominating process and then Granite State voters “correct it.” It was an allusion to the fact that New Hampshire, which votes shortly after Iowa, often backs a different  . DeSantis boosters, including Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), pounced on the remarks, suggesting Haley had insulted residents of the first-in-the-nation GOP caucus state. And Haley was pressed on the episode Thursday evening. The audience groaned when the moderator for Haley’s segment, Erin Burnett, brought it up. “Oh my God,” Haley said. “I’m just looking around at people’s faces,” Burnett said a few beats later. Haley argued it was a lighthearted comment. “You gotta have some fun, too,” she said. “... Yes, I said that, but keep in mind, I’m from an early state, South Carolina. … We banter against each other. … New Hampshire makes fun of Iowa, Iowa makes fun of South Carolina, it’s what we do. I think the problem in politics now, it’s just too serious.” DeSantis was pressed on some topics he doesn’t normally bring up. With the third anniversary of the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol approaching, one voter asked DeSantis for his “definition of patriotism” and if the Jan. 6 “insurrectionists” displayed it, as some of them claimed. “No, of course not,” DeSantis said, adding “that was not a good day for the country.” But he also reiterated his frequent argument that Democrats and the media have overblown the events of that day, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and briefly halted the certification of the 2020 election, seeking to overturn the former president’s loss. Collins also brought up same-sex marriage, another thorny issue for Republicans. She noted that DeSantis has previously said marriage is between a man and a woman and asked if he still feels that way. “That’s just what marriage is with the church,” DeSantis said, “and I respect the Supreme Court’s decision, so we’ve abided by that in Florida.” The Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015. DeSantis went on to warn against people who “try to wield power against our religious institutions” and said he would protect them. Both candidates were asked about gun violence in the wake of a   that unfolded Thursday in Iowa, with one voter asking DeSantis how he would address the issue “without taking away any gun rights.” Collins pressed DeSantis on whether he supports an effort to eliminate a three-day waiting period to buy rifles and shotguns in Florida. DeSantis said he supported “instant” checks on buyers. “You don’t support the three-day waiting period?” Collins asked. “I think it should be instant,” DeSantis reiterated. Haley focused on mental health as a driver of such shootings. “Just to be clear on gun restrictions themselves — do you favor any additional gun restrictions or not?” she was asked. “We could go and take away a certain kind of gun today, and that would make you feel better today,” Haley said, “but a week from now, there’d be another shooting.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WRNDUK7ZVRDX4MDXZG44NHYVKA.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WRNDUK7ZVRDX4MDXZG44NHYVKA.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WRNDUK7ZVRDX4MDXZG44NHYVKA.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WRNDUK7ZVRDX4MDXZG44NHYVKA.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WRNDUK7ZVRDX4MDXZG44NHYVKA.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WRNDUK7ZVRDX4MDXZG44NHYVKA.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/desantis-haley-cnn-town-halls/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 00:45:00,
"BETTENDORF, Iowa — At a campaign event this week, Republican     touted an endorsement by a disgraced former congressman who lost his election after defending white nationalism. He refused to directly condemn white supremacy. And he said he didn’t recognize the name of Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who   at a historically Black church in South Carolina. BETTENDORF, Iowa — At a campaign event this week, Republican     touted an endorsement by a disgraced former congressman who lost his election after defending white nationalism. He refused to directly condemn white supremacy. And he said he didn’t recognize the name of Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who   at a historically Black church in South Carolina. “Was there a point in our prior national history where there have been vicious forms of anti-Black or anti-Brown discrimination in this country, after the Civil War and otherwise? Yes. But you’re looking in the rearview mirror,” said Ramaswamy, while making false incendiary claims that white supremacy was a fabricated threat as he stood in front of a banner that said “TRUTH.” An entrepreneur and first-time candidate who built some momentum last year but has since faded sharply in polls of the Republican race, Ramaswamy has increasingly embraced extreme ideas, far-right individuals and causes, and debunked conspiracy theories. Barnstorming this state in the final stretch before the Iowa caucuses, some Republican strategists see his approach as a desperate ploy to garner attention as a provocateur. It’s one that is also dangerous, some experts warned, as data shows white extremist violence and threats have risen in recent years. “While most people wouldn’t trust information coming from sources like Alex Jones or Steve King, they are more likely to trust a person like Ramaswamy who is running for the Republican Party nomination,” Jennifer Mercieca, a professor at Texas A&M University who researches democracy and rhetoric, wrote in an email. “This allows Ramaswamy to ‘launder’ narratives from the extreme rightwing fringe into the mainstream of American political discourse, which is how the extreme-right has taken over the Republican Party.” His comments on race, which have focused on casting liberals as racists and portraying White people as victims of racism, mark the latest instance of a Republican candidate using   that has drawn condemnations from civil rights leaders and scholars. Although Ramaswamy has long run a campaign promoting   such as raising the voting age to 25 unless certain requirements are met, as he has faded in the contest in recent months, his associations have grown more extreme. Ramaswamy has increasingly gained support from far-right figures, including participating in a live audio discussion on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, with internet personality and self-described misogynist Andrew Tate, who has been charged with rape and human trafficking, and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who   Ramaswamy “Alex Jones 2.0.” Jones has   that the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school mass killing was “staged” and was ordered to pay more than $1.1 billion after losing a series of lawsuits over his years of allegations that the massacre was a hoax. Ramaswamy has also used his platform as a presidential candidate to spread unfounded theories about the government. In a town hall hosted by CNN last month, he repeated without specific evidence that  , 2021, was an “inside job” and FBI agents triggered the crowd that stormed the U.S. Capitol  — a baseless claim that has been refuted by numerous court documents and bipartisan congressional investigations. Ramaswamy repeated similar conspiracy theories later on and said the kidnapping plot involving Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) was instigated by the government, pointing to three men who were  . However, nine of the 14 total defendants were convicted in the conspiracy. “He’s making a very clear strategic move by feeding these narratives, because it gives him a very distinct niche as the all-in-for-Trump, Tucker Carlson-adjacent candidate who isn’t scared to make outlandish or ‘biased’ statements,” said Rita Katz, executive director of  , which monitors online extremism. “This strategy will certainly play into the sentiments of Trump’s most hardcore MAGA followers, who are all the hungrier for conspiracist validation as lawsuits against Trump mount.” This positioning has come with little political reward in the primary for Ramaswamy, who is polling in fourth place in Iowa and fifth place in New Hampshire. The political newcomer surged to third place in polls after a breakout performance in the first GOP primary debate, but has tumbled down or stagnated since. Five percent of potential Republican caucusgoers said Ramaswamy was their first choice for president, far behind Trump (51 percent), DeSantis (19 percent) and Haley (16 percent), according to a Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom    . “He’s trying to be the next Alex Jones or Nick Fuentes,” said longtime Iowa GOP strategist Dave Kochel, adding the approach has not worked based on polling. Fuentes, a far-right political commentator, has a history of touting white nationalist ideas. Ramaswamy claims polls have not accurately reflected the extent of his base, and has sought to appeal to Trump’s larger base by arguing the “deep state” will not allow the former president back into the White House, therefore he should be elected to finish what Trump started. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. On Tuesday, Ramaswamy was asked about the new endorsement of former congressman Steve King and whether it might boost his campaign considering King  after questioning the negative connotation associated with white supremacy, a remark that had earned King    . Ramaswamy railed against a “mainstream media narrative” and argued King had said nothing racist. Asked by a Washington Post reporter if he himself condemned white supremacy, Ramaswamy said he was “not going to recite some catechism.” “Of course, I condemn any form of vicious racial discrimination in this country, but I think the presumption of your question is fundamentally based on a falsehood that this is really the main form of racial discrimination we see in this country today,” Ramaswamy said, adding that he believes “institutionalized racial discrimination” seen in America today is “based on affirmative action.” The reply earned cheers from the small crowd of supporters and campaign staff beside him; it also brought about more questions about Ramaswamy’s position on race as   from civil rights leaders and scholars over recent provocative stances on issues involving race. Ramaswamy went on to say the only example of the “myth of white supremacy” is actor Jussie Smollett, a Black and gay actor who was   of staging a racist, homophobic attack against himself in 2019. “Stop picking on this farce of some figment of something that exists at an infinitesimally small fringe of the American public today and open your eyes to the actual real threats that we face,” Ramaswamy said. When another reporter asked how he could cite Smollett as an example of white supremacy given the existence of Roof, who was   for a federal hate crime for killing nine Black parishioners in 2015, Ramaswamy said, “I don’t know who that is.” After Tuesday’s comments, he shared the video of his interactions with reporters on X. He called the question if he condemned white supremacy the “stupidest” question he had been asked on the campaign trail. This was not the first time Ramaswamy has cast doubt on the existence of white supremacy in America. In August, he compared Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who is Black, to a grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and said he didn’t believe white supremacists existed. The next day,  , Fla., using   inscribed with Nazi insignia, authorities said. “I’m sure the boogeyman white supremacists exist somewhere in America,” Ramaswamy said during a campaign stop in Iowa a day before the shooting. “I have just never met him. Never seen one. Never met one in my life, right? Maybe I will meet a unicorn sooner. And maybe those exist, too.” Last year, the FBI   that extremism “driven by a belief in the superiority of the white race” remained among the agency’s highest priority threats. Oren Segal, the vice president of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, also pointed to data collected by the civil rights group that has shown a significant uptick in white supremacist propaganda; the ADL tracked a   in 2022 in what it classified as “white supremacist propaganda” incidents from the previous year. “The evidence and the data showing the threat of white supremacist violence in particular is easy to find and it’s downplayed not on extremist fringes only but in our public discussion,” Segal said. “The rejection of some of the most horrific mass casualty attacks don’t fit some people’s political narrative.” Ramaswamy’s streak of incendiary comments has earned him less attention compared to his higher polling rivals, and some Republican voters attending other candidates’ events have questioned Ramaswamy’s comments and lack of political experience. “He’s a good young man,” New Hampshire voter Kenneth Strong said at a town hall for U.N. ambassador  . “But he’s not experienced, especially in foreign relations,” added Strong, who said he was considering voting for Trump or Haley. However, voters at Ramaswamy’s town hall said they would remain open to supporting Ramaswamy. Iowa resident Gwen Tombergs, an independent attending the event, said she’s considering backing Ramaswamy because she likes his business experience, but she disagreed with some of Ramaswamy’s remarks. When she saw King endorsed him, she searched King’s name because she didn’t know who he was — but she said she didn’t agree with supporting white nationalism. After hearing Ramaswamy’s comments about white supremacy, Tombergs, who is White, said she thinks he might have meant that he hasn’t experienced extremism, and neither has she; still, she said she would look closer at what he said and hasn’t ruled out supporting another candidate. “You can’t say nationalism,” she said. “I don’t care if it’s white, black or purple. It just doesn’t sound like it’s a real positive thing.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJLDHOY5B6KOJX4EXE3Z2JFOUA_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJLDHOY5B6KOJX4EXE3Z2JFOUA_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJLDHOY5B6KOJX4EXE3Z2JFOUA_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJLDHOY5B6KOJX4EXE3Z2JFOUA_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJLDHOY5B6KOJX4EXE3Z2JFOUA_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJLDHOY5B6KOJX4EXE3Z2JFOUA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/vivek-ramaswamy-conspiracy-theories-iowa/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 05:00:00,
"BOSTON — Sidney Crosby scored on the power play to snap a third-period tie and added two assists, lifting the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 6-5 win over the Boston Bruins on Thursday night. Crosby’s goal at 11:19 broke a 5-all deadlock and halted a four-game winning streak for the first-place Bruins, who rallied from three down to tie it. The Penguins also got goals from Drew O’Connor, Ryan Graves, Jake Guentzel, Lars Eller and Jeff Carter. Alex Nedeljkovic made 24 saves. BOSTON — Sidney Crosby scored on the power play to snap a third-period tie and added two assists, lifting the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 6-5 win over the Boston Bruins on Thursday night. Crosby’s goal at 11:19 broke a 5-all deadlock and halted a four-game winning streak for the first-place Bruins, who rallied from three down to tie it. The Penguins also got goals from Drew O’Connor, Ryan Graves, Jake Guentzel, Lars Eller and Jeff Carter. Alex Nedeljkovic made 24 saves. “We were probably a little hesitant and allowing them to come at us, but I thought we did a good job staying on our toes for the most part. That’s what got us the lead in the first place,” Crosby said after Pittsburgh won for the fourth time in five games. Brad Marchand scored twice for the Bruins, and David Pastrnak and Morgan Geekie both finished with a goal and two assists. Jeremy Swayman stopped 29 shots. “We were getting plenty of offense. We didn’t have to force it. Unfortunately, our game management cost us the game,” Boston coach Jim Montgomery said. “We believed we would come back to win. You want to have that spirit, but we need more players to rise up to the occasion.” The game started with a back-and-forth flourish as the teams combined for five goals in the first eight minutes. Boston opened the scoring 41 seconds in as Marchand won a 1-on-1 battle in front of Nedeljkovic after Pastrnak fired a wrist shot. The Penguins got the next two goals from O’Connor and Graves before Pastrnak collected his second point of the period on his 23rd goal of the season. Guentzel capped the wild start by putting Pittsburgh back in front. The forward converted a long pass from Kris Letang, with Crosby credited for his second assist of the first period. “Weird start, but some games happen like that. You’ve got to be able to handle it,” Crosby said. “The momentum swung a couple of times. It was one of those games where the last goal is going to win and we got the last one.” After eight scoreless minutes, the Penguins grabbed a two-goal advantage at 15:58 when Eller sizzled one past Swayman from a tough angle. Despite allowing four goals on 16 shots in the first, Swayman was back in net at the onset of the second period. He allowed another point-blank rebound goal to Carter that increased Pittsburgh’s lead to three at 6:38. Boston got one back as Pastrnak’s 30th assist of the season saw him zip a pass to Geekie, who waited for the lane to open up before beating Nedeljkovic. “We definitely had our chances. Couple of bad bounces, but that’s the way it goes sometimes,” Geekie said after Pittsburgh outshot Boston 35-29. From the high slot, Jake DeBrusk added to the scoring spree and trimmed Boston’s deficit to a single goal entering the final period. Marchand’s second goal was Boston’s first short-handed this season as he fired one past the blocker to tie the game at 5 early in the third. “There was some good and some bad. I liked our intensity and the way we battled back,” Marchand said. “Obviously, there are some plays we need to clean up and be better at.” Before the game, the NHL announced that Crosby and Pastrnak will represent their Eastern Conference teams at next month’s All-Star Game in Toronto. It’s the 10th career honor of Crosby’s brilliant career, while Pastrnak earned his fourth selection. UP NEXT Penguins: Host the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Connor Zary, Blake Coleman, Rasmus Andersson and Yegor Sharangovich each had a goal and an assist in the Calgary Flames’ 6-3 victory over the Nashville Predators on Thursday night. Nazem Kadri and Noah Hanifin also scored and Dan Vladar made 30 saves in the Flames’ third straight victory. “We want to gain a little bit of traction with stringing points together,” Flames coach Ryan Huska said. “It becomes important. That next game now becomes the most important game of the year for us.” Filip Forsberg, Colton Sissons and Michael McCarron scored and Juuse Saros made 21 saves for Nashville. The Predators had won two in a row. “A lot of sloppy hockey, a lot of slow-twitch thinking and playing, and not ready to start,” Nashville coach Andrew Brunette said. “I don’t think we did anything very well.” The teams combined for six goals in a wild opening period. Calgary struck first, with Zary and Coleman scoring 27 seconds apart at 4:45 and 5:12. “We came out pretty hard and we kind of took control of the game,” Zary said. “We got the lead and we were able to play with the lead. That’s something we want to do more of.” Zary’s goal came on the power play. Calgary entered Thursday with the NHL’s 30th-ranked power play, clicking at just 12%. Forsberg halved the Flames’ lead at 6:09 with his team-leading 19th goal. Just prior to the game, Forsberg was named an All Star for the second time in his career. “It was definitely not good enough and I think we got what we deserved,” Forsberg said. Sissons’ goal with 4:10 remaining in the first was his 12th of the season, equaling his total from last season. He scored a career-high 15 goals in 2018-19. Andersson scored with 1:16 remaining in the first with the teams skating 4-on-4 to send the Flames to the intermission up 4-2. Entering Thursday, Calgary’s opponents had outscored them 42-29 in the first period. “We knew it was a matter of time we’d start scoring first,” Coleman said. “It’s a lot easier to win on the road if you can get up early.” After posting a shutout Tuesday night against Chicago, Saros struggled early, allowing four goals on 11 shots against in the first period. Hanifin got the only goal of the middle frame on a tap in with 1.6 seconds remaining. Saros stopped 14 of 15 shots faced in the second. He was replaced by Kevin Lankinen to start the third. Lankinen made 13 saves in relief. McCarron scored a long-range goal at 2:15 of the third when his attempted dump-in went off Vladar’s blocker and into the net.

We have a big history in South Carolina, when it comes to, you know, slavery, when it comes to all the things that happened with the Civil War, all of that,” Haley said at a CNN town hall here. “I was thinking past slavery, and talking about the lesson that we would learn going forward. I shouldn’t have done that. I should have said slavery but in, in my mind, that’s a given that everybody associates the civil war with slavery,” she continued. She pointed to her childhood growing up in the only Indian family in a small, rural, racially divided town, and said that racism was discussed more than slavery. “It was not just slavery that was talked about, it was more about racism that was talked about,” she said. “We had Black friends, we had White friends, but it was always a topic of conversation.” Haley continued to elaborate on her “share of dealing with race issues” as governor in 2015, including the shooting of an unarmed Black man by a police officer and her role in   at the state capitol following the murder of nine Black men and women at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston by a White man. Her response Wednesday and defense that she had Black friends as a child was quickly mocked online by supporters of Florida Gov.  , who took the stage before Haley for his own CNN town hall. Other Republican lawmakers have   for similarly pointing out that  they have Black friends in their defense when accused of racism. Haley “hasn’t learned the critical issue of cleaning things up, which is sometimes less is more,” Republican strategist Scott Jennings said in a post-town hall panel on CNN. “It unspools and it unspools … less is more here, take the L and move on.” Former Trump White House communications director Alyssa Farah Griffin added that “she did herself no favors, and she kind of put herself back where she was at the beginning of this issue.” Across the aisle, Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison   on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that “as a Black Person in SC you can’t escape slavery, Jim Crow and their legacy,” in response to Haley’s answer, claiming her response “was rooted in political appeasement and not grounded in moral truth & clarity.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOWJBGPCCYORK5SEH7KFWB3OWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOWJBGPCCYORK5SEH7KFWB3OWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOWJBGPCCYORK5SEH7KFWB3OWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOWJBGPCCYORK5SEH7KFWB3OWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOWJBGPCCYORK5SEH7KFWB3OWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MOWJBGPCCYORK5SEH7KFWB3OWA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/nikki-haley-black-friends-civil-war-question/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 05:56:00,

Vasilevskiy’s bid for his 34th career shutout lasted until there was 4:25 left, when Zach Bogosian snapped a shot past him.  made 26 saves for the Wild, missing for the third straight game the chance to match Patrick Roy for second place on the   victory list with 551. Nikita Kucherov was limited to two shots and one assist for the Lightning on the night he was named to his fifth All-Star Game, ending his four-game goal streak. The Russian right wing has 10 goals and 10 assists in his last 12 games. Raddysh brought the Lightning to life soon after the first intermission when he redirected Luke Glendening’s shot from the point and backhanded his own rebound just out of Fleury’s reach as former Lightning forward Pat Maroon was a split-second late with his clearing attempt. Then Raddysh, a 27-year-old defenseman who had one goal in his first 60 regular-season NHL games,   less than 2 1/2 minutes later after going unchecked behind the net. The Lightning had only nine goals from the blue line this season before getting three in this game. “They just haven’t gone in. So to have three from the back end it, just gives us a little boost going forward,” said Raddysh, who scored once in the playoffs last spring. The Wild might as well have hosted this game in Iowa, where their AHL affiliate plays, given how many minor-leaguers they needed to fill out their lineup with their recent rash of injuries. Goalie Filip Gustavsson, defensemen Jonas Brodin and Jared Spurgeon, and forwards Marcus Foligno, Kirill Kaprizov, Vinni Lettieri and Mats Zuccarello were all unavailable. Just a week ago, only Brodin and Zuccarello were sidelined from the group that includes two first-line wings, the most experienced pair of blue-liners and their primary netminder. Oh, and all three of their captains. “Our execution tonight didn’t allow us to play fast,” Wild coach John Hynes said. “It was more the second pass out of the zone. We had a lot of pucks in skates, missed passes, bobbled pucks.” The Wild fell to 3-15-1 when their opponent scores first. “I thought we worked and tried to do the right things,” Bogosian said. “We’ve just got to stay connected.” UP NEXT Lightning: At Boston on Saturday night.

"Peter Magubane, a South African photojournalist who documented apartheid’s unrest and repression and was also caught in its grip, once jailed in solitary confinement for 586 days and banned from work for five years by the White-rule regime, died Jan. 1 at 91. The death was announced by his daughter, Fikile Magubane. No other details were given. Mr. Magubane had been treated for prostate cancer. Peter Magubane, a South African photojournalist who documented apartheid’s unrest and repression and was also caught in its grip, once jailed in solitary confinement for 586 days and banned from work for five years by the White-rule regime, died Jan. 1 at 91. The death was announced by his daughter, Fikile Magubane. No other details were given. Mr. Magubane had been treated for prostate cancer. As a Black photographer, Mr. Magubane often faced far greater risks than White colleagues but sometimes devised ingenious workarounds in places where authorities banned the media — including hiding his camera in a hollowed-out Bible and, another time, in a . When he nibbled too much of the bread away, he stashed his Leica 3G in an empty carton of milk. “You had to think very fast,” he told Mother Jones. “You had to be one up on apartheid.” His Zulu roots, however, also gave him some advantages in coverage. Mr. Magubane (pronounced mah-goo-BAHN-eh) could move through Black townships and other areas without drawing much attention. During riots in Soweto in 1976, protesters were worried that police would identify them through news photos. Mr. Magubane persuaded them to allow him and other photojournalists to do their jobs. “I said to them, ‘A struggle without documentation is no struggle,’” Mr. Magubane   in 2001. His   offered one of the most comprehensive archives of South Africa from the 1950s through the end of apartheid and the 1994 election of   as the country’s first Black president. Much of Mr. Magubane’s coverage — first working with South African media and later with international outlets including Time — chronicled some of the worse bloodshed of the apartheid era. At the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, after police killed at least 69 unarmed demonstrators, Mr. Magubane photographed a group of police with their backs turned to the camera, apparently indifferent to the body of a Black man behind them. During riots in Alexandra Township in 1976, a cadre of rock-throwing protesters fill the frame. In the center, one young man holds a trash can lid as a shield. “It is only after I complete my assignment that I think of the dangers that surrounded me, the tragedies that befell my people,” he once said. “I was demonstrating with my camera. I had to use it to show the South African people and the world what was going on in our country.” That also meant to Mr. Magubane showing the daily indignities of apartheid. At a mine, he photographed a line of  , stripped naked, standing in a line during a health inspection. In 1956, he saw a Black woman, presumably a domestic worker, with a young girl. The girl was on the side of the bench labeled “Europeans only.” The woman was on the other side, “Coloureds only.” The   gained worldwide attention and became one of Mr. Magubane’s best-known images. He never knew their names. “When I saw ‘Europeans Only,’ I knew I would have to approach with caution,” Mr. Magubane   the Guardian in 2015. “But I didn’t have a long lens, so I had to get close. I did not interact with the woman or the child, though. I never ask for permission when taking photos.” In 1969, he was assigned by the Rand Daily Mail newspaper to cover a demonstration outside the Pretoria jail holding Mandela’s wife, , and 21 other anti-apartheid activists. Mr. Magubane was arrested on security-related charges and spent 586 consecutive days in solitary. “The only person you saw was the guard, who would say: ‘Don’t talk to me,’” he  . He was released without any formal prosecution but was put under a “banning” order that effectively blocked him from working and limited his public interactions to only one other person. He was rearrested in March 1971 for allegedly violating the banning rules and spent more than six months in prison, including another stint in solitary of 98 days. “A bird would come and sit on the windowsill. When I stood up, it would fly away,” he said in the Guardian interview. “All I could think about was how much I wanted to be that bird.” When the banning order expired in 1975, he returned to work at  . “It was like being back from the dead,” he recalled. “But it was uphill, because I had lost my photographer’s eye.” By 1976, he was back to form and covered the Soweto uprising with “a vengeance,” he said. And again, the authorities came for him. Mr. Magubane and other Black journalists were detained for nearly five months in apparent retribution for the Soweto coverage. While in prison, Mr. Magubane’s house burned down. No suspects were charged. He never considered leaving the country. The battle against apartheid, he explained, needed to be told by the people who had the most at stake. “I was going to stay and fight with my camera as my gun,” he . “I did not want to kill anyone, though. I wanted to kill apartheid.” Peter Sexford Magubane was born in Vrededorp, a suburb of Johannesburg, on Jan. 18, 1932, and raised in nearby  , an area that was later razed and rebuilt as a Whites-only enclave. His father operated a vegetable cart, Mr. Magubane wrote in an essay. His mother was a homemaker. His interest in photography started with a Kodak Box Brownie, a gift from his father. There were few options, however, to learn the craft as a profession. Apartheid rules forbade Black photographers from using the same darkrooms as White colleagues. Mr. Magubane took a job as a tea boy at the magazine Drum, one of the rare media outlets that hired Black staff. Mr. Magubane eventually became a driver and studied photojournalists in action. After work, he took his own photos around Johannesburg and used the Drum darkroom. He had to sleep at the office because public transportation back to Sophiatown was closed for the night. Drum gave him his first real assignment, covering a convention of the anti-apartheid African National Congress in 1955. The ANC was soon banned by South Africa, and Mandela was jailed in 1962 and sentenced to life in prison in 1964. Mr. Magubane endured police beatings while on assignments. Once, he said, he returned to the office so bloodied and bandaged that his editor didn’t recognize him. Mr. Magubane moved to the Rand Daily Mail in 1967; he became a freelance photographer for Time magazine in 1978 and later for groups including the United Nations. He published 17  , with his most recent focusing on African culture and landscapes. “I’m tired of dealing with dead people,” he   the New York Times in 2012. “I now deal with sunsets.” His first two marriages ended in divorce. He married Lenora Taitt, an American civil rights activist, in the early 1980s. In 1992, the body of his son  , also a photographer, was found in Soweto. No suspects were charged. The body was found near a hostel used by members of the Inkatha Freedom Party, a Zulu faction and ANC rival led by  . Survivors include Mr. Magubane’s wife and daughter, Fikile Magubane. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. Two days after Mandela was released from prison in 1990, he and Mr. Magubane shared a dinner of chicken curry at Mandela’s home. Mr. Magubane accepted an offer to become Mandela’s official photographer, a position he held until the presidential election of 1994. Fresh from prison, Mandela realized he did not have a passport and might need to travel to the ANC headquarters in Zambia. Mr. Magubane made some headshots of Mandela, the first solo portraits of Mandela since his release from prison. The next morning, Mandela’s lawyer took the photos to the passport office in Johannesburg.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYUZLGGGXXIMWTJXT57GRZXITI_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYUZLGGGXXIMWTJXT57GRZXITI_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYUZLGGGXXIMWTJXT57GRZXITI_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYUZLGGGXXIMWTJXT57GRZXITI_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYUZLGGGXXIMWTJXT57GRZXITI_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XYUZLGGGXXIMWTJXT57GRZXITI_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/obituaries/2024/01/03/robert-magubane-photographer-apartheid-dies/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 21:05:00,

Can the NFL fire him?  , more than 500 Panthers fans had signed a petition advocating for Tepper to be removed as the owner because of his behavior.

We’re going to self-reflect and make it better.” Tepper fired Reich   as the Panthers   after using the No. 1 selection   on quarterback Bryce Young. This was the second straight season in which Tepper made an in-season coaching change. He fired Matt Rhule  . He is about to hire the fourth full-time head coach of his ownership tenure following Ron Rivera, Rhule and Reich. The Panthers also have had three interim head coaches during Tepper’s ownership. “My reputation away from this game is one for extreme patience,” Tepper said in November. “There’s no reason why that doesn’t come here, too. It does. Now, that patience comes with good performance. ... I would like to have somebody here for 20, 30 years.” The NFL sent a video to all teams Tuesday in which it said it is a player’s responsibility to ensure the referee understands when he is reporting as an eligible receiver for a play. The league distributed the video three days after a controversy involving an offensive lineman reporting as an eligible receiver   of the Detroit Lions’ loss Saturday night to the Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, Tex. NFL in video: ""It is the responsibility of the player to be sure that change in status is clearly communicated to the referee, by both a physical signal with his hands up and down in front of his chest and to report to the referee his intention to report as an eligible receiver.""  “It is the responsibility of the player to be sure that change in status is clearly communicated to the referee, by both a physical signal with his hands up and down in front of his chest and to report to the referee his intention to report as an eligible receiver,” the NFL said in the video, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post. The Lions lost, 20-19, after failing on three two-point conversion attempts following a touchdown in the closing seconds. Coach Dan Campbell opted to go for the victory in regulation rather than kicking an extra point that probably would have sent the game to overtime. The first of those two-point conversion tries appeared to succeed on a gadget-play pass from quarterback Jared Goff to offensive lineman Taylor Decker. But the officials disallowed the conversion and penalized Decker for illegal touching of a forward pass, saying he had not reported to referee Brad Allen as an eligible receiver. Video showed three Lions linemen, including Decker and Dan Skipper, approaching Allen before the play. Allen told a pool reporter after the game that Skipper had reported as an eligible receiver but Decker had not. The Lions said Decker reported as an eligible receiver but Skipper did not.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYHYTI7YL7YVWIMWJBIBCSTYUE_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYHYTI7YL7YVWIMWJBIBCSTYUE_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYHYTI7YL7YVWIMWJBIBCSTYUE_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYHYTI7YL7YVWIMWJBIBCSTYUE_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYHYTI7YL7YVWIMWJBIBCSTYUE_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WYHYTI7YL7YVWIMWJBIBCSTYUE_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/02/david-tepper-fined-panthers-owner-jaguars-fans/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 20:15:00,

Addressing the   on whether Donald Trump can be disqualified from state ballots for engaging in insurrection, Habba decided it would be a good time to remind people of just how much Trump has done for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. “I think it should be a slam dunk in the Supreme Court; I have faith in them,” Habba said on Fox News. “You know, people like Kavanaugh who the president fought for, who the president went through hell to get into place, he’ll step up.” Habba quickly added the disclaimer that the justices “will step up not because they’re pro-Trump, but because they’re pro-law, because they’re pro-fairness.” And she has since done  , trying to assure audiences that she wasn’t suggesting that Kavanaugh owed Trump loyalty. Habba: I think it should be a slam dunk in the supreme court. I have faith in them. You know, people like Kavanaugh, who the president fought for, who the president went through hell to get into place. He'll step up.  Two points. One is that, despite Habba’s cleanup effort, she was clearly pointing in the direction of Kavanaugh (and potentially others) being beholden to Trump; there is no other reason to invoke the supposed favors Trump did for Kavanaugh. This adds to a volume of evidence that indicates that Trump does indeed expect loyalty from judges and justices — along with plenty of others in positions where that shouldn’t be a consideration. The second point is that this is potentially counterproductive. Trump’s record on such issues is unambiguous. He has made clear he expects judges to toe his line, and he looks for loyalty in   — from officials who are supposed to be insulated from politics. That starts with but is hardly limited to an FBI director whose investigation threatened Trump, James B. Comey. “ ,” Comey testified that Trump told him in 2017 before Trump fired him. The Washington Post has reported that, also in 2017, Trump considered pulling the nomination of now-Justice Neil M. Gorsuch because of a perceived lack of loyalty. Gorsuch had in a confirmation interview with a Democratic senator expressed displeasure with Trump’s attacks on judges, calling them “disheartening” and “demoralizing.” As The Post’s Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Robert Barnes  : During his 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly suggested that judges he nominated would rule in predictable ways, including on issues such as  . “ ,” he assured evangelicals at one point. Trump in 2022 also bristled after the Supreme Court declined to help him shield his tax returns from the House Ways and Means Committee. “Many Republican Judges go out of their way to show they are beyond reproach, & will come down hard on people before them in order to prove they cannot be ‘bought’ or in any way show favor to those who appointed them,” Trump  , adding: “As soon as they get appointed, they go ‘ROGUE!’ ” Trump suggested that this was a contrast to judges appointed by Democrats, who were more apt to toe the party’s line. But that last point also shows how Habba’s comment could be ill-advised, even beyond the ethics of it. Whatever you think of Trump’s expressed sentiment about relative party loyalty, it’s true that judges are fiercely protective of the perception that they are independent. Yes, judges and even Supreme Court justices often rule in predictable ways that align with the party that appointed them. But crucial to the legitimacy of the court is the idea that they aren’t just political operatives doing the bidding of their allies. Habba’s comments — and Trump’s past comments — basically set the narrative that Trump is working the justices. And any favorable decision for Trump could be viewed as bowing to that pressure. Whether it affects Kavanaugh’s thought process or not, it puts him in a box. While the conventional wisdom is that the court would side with Trump in the 14th Amendment case,  . Trump is reportedly  . And the Supreme Court has  . Kavanaugh in his 2018 confirmation hearings was asked about this very subject. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) cited Trump’s demand for loyalty from Comey, and he asked Kavanaugh to address the “credible suspicion” that Trump might have chosen Kavanaugh believing the justice would protect him. Kavanaugh responded that “ , and I’ve made that clear and I’m an independent judge.” Trump has since expressed displeasure with Kavanaugh when Kavanaugh has demonstrated a measure of independence in some key cases. Trump said in an interview for a 2021 book that Kavanaugh “hasn’t had the courage you need to be a great justice.” Trump added: “  He wouldn’t even be in a law firm. Who would have had him? Nobody. Totally disgraced. Only I saved him.” It seems like no accident that Trump’s lawyer has now invoked basically the same argument, while attaching it to a crucial looming decision. Whether it’s smart to keep barking up that tree is another matter.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EMLNA5ZGYIYZBCKY7TVAFIKU4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EMLNA5ZGYIYZBCKY7TVAFIKU4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EMLNA5ZGYIYZBCKY7TVAFIKU4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EMLNA5ZGYIYZBCKY7TVAFIKU4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EMLNA5ZGYIYZBCKY7TVAFIKU4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EMLNA5ZGYIYZBCKY7TVAFIKU4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/2-key-points-trumps-lawyer-suggesting-justice-kavanaugh-owes-trump/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 11:55:00,
"When   did not back a national   ban, the leader of one of the country’s largest antiabortion groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, blasted his position as “morally indefensible.” The president of another leading antiabortion organization, Students for Life, took a stand months later after Trump called strict state bans “terrible” — deploying volunteers to a Trump rally in Miami with signs that read, “Make Trump Pro-Life Again.” When   did not back a national   ban, the leader of one of the country’s largest antiabortion groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, blasted his position as “morally indefensible.” The president of another leading antiabortion organization, Students for Life, took a stand months later after Trump called strict state bans “terrible” — deploying volunteers to a Trump rally in Miami with signs that read, “Make Trump Pro-Life Again.” That was last year. Now, with voting set to begin in a Republican presidential race that many expect will soon coronate Trump as the presumptive nominee, those two prominent activists and other leading antiabortion figures have largely put their criticisms aside — focusing instead on what a second Trump presidency could mean for the antiabortion movement. “Is he the most pro-life person? No,” Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life, said in a recent interview. “But he keeps his deals.” Marjorie Dannenfelser of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who had issued the searing critique of Trump’s abortion ban skepticism last spring, told The Washington Post in recent days that Trump has “built an enormous amount of trust with pro-life voters, as his presidency was the most consequential in American history for the pro-life cause.” Many antiabortion activists spent much of last year frustrated that the former president, who appointed the three conservative justices who brought down  , seemed to be tempering his support for their cause as he plotted his White House comeback amid a wave of support for abortion rights at the polls. They watched anxiously as Trump refused to endorse any kind of national abortion ban, privately telling those close to him that the “a-word,” as he called abortion, was a political loser. But in recent interviews and statements, leading antiabortion advocates are looking past what they characterize as purely political rhetoric — and plotting actions that they believe a Trump administration would take as early as next year to crack down on abortion. Leading advocates are concentrating on refining recommendations for two agencies with enormous power over abortion-related policies nationwide — the Justice and Health and Human Services departments — such as revisiting the 2000 approval of a key abortion drug and halting the mailing of abortion pills,   published by the conservative Heritage Foundation. The Food and Drug Administration, which approves drugs and has the power to take them off the market, operates under HHS. Roger Severino, who led several antiabortion efforts at HHS under Trump, said the movement is more focused on potential agency actions than passing a national abortion ban, which leaders privately acknowledge is extremely unlikely to make it through a divided Congress. For those reasons, the conversation over when in pregnancy to ban abortion nationally is “almost beside the point,” Severino said, emphasizing that he does not speak for Trump or any Republican campaign. “I don’t see his previous statements as limiting [Trump’s] ability to be a strong pro-life president.” Trump’s approach on abortion reflects what advisers say is his understanding of the need for political balance as he seeks to retain enthusiasm on the right ahead of the primaries but keep his eye on a more moderate November electorate. He aired an ad ahead of this month’s Iowa caucuses aimed at conservatives declaring that he “delivered” on abortion and lived “up to his promise” in helping to overturn  , while he has avoided rhetoric on abortion bans that could turn off the many GOP and independent voters who have sided with abortion rights in multiple state-level elections. Trump’s campaign has assured some conservative leaders in private meetings that the former president only criticized strict state abortion laws as a means of attacking Florida Gov.  , one of his opponents in the Republican primary who signed a six-week ban, according to a Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. DeSantis, asked during a CNN town hall Thursday night if Trump was “not pro-life,” pointed to his criticisms of state bans and responded flatly, “of course not.” He accused Trump of shifting his position, adding, “How do you flip-flop on something like the sanctity of life?” In a written statement, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not address the former president’s recent public and private comments on the abortion issue, pointing instead to his record in the White House. “He appointed strong Constitutionalist federal judges and Supreme Court justices who overturned , which others have tried to do for over 50 years,” Cheung wrote. So far, Trump’s equivocation on the issue has not deterred Republican voters, with the GOP electorate continuing to support him over any other candidate by a wide margin. At a recent Trump event in Fort Dodge, Iowa, 65-year-old retiree Dean Avery said he didn’t take Trump’s comments on abortion too seriously, despite his own opposition to the procedure in most cases. “Trump says a lot of things … but he gets the stuff done,” Avery said. Democrats plan to make the issue a central one in a general election and spend tens of millions in the fall to remind voters that Trump did more than any president to restrict abortion — believing it will be an albatross for the Republican ticket, Democratic operatives say. “The terrifying reality American women are facing today falls squarely at the feet of Donald Trump,” said Shea Necheles, a spokeswoman for the Biden campaign. “Trump and his campaign can spin his record all they want, but American women know they no longer have the guaranteed freedom to make their own health-care decisions because of Donald Trump.” Top antiabortion leaders have continued to push Trump behind the scenes to embrace a national abortion ban — with Dannenfelser lobbying for a national 15-week law and Hawkins standing behind a far more restrictive six-week ban. But Trump has shown no signs of budging on the issue, according to his advisers. In one meeting with antiabortion advocates at his club last year, Trump told a group of conservative leaders that he’d gotten them what they wanted — the fall of  — and that now it was up to them to win in the states, according to a person who attended the meeting. At other times, according to advisers, Trump told antiabortion advocates that he will make a deal later but was not interested in a national ban. A person close to Trump said the former president had been briefed on abortion pills but hadn’t decided whether he would take action to further restrict their use if he returns to the White House. The person, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said Trump was interested in “Washington’s role” in limiting abortions and noted top officials in the first Trump administration had met during his term to discuss ways government agencies could reduce the procedure. Cheung said Trump had given antiabortion advocates “negotiating power they have never had before.” “President Trump has always advised fellow Republicans that they must learn to talk about this critical issue the right way and remind voters that it is Democrats who are the extreme ones on abortion, not Republicans, despite the left’s attempt to paint it that way,” he said. Trump “faces no pressure right now” from the conservative movement, said Marc Short, chief of staff for former vice president  . “From some of the pro-life groups, there is a recognition that a large number of their supporters are pro-Trump, so there is a reluctance to be critical.” After saying last spring that Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America would oppose any candidate that did not back a 15-week national abortion law, Dannenfelser in a statement this week only called for Trump to publicly attack Democrats for supporting what she called “painful late-term abortion.” To advance their ultimate goal of blocking abortion access nationwide — not just in red states — the primary target for many antiabortion advocates is medication abortion, a two-step regimen now used in over 50 percent of abortions nationwide. The Supreme Court will consider a case this spring that could reinstitute restrictions on mifepristone, one of two drugs used to end a pregnancy, that would make the medication far more difficult to access. But the courts are not the only way to further restrict abortion pills, said Severino, the former HHS official under Trump who now works at the Heritage Foundation. Under a Republican administration, the HHS could decide on its own to reimpose restrictions on mifepristone, which would include requiring an in-person visit with a medical professional. A particularly aggressive HHS secretary and FDA commissioner could even revisit the initial approval of the drug, which has been used widely in the United States for more than 20 years. While the FDA has traditionally stayed out of politics — and been run by people who are generally nonpartisan — a Trump administration could decide to break with those norms, said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University School of Law who focuses on abortion policy. “If we’re in a world where Trump and his administration decide that they’re just going to do it anyway, then all bets are off,” he said. Cohen said that if the FDA decided to rescind approval of mifepristone, the agency would first need to navigate legal hurdles. The manufacturer of the drug would need to be heard in court, and then the decision would be subject to appellate review, he added. David Gortler, a former senior adviser to the FDA commissioner under Trump, noted that the agency has taken drugs off the market before. One major challenge to halting the flow of mifepristone, he said, would be employees at the FDA — but he added that a strong commissioner could probably navigate around them. “The FDA commissioner could always reassign people,” Gortler said. A Republican Justice Department could also take aim at abortion pills. The Heritage document suggests that a Republican administration could enforce the long-dormant Comstock laws from the 1800s, which ban the mailing of abortion pills — a move that could stop any individual from legally receiving abortion pills in the mail and could even disrupt abortion care at clinics, which also receive supplies through the mail. “I think the right person appointed to the Department of Justice could look at this and say, ‘Wait a minute, Democrats have known about this law for decades. … Now we’re finding out that they’ve been ignoring it the whole time, hoping nobody will uphold the rule of law,’” Hawkins of Students for Life said. Antiabortion advocates declined to cite specific names of appointees they would like to see join a Trump administration. But, Hawkins said, Trump’s Cabinet picks would be key to the future of abortion access across the country. Students for Life is looking for Trump to appoint people who are “stridently against abortion,” she said — rather than someone who is opposed to abortion in theory but “doesn’t want to wade into controversial issues.” Severino, who wrote the portion of the Heritage document that pertains to HHS, said he feels “confident” that Trump would appoint an HHS secretary who is “pro-life.” In the GOP primary, many Republican voters do not view abortion as central to their 2024 vote, even if they supported the overturning of  and new restrictions in their home states Many recognize that federal restrictions are difficult to pass even with a Republican president. At Trump’s rally in Fort Dodge this fall, attendee Diana Dierson said she was strongly opposed to abortion unless the pregnant person is endangered and said she wants to see some sort of national restriction. Yet she was all-in for Trump, despite his recent criticism of six-week bans like the one that passed last year in Iowa — convinced that the former president’s record spoke for itself. “He is for the people. He knows what he’s doing. He’s a businessman,” Dierson said. “Our economy was better then. Everything was better then.” Exiting the post office in Sioux City, Iowa, Trump supporter Eugene Means said he thought abortion should be left up to the states. “Because when our constitution was set up, the power lies with the people in the state government, not federal government,” Means said. While Means disagreed with Trump on six-week abortion bans, he said he was willing to look past his comments. “There’s a lot of things I like about him,” Means said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTAAU5ZCK2VCGUKE3ZFA5ZNJNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTAAU5ZCK2VCGUKE3ZFA5ZNJNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTAAU5ZCK2VCGUKE3ZFA5ZNJNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTAAU5ZCK2VCGUKE3ZFA5ZNJNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTAAU5ZCK2VCGUKE3ZFA5ZNJNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NTAAU5ZCK2VCGUKE3ZFA5ZNJNU_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/trump-abortion/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 06:00:00,
"Colin Abrams transferred to Bullis after claiming the Maryland 3A 800-meter state title last year at Magruder as a sophomore, looking for a larger challenge at a national powerhouse. The first one didn’t come at an indoor track meet but from his new coach at practice. “He’s leading the reps but I can tell there’s more in him, so I challenged him. I said, ‘Listen, you’ve got to run the reps as if you are competing against the top runners in the country,’ ” Coach Joe Lee said. “Now I’m watching him blow his times out of the water. … If he continues on this track, I don’t think there’s any limits to what he can do.” Colin Abrams transferred to Bullis after claiming the Maryland 3A 800-meter state title last year at Magruder as a sophomore, looking for a larger challenge at a national powerhouse.

The newcomer was one of two Bulldogs to record the top time in the country this season in their events — 1 minute 53.84 seconds in the 800-meter run, which Lee believes Abrams could vastly improve on over the course of the season. Junior Sydney Sutton set the other top time with a personal-best 38.19 seconds in the girls’ 300-meter dash. The junior finished with a top-five time in the nation last year and was joined in the top five early on this season by teammate Payton Payne, who ran a 39.00 in the same event. Those performances, along with five other top-five marks in the country by teammates  , Morgan Rothwell, Kassidy Hopkins, Kennedy Flynn and Payne in their events, encouraged Lee and the Bulldogs as they enter 2024. “It was successful because we had several standout performances that really kind of set us up for where we feel we’re going to have a good season,” Lee said. Amid the excitement of the puck skimming across the ice and into the net, it can be easy to forget that an intricate system governs how players position themselves on defense to create space and shut down opposing scoring lanes. For Langley, the work done off the puck is just as important as offensive prowess. Senior defenseman Aidan Jacques said the Saxons’ success stems from attention to detail more than just talent — and balancing skill and physicality is core to understanding any successful defense. The defensive duo is an intensely cooperative system, and Jacques is lucky that he has had the same partner, senior Christopher Valko, for all four years on the squad. They also play on the same club team, the Reston Raiders, and all that experience together gives them an instinctual connection on the ice. “We communicate really well. We know each other’s tendencies,” Jacques said. “There’s obviously communication, like yelling if we’re looking for a pass. … But on the power play, if I get the puck, I know he’s going to drive [to the] far side and I can just find him, and we don’t even have to say anything.” That chemistry has served the Saxons well. The back-to-back defending   are 5-0. After the holiday break, they will face a solid Oakton squad Friday. A new season brings roster turnover for every team. In the case of Georgetown Visitation, the reigning   champion, that turnover included seven departing seniors. Adding to the challenge, Visitation was without   for two of its first four games because of obligations to her club team. But the Cubs picked up right where they left off, starting the season 4-0-0 with each win coming against a MAGHL opponent. “I was a little nervous going into the season, but our team is really working well together,” assistant captain Allie Rhea said. “We’re hoping to live up to what we did last season.” Said goalie and captain Annaka Peterson: “At the end of the day, it’s just a game that we all enjoy and love to play with our friends. And [right now] we’re doing amazing, and we have an amazing team.” The Cubs will begin the second half of their season Wednesday against St. Mary’s Ryken. “My hope is to win another MAGHL championship,” Thiessen said. “And so far, we’re on that track.” Fifty-five teams descended on Woodbridge High for the annual Battle at the Bridge tournament this past weekend, and none from the D.C. area performed better than McLean. The squad finished third, with five wrestlers placing in their weight classes. “We were hoping to be top 10, but to end up third we were super excited. Really overjoyed with it,” assistant coach Jay Lewey said. Junior Jacob Daly took home the title at 126 pounds despite entering as the No. 7 seed. He worked his way past three higher-seeded opponents — including the top two — and capped his run with a pin in the final. Offseason development has been pivotal to McLean’s success. Lewey runs the team’s spring and summer programs, and he saw Tavian Melvin, Will Lewey and John Drury wrestle more than 40 matches in the spring and summer. They challenged themselves against elite competition in national and regional events, which has paid off this winter. Melvin wrestled with the junior varsity team last year but placed eighth at 113 pounds over the weekend. Lewey, a team captain who also plays football, finished third among 190-pounders. Drury, who is committed to Roanoke College, overcame an opponent who had pinned him twice this season to place third in the heavyweight division. “We go out and hunt the very best competition in the state to really let all of these young men test their mettle,” Jay Lewey said. “… We’re really excited about what this team could accomplish.” Sean Barbour was a Division I swimmer at La Salle and   He’s also the big brother to Frederick Douglass High sophomore Alex Barbour, another emerging swimmer. But the younger brother was tired of being compared to his older brother all the time. Even though Barbour started swimming at 4, he lost his love for the sport after local pools were shut down during the   pandemic. He quit swimming in 2020 to start playing football. He also wanted to stop being reminded that he was Sean’s little brother. “I wanted to create my own path,” Barbour said. Despite playing well on the gridiron, Barbour started to ache for swimming again. A conversation with a college swimming coach convinced him, and he decided to return to the pool full time. The transition back to swimming was hard; Barbour said he felt slow and heavy in the water because of all the weightlifting he did for football. But Barbour said his stamina is much higher now, allowing him to compete in longer events. He also trains under a military program and hopes to be a Navy SEAL. The sophomore has slowly started to replicate his brother’s success. He finished in the top 10 at the Collegiate Series North Carolina meet for the 50-yard freestyle and the 100-backstroke last year. Unlike his brother, who attended DeMatha, Barbour swims at Douglass. It’s a way he can leave his own legacy. “He is the most dedicated and focused high school athlete I’ve ever seen, and I will probably never coach a kid like him again,” Douglass Coach Matthew Brannagan said. “He’s that talented.” Freedom (South Riding) Coach Kelsey Laird knew this season would bring growing pains. Some of her gymnasts are competing for the first time. But it took just three meets for Freedom to capture its first victory. The Eagles won Dec. 18 — their last meet before the winter break — by topping host Park View, Broad Run, Loudoun Valley and Rock Ridge. The program, once a Northern Virginia power, is trying to establish itself again. The Eagles’ early-season win is an indication they may be on their way back to the top. Freedom won state championships in 2018 and 2019, a stretch led by Sydney Wrighte, who won two state all-around titles before competing at Auburn. She’s back with the team as a volunteer assistant. “The girls definitely look up to her,” said Laird, who is in her fourth season with Freedom and her second as head coach. “You can tell she loves the sport.” With an accomplished former gymnast back with the program, Freedom could be on track to reestablish its place among the area’s top squads. “We have a young team — a lot of girls that haven’t done gymnastics in a few years or haven’t done gymnastics at all,” Wrighte said. “They’re starting off and I’m starting off, and we’re all getting our footing.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMDXVD4WSRC3TBXG74DZJAR4NA_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMDXVD4WSRC3TBXG74DZJAR4NA_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMDXVD4WSRC3TBXG74DZJAR4NA_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMDXVD4WSRC3TBXG74DZJAR4NA_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMDXVD4WSRC3TBXG74DZJAR4NA_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMDXVD4WSRC3TBXG74DZJAR4NA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/02/bullis-track-nabs-two-nation-best-times-defensive-duo-leads-langley-hockey/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 14:13:00,
"PITTSBURGH — 2023 ended on a sour note for the Washington Capitals, with four straight losses and a sputtering offense that, on many nights in December, could muster just one or two goals. But in their first game of 2024, against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night at PPG Paints Arena, the Capitals turned the page. It wasn’t a seamless performance — and it turned dicey toward the end — but four first-period goals provided enough cushion for the Capitals to emerge with a 4-3 win. PITTSBURGH — 2023 ended on a sour note for the Washington Capitals, with four straight losses and a sputtering offense that, on many nights in December, could muster just one or two goals. But in their first game of 2024, against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Tuesday night at PPG Paints Arena, the Capitals turned the page. It wasn’t a seamless performance — and it turned dicey toward the end — but four first-period goals provided enough cushion for the Capitals to emerge with a 4-3 win. “Best start of ’24, you know? New year, new start,” said captain Alex Ovechkin, who had the Capitals’ final goal. “We’ll take it. Great start, then we kind of maybe relaxed a little bit. Gave them kind of belief, but in the third, I think we played solid game.” Goaltender Darcy Kuemper made 32 saves, including stopping all 13 shots he faced in the third period, to earn the win in a matchup of Metropolitan Division rivals fighting for playoff position. Before Tuesday, the Capitals (18-11-6) hadn’t won at all in four games and hadn’t won in regulation   — which was also the last time they scored at least four goals. The previous time Washington scored four goals in a period was  . But winger Tom Wilson set the tone early with a top-corner snipe off the rush just 55 seconds in; it was his 11th goal of the season and ended an eight-game drought. “We were playing really well — maybe one of our best periods of the year,” Wilson said. “We made it a little harder on ourselves than we probably needed to. ... We’ve got to do a better job just kind of managing those big moments, but some really good things to look back on.” Winger Beck Malenstyn, who hadn’t lit the lamp in 19 games before he scored in  , found the net again midway through the period. It was a fortuitous bounce for Malenstyn — Penguins defenseman Ryan Graves deflected the puck over goalie Tristan Jarry and into the net — but Malenstyn’s speed and hard drive to the net helped create the goal. Those two goals in the first 11:16 already matched Washington’s best goal output since it scored three times Dec. 21 at Columbus, but the Capitals weren’t finished. Defenseman Martin Fehervary made it 3-0 with an individual effort: He picked up the puck along the goal line, cycled toward the top of the offensive zone, faked a drop pass and found a shooting lane to score from long range at 13:02. Jarry, who allowed three goals on seven shots, was pulled after that. Washington showed a new power-play alignment at Monday’s practice, with Ovechkin moving from his office in the left faceoff circle to the right point, just inside the blue line. Coach Spencer Carbery wasn’t sure if the Capitals would use it in the game, but on the man advantage late in the period, Ovechkin fired a wrist shot from the point that beat backup goalie Alex Nedeljkovic (14 saves) through traffic. The goal was Ovechkin’s 830th and made Nedeljkovic the 172nd goalie he has scored on. “At the time, you think it’s potentially maybe a little insignificant,” Carbery said. “But it becomes the difference in the game.” Washington came within four seconds of leaving the first period with a 4-0 lead. But Rickard Rakell wired a one-timer from the top of the slot to get Pittsburgh (18-14-4) on the scoresheet. The Penguins, who had won three in a row, carried that momentum into the second period. “From a structural standpoint and us being able to slow them down, us being able to break their forecheck pressure cleanly for the most part, we were really, really sharp early on in the game and were able to grab hold of that thing,” Carbery said. “Would’ve liked to have finished that period the right way. That last shift, we get away from it in a couple of instances there. Next thing you know, it’s in the back of our net. That was a big moment. Now, all of a sudden they’ve got a little bit of life going into that intermission.” After increasingly chaotic sequences around Kuemper’s crease, at even strength and while on the penalty kill, the Penguins’ Sidney Crosby deflected the puck into the net on the power play to cut the Penguins’ deficit to 4-2 at 9:11. Drawing energy from a home crowd that had been silent for much of the first period, Pittsburgh continued to push, and when Jake Guentzel cut the Capitals’ lead to 4-3 with 1:06 left in the second, it almost felt inevitable. The Capitals had to kill a holding penalty on Fehervary early in the third period, and they escaped by the skin of their teeth. The Penguins had multiple chances, including a cross-zone pass from Crosby to set up a backdoor tip that Guentzel sent just wide. The Capitals again had to kill a penalty with 9:20 left when defenseman Ethan Bear went off for holding, too. The second time around, Pittsburgh was less threatening, but it was nonetheless a white-knuckle two minutes for Washington amid a white-knuckle final 40 minutes as its control of the game slipped. But the Capitals have learned how to win these games, even when they are playing with fire for long stretches. The final seconds, with Nedeljkovic pulled for an extra attacker, were tense, but center Nic Dowd won the final faceoff — his 10th win of the game and his seventh win against Crosby — to seal the victory. “The second period was a disaster for lack of a better term,” Carbery said. “But we still had 20 minutes to go and were protecting a lead.

Bomb threats at government buildings in at least five states were reported Thursday, one day after similar threats forced lockdowns and evacuations at state capitols and courthouses across the country Wednesday. Additional security threats were reported Thursday in  ,  ,  ,   and Wisconsin, according to officials and local news outlets. In Arkansas, Pulaski County government officials received a bomb threat Thursday morning that prompted evacuations of the county’s courthouse, juvenile court and district court. All were   within two hours. “Multiple bomb threats” were reported at various locations across Mississippi on Thursday morning, according to the Mississippi Department of Public Safety. The department said precautionary measures were being taken at all locations and that bomb teams had been deployed to the sites in question but did not provide further updates. The Mississippi Capitol had been evacuated Wednesday because of a similar threat, but a search of the building found no explosives or suspicious equipment. In Maine and Florida, multiple courthouses were evacuated, and then cleared to reopen, because of similar threats. The Wisconsin Supreme Court clerk’s office received a threat by email Thursday, but Wisconsin Capitol Police found no danger after investigating the building. That office is across the street from the state capitol, which had received a threat the day before. In a statement Friday, the FBI said it was aware of “the numerous hoax bomb threats sent to various government buildings and other facilities” and urged the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. “The FBI takes hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk,” the FBI said. “While we have no information to indicate a specific and credible threat, we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to gather, share, and act upon threat information as it comes to our attention.” The Thursday threats follow similar security concerns that were reported in more than a dozen state capitols Wednesday, in  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  and Arizona.

"The firing-and-hiring season for NFL coaches is almost at hand. Three teams got early starts by firing their head coaches during the season. The Las Vegas Raiders dismissed Josh McDaniels  . The Carolina Panthers ousted Frank Reich  . The Los Angeles Chargers fired Brandon Staley  . The firing-and-hiring season for NFL coaches is almost at hand. Three teams got early starts by firing their head coaches during the season. The Las Vegas Raiders dismissed Josh McDaniels  . The Carolina Panthers ousted Frank Reich  . The Los Angeles Chargers fired Brandon Staley  . Some agents who represent coaches have said in recent weeks they expect two to four more head coaching jobs to become available. That could be conservative. Others in the sport have speculated there could be more. There has been speculation practically all season about the status of Bill Belichick, whose six Super Bowl triumphs with the New England Patriots have given way to a frustrating existence without quarterback Tom Brady that has included three losing seasons and only one playoff appearance in four years. Patriots owner Robert Kraft   with this season’s on-field struggles, telling the league-owned NFL Network before a Nov. 12 defeat to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany, “This isn’t what we were expecting to happen this year.” The Patriots have played better recently, leading some to wonder whether Kraft might be willing to retain Belichick with changes to the front office and coaching staff, if Belichick would agree to that. Belichick’s contract reportedly runs through next season. But if Kraft and Belichick decide to part ways and Kraft wants to receive draft-pick compensation from another team interested in hiring Belichick in what amounts to a trade, the process might take a little while to play out. The Washington Commanders are widely expected to fire their coach, Ron Rivera, as part of sweeping organizational changes under the new ownership group led by Josh Harris. It was too late for Harris and his ownership partners to make major changes when NFL team owners  . Harris’s group gave everyone in the organization at least one season  . The issue now is whether Harris’s group will make changes to both the football and business sides simultaneously or focus on football first and delay any moves on the business side. Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank has not said whether he will retain his coach, Arthur Smith. There has been some speculation by media members that a team looking for a coach might seek to make a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers to be able to hire Mike Tomlin. Harris and Panthers owner David Tepper have been Steelers limited partners. Harris and David Blitzer, a member of Harris’s ownership group with the Commanders, had not sold their Steelers shares as of the NFL owners meeting last month, a person familiar with the situation said then. They must do so, under NFL rules, but they did not need to do so immediately. The Steelers are well known for their head coaching continuity, so it’s not certain that they would part with Tomlin even if another team makes an effort to pry him away. They have had three head coaches since 1969 and have never had a losing season during Tomlin’s 17-year tenure. They remain in AFC playoff contention entering their regular season finale Saturday in Baltimore. Mike Tomlin’s BFF Jay Glazer leaves the door open for a Tomlin trade this offseason. Don’t rule it out if Glazer says it.  There also has been conjecture that the Patriots could attempt to trade for Tennessee Titans Coach Mike Vrabel, a former Patriots linebacker, if they do not retain Belichick. Some view Jerod Mayo, the Patriots’ linebackers coach and de facto defensive coordinator, as the likely successor, whenever Belichick exits. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson has said he will retain his coach, Robert Saleh, and general manager, Joe Douglas, despite the team’s disappointing season. The Chicago Bears reportedly are increasingly likely to keep Matt Eberflus. It appears the New York Giants’ Brian Daboll and the New Orleans Saints’ Dennis Allen probably will be retained. But many coaching cycles include at least one unexpected dismissal. The regular season ends Sunday. Awards are regular season awards, so here’s a quick assessment of one perspective with one weekend remaining.  He has been the best player on the best team. He thoroughly outplayed the other leading contender, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, in the Ravens’ victory in Week 16. Then he played even better in   over the Miami Dolphins. Jackson was the MVP in the 2019 season, when the Ravens were the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs but lost a divisional-round game at home to the Titans. They’ll have to hope for better this time around.  The Browns have had four  starting quarterbacks. They’ve lost Deshaun Watson, tailback Nick Chubb and offensive tackles Jack Conklin, Jedrick Wills Jr. and Dawand Jones to season-ending injuries. But they’re headed to the playoffs, and they could be very dangerous once they get there. Stefanski deserves credit for that.  Yes, it’s a cop-out to split the award. But how do you choose? They’ve both been phenomenal.  Garrett edges out fellow top pass rushers such as Micah Parsons of Dallas, T.J. Watt of Pittsburgh and Maxx Crosby of Las Vegas. Any would be deserving. And there should be some consideration given to Cowboys cornerback DaRon Bland after he set a single-season record with five touchdowns on interception returns.  This comes down to a choice between Hamlin and Joe Flacco and one question: Coming back from what? Flacco has been terrific for the Browns,   after no team would sign him for much of the season. But Hamlin must be recognized here for   after collapsing and   in Cincinnati during a January game last season.  It’s a toss-up between Stroud and Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua. Stroud is the NFL’s sixth-rated passer and gets the nod here over Nacua despite his 1,445 receiving yards.  Carter fell to the Eagles with the No. 9 selection   because of  , including his   to charges of racing and reckless driving in connection with the Jan. 15 crash in which two people with ties to the Georgia football program were killed. But it always was clear he was talented enough to be one of the top few picks. And that’s how he has played. The Ravens clinched the top seed in the AFC playoffs and will have the AFC’s lone opening-round bye and home-field advantage through the AFC championship game if they advance that far. They didn’t get that far when they last were the No. 1 seed in the 2019 season, losing a divisional-round game at home to the Titans. Harbaugh was asked Sunday whether he would consult with other coaches about his team’s postseason preparations. He mentioned Kansas City Chiefs Coach Andy Reid, his onetime boss in Philadelphia, and Belichick as his prospective resources on the topic. “Andy’s my guy,” Harbaugh said. “It’s kind of hard to call him, though, because he’s also in the playoffs. He probably won’t give me any good answers. I’ll probably talk to Coach Belichick. But really, I think you’ve just got to talk to your guys, talk to guys like [linebacker Roquan Smith], talk to guys like Lamar and come up with a plan. … We remember ’19. … It’s not something we’re going to forget. It’s one more thing that kind of makes you who you are at this point in time.” The Bears have locked up the No. 1 selection in  the 2024 draft, courtesy of possessing the Panthers’ pick as part of the   to choose quarterback Bryce Young with the top selection last year. The Bears have an interesting decision to make. They could retain the top pick, use it on the quarterback of their choice — probably Southern California’s Caleb Williams or North Carolina’s Drake Maye — and trade Justin Fields. Current 2024 NFL Draft order heading into Week 18: 🏈Bears (via Panthers) 2-14* 🏈Commanders - 4-12 🏈Patriots - 4-12 🏈Cardinals - 4-12 🏈Giants - 5-11 *clinched  Or they could remain committed to Fields as their franchise quarterback. In that case, they could trade the No. 1 pick, gain additional selections and move down — but perhaps not too far — to build around Fields. If they trade down only a few spots, they perhaps still could land Ohio State wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. Fields has made progress this season and enters the finale with 16 touchdown passes, nine interceptions and a passer rating of 85.8. The Bears have won four of their past five games to improve to 7-9. That has bolstered the case for them to keep Eberflus as their coach. And it could be an argument in favor of staying the course with Fields at quarterback. But if the Bears believe Williams is a can’t-miss star, they have to take him. It is a decision that will go a long way toward determining the franchise’s level of on-field success for a decade or so. The Browns are in the AFC playoff field, having clinched their spot with a 37-20 triumph Thursday night over the Jets in Cleveland. They have the look of a team that could be a threat to the conference’s top contenders. The Browns lead the league in total defense. And the offense has been perfectly functional with Flacco at quarterback. He threw for 296 yards and three touchdowns in the first half Thursday even without wide receiver Amari Cooper, who was on the inactive list because of a heel injury. Flacco managed only 13 second-half passing yards, but the outcome was well in hand. Flacco gives the Browns a viable passing game. His pass-catchers are good enough when Cooper, wideout Elijah Moore and tight end David Njoku are in the lineup. Garrett is a game-wrecker on defense, and the Browns are capable of shutting down anybody. Joe. Flacco. 🤯 (via  ) This is their second postseason appearance in four seasons under Stefanski. When they reached the playoffs in the 2020 season, Stefanski had to watch the Browns’ opening-round victory at Pittsburgh   at home after testing positive  . They raced to a 28-0 lead over the Steelers in the first quarter before holding on to prevail, 48-37. Those Browns then lost a divisional-round game in Kansas City to the Chiefs. That playoff appearance came with Baker Mayfield at quarterback. He was in his third season after being chosen by the Browns with the top pick in the 2018 draft. The Browns went a combined 15-19 the previous two seasons. They cast aside Mayfield before the 2022 season by trading a king’s ransom of draft picks   and signing him to a five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract. That has not worked out. But Flacco has been the quarterback solution for the Browns that Watson has not been, at least to this point, and they will be an intriguing team to watch during the postseason. Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh hired agent Don Yee to represent him, a person familiar with the matter confirmed after  . That is an interesting move as Harbaugh reportedly contemplates signing a contract extension with Michigan that would prohibit him from returning to the NFL   while potentially also evaluating his NFL head coaching prospects in what has become a practically annual ritual. Yee is a well-connected agent who represents Denver Broncos Coach Sean Payton and Tom Brady, among others. Multiple people familiar with the leaguewide head coach hiring process said they believe Harbaugh may have hired Yee with the possibility of being considered for the Raiders’ job in mind. Raiders owner Mark Davis must decide whether to retain his interim coach, Antonio Pierce. It is possible but not definite that the NFL   of any NCAA-imposed suspension of Harbaugh resulting from the investigation of allegations of improper scouting and sign-stealing, people familiar with the situation have said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CPHORXCCVCAQPW4MGDE7QPIFFM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CPHORXCCVCAQPW4MGDE7QPIFFM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CPHORXCCVCAQPW4MGDE7QPIFFM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CPHORXCCVCAQPW4MGDE7QPIFFM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CPHORXCCVCAQPW4MGDE7QPIFFM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CPHORXCCVCAQPW4MGDE7QPIFFM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/nfl-rankings-bill-belichick/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 06:00:00,

The moment Justin Gilmore crossed the basketball to his left hand, he knew he had to go rogue. Handling the ball on the final play of overtime Wednesday in a tense, back-and-forth game against No. 3 Bullis, the Jackson-Reed guard was supposed to drive to his right and look for a foul or a chance to kick it out. But Gilmore decided to fake to his right and change things up. When his defender hesitated, a gaping path to the hoop opened — a rare and welcome sight in a game dominated by defense. Gilmore attacked the rim, finishing with a layup while getting fouled, a three-point play that proved to be the difference in a thrilling 61-58 win for the No. 6 Tigers. “As soon as he bit on the crossover, I knew it would be wide open and I knew I was going to the hoop,” Gilmore said. The game was the second matchup of a triple-header played at St. John’s as part of the second annual   Invitational. The event is named for Patrick Behan, the former St. John’s coach who is  .

Jackson-Reed (14-2) and Bullis (9-2) met last season in this event. The Bulldogs came away with a 58-56 win that was decided in the final seconds. Tigers Coach Tee Johnson told his players before Wednesday’s game to expect another tight contest. “We knew it was going to be a battle,” Johnson said. “Same venue, same date. And it turned out to be a pretty similar game this year. I think the difference was more guys were able to step up for us.” Jackson-Reed spent much of the fourth quarter looking for one key stop. Time and again, the Tigers would cut Bullis’s lead to one possession, but they couldn’t produce the defense to manage a tie or grab the lead. Bullis would push its lead back to four or five, and the clock would continue to drain. Finally, with less than 90 seconds remaining, Bullis ran out of answers. Senior guard Lucas Sekasi (team-high 17 points) scored on the other end, giving Jackson-Reed its first lead of the half at 49-48. The game went to overtime with the score tied at 51. “Our identity is always going to be defense, no matter what kind of group we have,” Sekasi said. “We’re talented on offense this year, but our identity is always going to come from getting stops.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYUOM2NTJKNZS65MZH5RP2ZCRM_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYUOM2NTJKNZS65MZH5RP2ZCRM_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYUOM2NTJKNZS65MZH5RP2ZCRM_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYUOM2NTJKNZS65MZH5RP2ZCRM_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYUOM2NTJKNZS65MZH5RP2ZCRM_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HYUOM2NTJKNZS65MZH5RP2ZCRM_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/jackson-reed-bullis-behan-strong/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 21:09:00,
"The Washington Capitals have shown a knack for keeping themselves in the game over the season’s first few months. Whether it’s overcoming a deficit, hanging on in late-game defensive situations or finding a timely goal to stage a rally, Washington has made a habit of fighting back. But Wednesday, in a 6-3 loss to the New Jersey Devils at Capital One Arena, there simply wasn’t enough fight for another comeback. The Capitals erased New Jersey’s early two-goal lead to tie the score late in the second period, but the Devils continued to push and Washington couldn’t keep pace. The Washington Capitals have shown a knack for keeping themselves in the game over the season’s first few months. Whether it’s overcoming a deficit, hanging on in late-game defensive situations or finding a timely goal to stage a rally, Washington has made a habit of fighting back. But Wednesday, in a 6-3 loss to the New Jersey Devils at Capital One Arena, there simply wasn’t enough fight for another comeback. The Capitals erased New Jersey’s early two-goal lead to tie the score late in the second period, but the Devils continued to push and Washington couldn’t keep pace. “We got back into the game every time, seemingly,” defenseman John Carlson said. “But we just couldn’t keep the foot on the gas even more.” Goaltender Hunter Shepard made 22 saves on 28 shots for Washington. Nico Daws stopped 23 of 26 for the Devils. The Devils arrived in Washington on Tuesday as the Capitals were in Pittsburgh to play the Penguins, and it was abundantly clear in the first period which team was rested. New Jersey jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first 10 minutes, with two goals from captain Nico Hischier, while the Capitals had just two shots on goal in the same span. The Devils looked crisp and connected on every shift while Washington struggled to maintain possession, let alone string together positive sequences. The Devils scored their first goal just over three minutes in on a rebound from a shot by Colin Miller that Shepard sent directly to Hischier. His second came on the power play after winger Max Pacioretty was whistled for tripping at 9:15. Pacioretty, making his Capitals debut and playing in his first game since   last January, tripped John Marino as the Devils came up the ice on the rush. New Jersey’s power play is the best in the league, carrying a 30.3 percent conversion rate into Wednesday’s game, and it needed little time to find the back of the net. At the front of the net, Hischier tipped a point shot from Luke Hughes up and over Shepard just 35 seconds into the man advantage. It wasn’t until the Capitals went on the power play with just over three minutes left in the period that they started to wake up. The first unit didn’t produce much, but late in the second unit’s shift, center Connor McMichael beat Daws with a top-corner snipe from the right faceoff circle — his seventh goal of the season and first power-play goal in the NHL. Center Nic Dowd hit the post with 14 seconds left in the period, coming inches from sending Washington to intermission with a tying goal. McMichael picked up where he left off to start the second period, skating down the slot on a partial breakaway, but Daws saved his backhand attempt. The Capitals faded somewhat after their early push in the second period, and the Devils quickly took advantage with their speed and creativity. Dawson Mercer made it 3-1 at 8:08 of the second on a quick shot from the slot. But just over three minutes later, Capitals center Evgeny Kuznetsov beat an attempted poke check and slipped a shot over Daws’s right pad to get Washington back within one. The end of the second period was a carbon copy of the end of the first, with Carlson netting a power-play goal to tie the score at 18:58 and Dowd skating in alone on a scoring chance seconds later. But Dowd was stopped, and instead of Washington going into the intermission with momentum from Carlson’s tying goal, a poorly timed pinch by defenseman Martin Fehervary opened up an odd-man rush the other way. Michael McLeod came back up the ice and sent a spinning backhand shot through Shepard’s legs, putting New Jersey up 4-3 with 15.8 seconds left in the second. Just as they did in their  , the Capitals gave up a goal with mere seconds left in a period. On Wednesday, it killed their momentum. “To give that sort of three-on-two up, it’s just something you can’t do,” Washington Coach Spencer Carbery said. “We did the same thing in [Pittsburgh], giving up that late goal. You’ve got to be smart in those situations. A little bit of a young mistake, which puts us — you’ve got all the momentum in the world, the building is alive, you want to go into that intermission. That hurts.” McLeod’s goal sapped the Capitals’ comeback bid. Washington didn’t create anything with a power-play opportunity early in the third period, and the chance was cut short by Alex Ovechkin’s tripping penalty. Though the Devils didn’t score on the ensuing power play, a gaffe in defensive zone coverage shortly after Ovechkin emerged from the box allowed Mercer to net his second of the night and reestablish New Jersey’s two-goal lead. Throughout the game, the Devils’ pace gave Washington problems, and Carbery drew a line from New Jersey’s speed to the Capitals’ inability to push back in the third period. The Capitals didn’t find much traction after Mercer’s goal, and when McLeod made it 6-3 with just over four minutes left, fans headed for the exits. “Just too many mistakes,” Carbery said. “Not enough push at the end. I thought our third period would be a lot better than it was. We didn’t have much of a push, and that’s disappointing.” To provide the roster spot necessary to activate Pacioretty from long-term injured reserve, goaltender Charlie Lindgren was placed on injured reserve. Lindgren suffered an upper-body injury against the New York Islanders on Dec. 29 and is listed as day-to-day.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIHEECYNAEXQGHDJBXEQNUMKL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIHEECYNAEXQGHDJBXEQNUMKL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIHEECYNAEXQGHDJBXEQNUMKL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIHEECYNAEXQGHDJBXEQNUMKL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIHEECYNAEXQGHDJBXEQNUMKL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VIHEECYNAEXQGHDJBXEQNUMKL4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/capitals-devils-carlson-shepard/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 23:14:00,
"CLEVELAND — The benches told the story in the third quarter Wednesday night. There were the Washington Wizards dressed in their whites, staring at the action without speaking. On the other side of the court, the Cleveland Cavaliers resembled a picture of joy — the players in wine and gold were all up on their feet, cheering every time a teammate hit a three-pointer and flexing whenever they grabbed yet another offensive rebound. CLEVELAND — The benches told the story in the third quarter Wednesday night. There were the Washington Wizards dressed in their whites, staring at the action without speaking. On the other side of the court, the Cleveland Cavaliers resembled a picture of joy — the players in wine and gold were all up on their feet, cheering every time a teammate hit a three-pointer and flexing whenever they grabbed yet another offensive rebound. When the Cavaliers delivered consecutive no-look assists to push the lead to 20, it was bedlam. Cleveland had a downright hoot picking apart the Wizards in a 140-101 win at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse, and it was easy to see why. Players up and down the roster bullied Washington on the boards and then finished the job from the three-point line, a one-two punch that led to the Wizards’ second-biggest margin of defeat in this rebuilding season — behind only   last month. The Cavaliers had 20 three-pointers and won the battle on the boards 62-36, the result of what players and Coach Wes Unseld Jr. described as a lack of effort and physicality. “It’s one thing to do it in practice; [it’s another thing] to feel that in real time,” Unseld said of his team’s poor rebounding. “It’s just something that’s got to be a priority for us because it keeps cropping up.” The Cavaliers (19-15) slowly and steadily laid the groundwork for a drubbing in the first half by taking care of the details. Yes, Washington’s defense let them shoot all too efficiently from the three-point line from tip-off, but Cleveland also efficiently converted offensive rebounds and turnovers into easy points. Comfort on offense plus control of those elements was like lighter fluid, and an 8-0 run to end the first half — fueled by a pair of three-pointers from Donovan Mitchell — was all the spark the Cavaliers needed. Max Strus led the onslaught from beyond the arc and ended with a team-high 24 points on 9-for-13 shooting, including 6-for-8 from the three-point line. Mitchell had 22 points, including four three-pointers, and Jarrett Allen rounded out the offense from under the basket. The 6-foot-9 center had 17 points, 19 rebounds and a team-high seven assists. The Wizards (6-27) looked feeble on offense in comparison despite 12 three-pointers. Kyle Kuzma led a slightly stickier offense than usual with 16 points. Center Daniel Gafford was the only other starter in double figures, with 12. Deni Avdija led the team on the boards on his 23rd birthday. All he needed was six rebounds. “It’s just the approach,” Gafford said of the Wizards’ rebounding. “Really just the lack of effort in that area at the end of the day. I take big responsibility on that because of course I want to control the boards, but it’s just taking that extra step, putting your body on the line. . . . They do it to us. Any team that we’ve played, they’re throwing multiple guys, multiple people trying to keep guys off the glass.” Perhaps Washington can take solace in the fact that its chance at revenge arrives quickly — the Wizards visit the Cavaliers again Friday. Here’s what else to know about Wednesday’s loss: Allen wasn’t the only force working the boards for the Cavaliers. Cleveland’s bench was just as productive on offense, especially at the start of the second quarter, when it outscored the Wizards 13-7 in the first four minutes. Tristan Thompson had nine of the bench’s 31 rebounds. The Cavaliers made 6 of 9 three-point attempts in the first quarter, and Strus had 21 points by halftime. Two-way guard Jared Butler started his 2024 with some happy news: After leading the Capital City Go-Go to a pair of impressive wins, he was named the G League player of the week for games played between Dec. 27 and Jan. 1. The former Baylor shooting guard averaged 28 points, 12.5 assists and 4.0 rebounds on 55.3 percent shooting in wins against the Raptors 905 and the Motor City Cruise. “It means a lot,” the ever-cheerful Butler said ahead of Wednesday’s Wizards game, in which he scored five points in nine minutes. “It’s good to know that my hard work and preparation pays off, and just glad to know that my teammates helped me out a lot, too.” It was a mutually beneficial situation. The Go-Go shot 56.8 percent from the field in a 143-109 win over the Raptors 905 as Butler had 13 assists, which is tied for the fourth most by a player in a game. The guard followed his strong performance with 12 assists Dec. 30 against the Motor City Cruise and scored 32 points — the second-highest-scoring game of his career — including a step-back, game-winning three-pointer.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AZIYVJEEFZVAFFOQVJ3OPBL7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AZIYVJEEFZVAFFOQVJ3OPBL7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AZIYVJEEFZVAFFOQVJ3OPBL7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AZIYVJEEFZVAFFOQVJ3OPBL7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AZIYVJEEFZVAFFOQVJ3OPBL7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5AZIYVJEEFZVAFFOQVJ3OPBL7M_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/wizards-cavaliers-three-pointers-defense/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 22:45:00,
"Russia has begun firing ballistic missiles provided by North Korea into Ukraine, the latest sign of cooperation between two of Washington’s archnemeses, the White House said Thursday. Russia’s deployment of North Korean-supplied ballistic missiles, first reported by The Washington Post, indicates North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s growing support for Moscow’s war effort. It also shows Moscow’s ability to lean on pariah countries to make up for deficiencies in its own arsenal as the war in Ukraine approaches its third  year. Russia has begun firing ballistic missiles provided by North Korea into Ukraine, the latest sign of cooperation between two of Washington’s archnemeses, the White House said Thursday. Russia’s deployment of North Korean-supplied ballistic missiles, first reported by The Washington Post, indicates North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s growing support for Moscow’s war effort. It also shows Moscow’s ability to lean on pariah countries to make up for deficiencies in its own arsenal as the war in Ukraine approaches its third  year. “Russia has become increasingly isolated on the world stage and they’ve been forced to look to like-minded states for military equipment,” said White House spokesman John Kirby, who partially attributed Russia’s limited options to sanctions imposed by Washington. Kirby presented a map showing the trajectory of Russia’s first known use of North Korean missiles on Saturday, launching from southern Russia and landing in Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region — an area of intense fighting between Kyiv and Moscow. The first strike landed in an open field, Kirby said. A second strike Tuesday  was part of a larger overnight aerial attack that the United States has less information about. “We’re still assessing the impacts of these additional missiles,” Kirby said. North Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missile launchers and several dozen ballistic missiles, said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss U.S. intelligence. “We expect Russia and North Korea to learn from these launches — and we anticipate that Russia will use additional North Korean missiles to target Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,” Kirby said. Kirby said that the missiles have a range of roughly 550 miles and that their transfer violates multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions. He vowed that the United States would raise the issue at the United Nations and impose sanctions against individuals facilitating arms transfers between North Korea and Russia. “We will not allow countries to aid Russia’s war machine in secret,” Kirby said. U.S. officials believe that in exchange for the ballistic missiles, North Korea is seeking a variety of military equipment from Russia, including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air-missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment and other advanced technologies. Michael Kofman, a military analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Russia’s war effort is being bolstered by imports of weaponry. “Russia’s mobilized defense industrial production is now producing significantly more missiles per month than it was before the war. However, this is still not sufficient relative to its needs and can’t replace the stockpile of missiles it’s expended over the course of the last two years,” he said. “That means that Russia would benefit from having access to an additional stockpile from countries like North Korea.” While officials said Pyongyang had provided “several dozen ballistic missiles” thus far, the extent of the weapons North Korea sent and how much it plans to provide in the coming months remain unclear. In November, South Korea   North Korea of supplying several types of missiles to Russia, including antitank missiles, portable anti-air missiles, ballistic missiles, and rifles, rocket launchers, mortars and shells. The Wall Street Journal previously   that Russia began receiving shipments of North Korean ballistic missiles several weeks ago. The grinding war in Ukraine has seen little movement along the front lines since Kyiv’s stalled summer counteroffensive. But with the advent of winter, both sides have continued to pummel each other with missile and drone attacks. On Thursday, Russia’s Defense Ministry said that its air defenses had repelled a major missile attack by Ukrainian forces on Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014 and Russian forces used as a staging ground for its full-scale invasion in 2022. Russian antiaircraft systems shot down 10 Ukrainian “aircraft-guided missiles,” the ministry said. Mikhail Razvozhayev, governor of the Sevastopol region in Crimea, said on Telegram that the missile attack was the “most massive in recent times” on the peninsula, adding that one person was injured by falling shrapnel. Ukraine’s military said in a statement that it had successfully struck “a command post of a formation of the Russian occupation forces near Sevastopol.” The Russian and Ukrainian claims could not be independently verified. Separately, a Russian missile attack on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskyi on Thursday killed one person and injured eight, Ukraine’s State Emergency Services said. Debris from a missile also damaged a repair and production facility of Ukraine’s state energy operator Ukrenergo, the company said in a statement.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDGUEBFEVPUR2FAN2XIFVORG5U_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDGUEBFEVPUR2FAN2XIFVORG5U_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDGUEBFEVPUR2FAN2XIFVORG5U_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDGUEBFEVPUR2FAN2XIFVORG5U_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDGUEBFEVPUR2FAN2XIFVORG5U_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MDGUEBFEVPUR2FAN2XIFVORG5U_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/04/russia-north-korean-missiles-ukraine/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 16:23:00,
"You know the guy who throws the drink. He’s the guy who screams so loud that bits of hot dog fly out of his mouth. The one who terrorizes his seat section like a soft Napoleon, with his outthrust Bonaparte chin and a chest that has started to landslide into a belly.

You know the guy who throws the drink. He’s the guy who screams so loud that bits of hot dog fly out of his mouth. The one who terrorizes his seat section like a soft Napoleon, with his outthrust Bonaparte chin and a chest that has started to landslide into a belly. When an NFL owner acts like the worst lout in an arena of 70,000, when he throws a drink on a ticket buyer like a feudal lord dousing a serf with a bucket of refuse from his castle, what should the penalty be? In the case of the Carolina Panthers’ David Tepper, the answer is a fine that amounts to a frippery. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, unharried by conscience as usual, concluded that fit punishment for Tepper  , which comes to about 0.0015 percent of his $20 billion in wealth. This touches off all sorts of fun analytical games: Proportionally, it is the equivalent of about $15 — if your net worth is merely $1 million. The cost of three McDonald’s Happy Meals. “I should have let NFL stadium security handle any issues that arose,” Tepper said in an utterly unrepentant statement after he was caught on camera   toward a fan out the window of his luxury suite. “I respect the NFL’s code of conduct and accept the League’s discipline for my behavior.” Now, the only issue that stadium security needed to handle was Tepper. And proper action by the league would be to banish Tepper indefinitely from attending NFL games, just as regular fans have been banned from stadiums for throwing beers on players and as a player, Marcus Peters,   by the Kansas City Chiefs for throwing a penalty flag at spectators in the stands. You would call this a double standard except that it’s no standard at all. The Tepper incident captures the entire NFL landscape in one vicious little incident: Owners are a court of barons with divine rights. Where they are concerned, the NFL’s “personal conduct” policy is nothing but legend, spun around them to disguise the economic pillage they inflict on their players and their fans. A significant part of Goodell’s regime, and his legacy, has been his steady expansion of the personal conduct policy, assigning the league ever greater authority and latitude in disciplining players. The personal conduct policy states that anyone who is part of the NFL in any way must refrain from “conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in” the league. Laughably, the policy even   as the torchbearers for virtuous behavior. “Ownership and club or league management have traditionally been held to a higher standard and will be subject to more significant discipline when violations of the Personal Conduct Policy occur.” Thus, when quarterback Deshaun Watson allegedly solicits sex acts from massage therapists, he is   and sits out for nearly two years, and when Patriots owner Robert Kraft is charged with   for sex acts at a joint called Orchids of Asia — charges that were later dropped — he is never disciplined. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara   to start this season for violating the personal conduct policy during a fight in Las Vegas. And yet it took years of alleged workplace abuses and multiple investigations — including congressional inquiry — for the NFL to be dragged into sanctioning former Washington owner Daniel Snyder. This disproportion is not mere lordly arrogance emanating from the league office. It smacks of calculated strategy. As former Green Bay Packers executive Andrew Brandt   for Sports Illustrated, Goodell’s office has stealthily rewritten the personal conduct policy in a way that hands ever more leverage to management while undermining player rights. The most breathtaking example of this is a new clause that states the league can investigate and discipline a player for conduct that occurred before he was ever employed or even draft-eligible. What’s more, a player must “promptly disclose” any past misconduct to ownership before signing a contract, at peril of voiding it. Speaking of pasts, here is Tepper’s. This was not his first offense, as far as throwing things. Apparently, the hedge funder used to toss breast implants around his office and throw objects at his male employees to humiliate them, according to  . He also mused that sometimes when he didn’t like his service from a waiter, he thought about buying the restaurant, just to fire somebody. And he kept a crude brass sculpture of testicles on his desk. This past was well known to the NFL when it   his purchase of the Carolina franchise from that abiding harasser and racist,  . Tepper’s offense against a ticket buyer was met with a trivial fine, but the effect of it is not trivial at all. It has a pervasive effect, reminding players and fans of that age-old NFL ownership edict: “We’re the ranchers; you’re the cattle.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYZSMW7KJIVQD7OXMEOPZCBATY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYZSMW7KJIVQD7OXMEOPZCBATY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYZSMW7KJIVQD7OXMEOPZCBATY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYZSMW7KJIVQD7OXMEOPZCBATY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYZSMW7KJIVQD7OXMEOPZCBATY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYZSMW7KJIVQD7OXMEOPZCBATY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/david-tepper-drink-panthers/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 14:31:00,
"At some point, nearly every political campaign makes some effort to appeal directly to younger voters. The extent of that outreach varies from candidate to candidate and year to year. But there’s always a pool of young people marginally attached to the political process that campaigns think are worth contacting, if only once. At some point, nearly every political campaign makes some effort to appeal directly to younger voters. The extent of that outreach varies from candidate to candidate and year to year. But there’s always a pool of young people marginally attached to the political process that campaigns think are worth contacting, if only once. From the outset, former ambassador Nikki Haley’s bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination has been to an extent predicated on age. When she announced her candidacy, she made   to the need for a “new generation” of leadership — an obvious effort to contrast her age with those of both   and the front-runner for the GOP nomination,  . (A few weeks ago, she released a campaign ad   Biden’s age.) This reinforces both her opponents’ advanced ages and taps into generational frustrations regularly expressed by younger Americans. On Friday, Haley is slated to hold   who are members of Gen Z, those  . It’s an age group that made up   caucus-goers in the 2016 Iowa contest and could help swing a close contest. It is also a group of voters that is the first to have come of age in the Donald Trump era of politics. Those of us of a certain age (that is, not Gen Z) may still view Trump’s arrival on the American political scene as something relatively recent. In part because of its ongoing saliency to political discussions, 2016 seems relatively recent. But, of course, it is not. Trump announced his first presidential bid 8½ years ago, in June 2015. His presidency began seven years ago this month. He’s been a prominent figure in Republican politics for nearly a decade and the most important figure in the GOP for nearly eight years. I am old, a member of Gen X (those born, according to the Pew Research Center, between 1965 and 1980). Even so, nearly a fifth of my life has elapsed since Trump first came down the escalator in Trump Tower. He’s been a dominant force for a large percentage of my life — and, depending on how old you are, yours. But that’s much more the case for younger Americans, given how percentages work. For those born after the end of Gen Z (a group too young to vote at the moment), nearly their whole lives have unfolded in the Trump era of politics. The percentages decline as birth years increase, but even if you were born 100 years ago today, Trump’s national political career has made up 1 out of every 11 days of your life. If you’re curious about what percentage of your own life has unfolded in the Trump era, you can use the tool below. Also feel free to see what it looks like for someone born in, say, 2000.     It’s not necessarily the case that this is important. But when we consider that nearly 50 percent of the lives of members of Gen Z have elapsed since his 2015 announcement — and significantly more of their  lives — we are reminded of the size of the hill that Haley needs to climb. She’s not just battling Trump. She’s battling the embodiment of Republican politics for most of those voters’ lives. This is admittedly overwrought; voters often have relatively facile guidelines for making political choices, but it’s not necessarily the case that they are simplistically beholden to leaders with whom they’ve grown up.  , though, that younger ages, like those of members of Gen Z at the moment, are more formative in establishing political opinions. And Haley is not talking to young people  ; she’s talking to young Republicans specifically. Or … is she? Efforts are underway to encourage independents or Democrats to turn out for Republican primaries to help non-Trump candidates compete against the former president and current front-runner. Iowa’s caucuses are reserved for Republicans, but voters   with the party on the day of voting. Young independents and Democrats have also spent most of their lives with a Republican Party that exists in Trump’s shadow. Their assessments of that shadow are presumably significantly different than those of younger Republicans — and might make them more receptive to Haley’s candidacy.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6O2KN22JXVSRKBASQ4WNR5UXTI.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6O2KN22JXVSRKBASQ4WNR5UXTI.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6O2KN22JXVSRKBASQ4WNR5UXTI.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6O2KN22JXVSRKBASQ4WNR5UXTI.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6O2KN22JXVSRKBASQ4WNR5UXTI.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6O2KN22JXVSRKBASQ4WNR5UXTI.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/haley-appeal-younger-voters/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 13:36:00,
"CLEVELAND — After the Washington Wizards acquired Tyus Jones last summer in the three-team  , the locker room welcomed two new bodies, not just one.

CLEVELAND — After the Washington Wizards acquired Tyus Jones last summer in the three-team  , the locker room welcomed two new bodies, not just one. Jones is frequently accompanied after games by his mop-topped, 3-year-old son, Tyus Jr., who likes to walk around the locker room saying hello to his dad’s teammates or guarding dad’s chair while he is in the shower. Tyus Jr., Jones said, is just beginning to learn about basketball but knows enough to ask the same question after almost every game: “How many assists did you have?” The answers have been pretty good lately. Less than halfway through his first season as a full-time starting point guard, Jones has been one of the few bright spots on the Wizards (6-27) as they stumble through their first few months of a rebuild. He is adjusting to his new role gracefully, having provided a steadying voice in the locker room and a steadying hand guiding Washington’s offense, when it’s clicking. The 27-year-old is flourishing in the Wizards’ open offense, averaging career highs in points (12.5), field goal percentage (53.1) and three-point percentage (42.6), and, according to the statistical website Cleaning the Glass, has a career-low six percent turnover rate. Plus, he’s a quick study. Jones averaged 10.9 points and 4.9 assists in his first 16 games with Washington. In the next 17 games before Friday night’s matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, those numbers rose to 14 points and 5.8 assists. “[He’s found] that balance of playing fast and trying to score quick versus the execution piece,” Coach Wes Unseld Jr. said recently during a rash of particularly high-scoring games for Jones, including a 22-point night in Phoenix on Dec. 17 and a season-high 24-point performance two games later in a win at Portland on Dec. 21. Unseld also complimented Jones’s improved pick-and-roll defense. Jones’s goal at the outset of the season was in part to prove his value as a starting point guard after mostly leading the second unit for the first four years of his career with the Minnesota Timberwolves before backing up Ja Morant with the Memphis Grizzlies beginning in 2019. He came to Washington with a rock-solid reputation predicated on his reliable, low-turnover game that matched a low-key attitude in the locker room. Washington offered the opportunity for more responsibility in both realms. Jones has attacked the challenge by trying not to think about it too much. Instead, he set about learning, engaging in deep, basketball-related conversations with Unseld, Jordan Poole, Kyle Kuzma and his other teammates. The more questions he can ask, the more he understands his teammates’ wants and needs, and the more he can anticipate what they’re thinking in a game. “The more second nature things are, the quicker you’re getting stuff on court, the quicker you’re making calls and things like that,” Jones said. “Obviously, it’s not literally not thinking about [performing well], but the thinking becoming second nature, trying to know the system like the back of your hand, knowing where guys need to be.” He has ramped up his aggression on offense in the same manner. Jones increased his shot attempts from 9.4 in the first 16 games of the season to 10.4 in the next 17 games, and his three-point attempts have gone up in kind. Jones isn’t actively hunting more of his own shots or creating opportunities for himself but rather reading the defense and being quicker to take shots that are available. “He’s shooting it better from three, which helps and now forces teams to honor him out on the floor, which opens up the pick-and-roll game, opens up the rest of the paint,” Unseld said. Now, Jones’s singular improvement can’t save the Wizards from a dismal season, fix their rebounding affliction or defense. But as impressive as his quick improvement has been on the court, he has been every bit as valuable for the Wizards in the locker room as a leader of a group that, despite its record, has been described by several players as having the best chemistry they’ve experienced in their time in the NBA. Although Jones speaks to reporters with the gravitas of a coach, Poole calls him his funniest teammate. Fourth-year forward Deni Avdija said in a recent interview that Jones has a perfect sense of timing during huddles about when to speak and when to let his teammates have a moment to think and breathe. “He’s so great. He’s got that, like, sarcastic sense of humor, and I feel like more than that, he does a good job of saying the right things at the right time that bring us together,” Avdija said, shrugging as if searching for more to say. “I feel like he’s just an overall good dude who knows how to play basketball.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HVOKJSXIQMZSR3DAOYW7F6GJQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HVOKJSXIQMZSR3DAOYW7F6GJQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HVOKJSXIQMZSR3DAOYW7F6GJQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HVOKJSXIQMZSR3DAOYW7F6GJQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HVOKJSXIQMZSR3DAOYW7F6GJQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5HVOKJSXIQMZSR3DAOYW7F6GJQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/tyus-jones-wizards-cavaliers/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 08:00:00,
"PASADENA, Calif. — Having roared through   unscathed with its brawn and its unity, No. 1 Michigan came across a juncture Monday that asked about its stomach and its nerve endings. It got to four minutes left in a great tussle of a Rose Bowl national semifinal with the darkness descended, the playoff goblins howling, the deficit at seven and the offense in a protracted sputter. PASADENA, Calif. — Having roared through   unscathed with its brawn and its unity, No. 1 Michigan came across a juncture Monday that asked about its stomach and its nerve endings. It got to four minutes left in a great tussle of a Rose Bowl national semifinal with the darkness descended, the playoff goblins howling, the deficit at seven and the offense in a protracted sputter. When it weathered all that with a tying touchdown drive that will live on in the memory banks of its colossal fan base and with an overtime it filled with mastery, it had   over No. 4 Alabama and a refined definition of itself. That definition will include something the Michigan of Jim Harbaugh vintage had not known: a berth in the College Football Playoff national championship game on the closing Monday night in Houston. “Glorious,” said Harbaugh, the ninth-season coach who used to play quarterback for the school. “That was glorious … an epic game, and glorious is how I feel.” A season Michigan managed to freight with its own self-made scandal,   unearthed in October that riveted the sport and dominated barroom chatter, got to 14-0 and to one rung further than the previous two, which ended in stinging playoff defeats. It got all that way because herculean running back Blake Corum sliced and barreled his way leftward to a winning 17-yard touchdown run in overtime, and it got all that way because Alabama’s closing fourth-and-goal play from the 3-yard line disintegrated when Michigan’s defense made a wall that   quickly found impenetrable. It also got all that way because of what happened late in regulation of a game in which Michigan often seemed the better, stouter side. When quarterback J.J. McCarthy, Corum and the vaunted offensive line got started at their own 25-yard line with 4:41 left, their outfit had creaked for 44 total yards since halftime. It had seen the Crimson Tide cobble together enough plays to squeeze out of a 13-10 deficit and eke a 20-13 lead on a 55-yard touchdown drive peppered with Milroe’s bull-in-a-china-shop 18-yard scramble and on a 52-yard field goal from senior Will Reichard, his second 50-plus make of the hard, hard game. By that moment, all 96,371 in the grand old stadium and everyone watching or cowering behind furniture at home knew Michigan had a rarefied cohesion about it, but the question remained:   “What people don’t know,” Harbaugh said, “and how could they know, how could they know what the togetherness is like? There’s nothing that can separate these guys.” The march began. “We weren’t really getting things going,” McCarthy said, “but that’s all in the past” by the time of the first snap. Corum barreled twice for four yards each. A third-down pass fizzled, which meant a fourth and two shouted and sneered. That’s when things began tilting dramatically toward   That’s when McCarthy looked right and saw Corum running out there in shockingly open terrain, flipped him the ball and saw him roar up the right side for a 27-yard gain shortened — but not negated — by a late-stage block-in-the-back penalty. From the 50, McCarthy took off 16 yards through the right. From the 34, McCarthy threw high toward the left to a crossing Roman Wilson, but Wilson reached up and snared it and continued clear to the 5. From the 4 one play later, a lovely thing hatched, with McCarthy faking to Corum headed right, then flipping to Wilson lonely on the left for the tying touchdown with 1:34 left. Alabama’s offense got a chance. It got one first down. It stalled, its downfield passing again nonexistent on a day Milroe finished 16 for 23 for 116 yards, and so the 13th punt of an inelegant game, James Burnip’s boomer, found its way to around the Michigan 10-yard line, where senior wide receiver Jake Thaw muffed it backward, Michigan’s second muff of the game to go with one other near-muff. As Thaw frantically went back to corral the thing at the 1, it seemed this flawed semifinal might end on a flaw. It would not have fit, and so Michigan drained the clock, and overtime began with Corum running for eight yards, Corum for 17, and then Milroe taking off to the Michigan 9-yard line on Alabama’s possession. That would prove Alabama’s final first down of a 12-2 season in which it served as an odd kind of afterthought   in September. It struggled a bit again with an odd woe: snaps from center to quarterback. It took a five-yard loss on second down when Michigan’s Mason Graham crashed in. Then Milroe hit Jermaine Burton on the right sideline for 11 yards to the 3, Josh Wallace crucially tackling him there, and then both sides called timeouts before the fourth down that would end matters. Receivers darted out and cleared the middle for Milroe, but Michigan knew what was up with the scary runner Milroe, who rushed for 63 yards. The snap went back, Milroe went straight into the line, and the whole episode looked hopeless straightaway. “We didn’t get it blocked,” said Alabama Coach Nick Saban, appearing in his eighth playoff in the 10 years of the playoff concept, “so it didn’t work.” “Unfortunately,” Milroe said, after speaking his gratefulness for the role on the play, “we just missed.” “We sent the house,” Michigan linebacker Junior Colson said. “If you really analyze the game,” Saban said, “one of the biggest things is we didn’t really play well on defense when we needed to, and the second thing is we had too many drive-stopping plays.” Suddenly, Michigan’s players, led by McCarthy from the sideline, poured onto the field with a level of mirth they had not known. They had overcome the early muffed punt that helped arrange Alabama’s 7-0 lead on Jase McClellan’s searing 34-yard run. They had overcome the strange behavior of the scoreboard, which somehow didn’t seem to reflect their superiority, registered most in five first-half sacks from all over the field, for edge rusher Braiden McGregor, edge rusher Josaiah Stewart, linebacker Michael Barrett, defensive lineman Kris Jenkins and edge rusher Derrick Moore. They had gotten a 75-yard drive and McCarthy’s eight-yard pass to Corum to tie the score at 7, and they had gotten Tyler Morris’s blazing 38-yard touchdown catch-and-run on a third and 10 to muster a 13-7 lead and a 199-39 advantage in total yards just before halftime. Then they had gotten stuck, and Alabama had gotten going at least somewhat, and nobody knew for sure whether Harbaugh would wind up saying what he said: “I was calm, that fourth quarter, that overtime. I just felt like there was nothing that we couldn’t overcome inside this stadium today.” Nobody knew for sure whether McCarthy would get to say what he said: “Everything we went through this entire year, it made us unbreakable.” So they had first down at the 25, a defense and a long path up ahead. They had fourth down at the 33, a season teetering. Then, several storybook moments later, they had dead goblins and vibrant memories.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XZTRKAWEQAU63R42QRHIPGJBI.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XZTRKAWEQAU63R42QRHIPGJBI.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XZTRKAWEQAU63R42QRHIPGJBI.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XZTRKAWEQAU63R42QRHIPGJBI.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XZTRKAWEQAU63R42QRHIPGJBI.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XZTRKAWEQAU63R42QRHIPGJBI.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/01/michigan-rose-bowl-win-alabama-cfp-final/,Washington Post,2024-01-01 21:22:00,

The simmering crisis in the Middle East, sparked by the start  of the   nearly three months ago, threatens to boil over amid strikes and violence across the region. Notably, tensions are growing despite few indications that actors in the region are eager to fight. Most notably, Iran and its allies have largely refrained from open warfare against Israel and its allies since the Oct. 7 attack led by Hamas. However, experts warn that given the range of actions happening across the region, and the array of actors with different motivations, a simple miscalculation could quickly spiral out of control. “They’re playing a very dangerous game — it’s chicken, basically,” said Joost Hiltermann, a Middle East expert at the International Crisis Group, of the various actors in the Middle East. “Any miscalculation, any miscommunication, any accidental strike could trigger a major escalation.” This week alone has seen the   and a  . Last week, a senior member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was killed in Damascus. In the Red Sea, Yemen’s Houthi rebels have continued their threats to disrupt commercial shipping despite the warning of military action from the United States and its allies. Iran, a key backer of the anti-U.S. “axis of resistance,” is also reeling from a  on Wednesday, for which the Islamic State claimed responsibility. The attack took place at an event commemorating Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani on the fourth anniversary of his assassination in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in 2020. Late last month, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told a parliamentary committee that the country was already defending itself in a “multi-arena” war that went beyond Gaza and the West Bank. “I say here in the most explicit way: Anyone who acts against us is a potential target. There is no immunity for anyone,” Gallant said. Here are some of the flash points across the region: A   on Tuesday that bore all the hallmarks of a targeted killing by Israel. Saleh Arouri is the highest-ranking Hamas official killed since Oct. 7, when the Palestinian group led a cross-border attack into Israel that killed 1,200. Israeli officials have warned that they would target Hamas officials living internationally, though they have not claimed direct responsibility for the killing of Arouri. The assassination comes amid long-running speculation that Hezbollah may join Hamas’s war against Israel. Since Oct. 7, the militant group has engaged in cross-border attacks on Israel, though it is generally considered to have held back from full hostilities. Arouri was killed in Dahieh, a residential neighborhood near Beirut that is considered a Hezbollah stronghold. Hasan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said   that there would be a “response and punishment” to the assassination of Arouri. Rym Momtaz, a fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that Hezbollah would likely face pressure from its supporters to respond, but that it also had to factor in Lebanon’s precarious economic situation. “A big part of the Lebanese population just cannot even fathom going through another war, given what they’re already going through right now,” Momtaz said, referring to a financial crisis in the country that has plunged  . An Iranian-linked militia commander was killed in Baghdad on Thursday in a  The target, Mushtaq Talib al-Saidi, was deputy commander of operations in the Baghdad region for the militia Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, according to a statement by the group. The militia had claimed responsibility for several attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq since Oct. 7 — part of a broader spate of recent attacks that aim to force the United States to end its presence in Iraq. Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba is part of a coalition of Iranian-backed groups known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) that worked with the Iraqi military to defeat the Islamic State after it took over much of the country in 2014. The militia officially falls under the command of the Iraqi army. In a statement Thursday, Iraqi military spokesman Yahya Rasool   were responsible for an “unwarranted attack on an Iraqi security entity” that amounted to “blatant aggression and violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and security.” Roughly 2,500 U.S. personnel are based in Iraq at present, with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani saying that their presence is needed to help stop the Islamic State from regaining ground. PMF militias have been behind over 100 attacks on U.S. forces in the country since Oct. 17, according to U.S. counts, marking a significant escalation and resulting in rounds of retaliation. Israel has repeatedly hit Syria since Oct. 7, with the Israel Defense Forces on Tuesday announcing that it had hit “military infrastructure belonging to the Syrian Army” in response to missile launches toward its territory. In late December, Iranian state media reported that Seyed Razi Mousavi, a senior official with the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, had been killed in a strike in the Sayeda Zeinab neighborhood of Damascus. In accounts of his death, Mousavi  , the Iranian military leader who has garnered a status as a martyr since his killing by the United States. Soleimani had led the Quds Force, the arm of the Revolutionary Guard that worked internationally. Randa Slim, director of the Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program at the Middle East Institute, said the death of Mousavi was a more significant blow than Arouri for Hezbollah and Iran. Iranian officials pledged to retaliate for Mousavi’s death, with Hossein Akbari, Iran’s ambassador to Syria, saying that Israel would get a “response to this crime at the right time and the right situation.”  have staged numerous attacks on merchant ships passing the Red Sea. On Wednesday, they claimed an attack on a Malta-flagged ship they said was heading for Israel. The regular attacks on the key trade route have led some major shipping companies to avoid the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a slim waterway near the area controlled by the Iranian-backed militant group in Yemen. In response to the economic disruption, the United States and its allies formed a multinational initiative dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian. U.S. Navy ships have engaged with Houthi forces, sinking three boats in one exchange on Sunday, according to the Pentagon. In a statement posted to social media Tuesday, the Houthis warned that “any American aggression will not go unanswered.” The Houthis have also fired longer-range missiles at Israel since Oct. 7, claiming they will keep targeting Israel until “Israeli aggression stops.” Most missiles have been intercepted by Israeli air defenses. Since seizing control of Yemen’s capital in 2014, the Houthis have become one of Iran’s most capable allies in the region and among the most independent. Analysts say that by disrupting shipping in support of Hamas, they are both appealing to their domestic supporters and establishing themselves as peers to more established groups like Hezbollah. Iran was also touched by violence on its soil this week, as twin blasts in the central city of Kerman on Wednesday killed at least 95 people who had been visiting Soleimani’s birthplace to commemorate his death. The attack was not linked to Israel or the United States, but another key regional foe: the Islamic State, which claimed the blasts in a message posted to social media on Thursday. “ISIS hates Iran more than Israel hates Iran, if such a thing is possible,” said Hiltermann, using an acronym to refer to the extremist group. So far, Israel has not struck Iran directly since Oct. 7, though Israeli officials have suggested they would do it if the conflict expands. Analysts say, however, that Iran is unlikely to back down from its support for Hamas and other regional allies. “Any such event by itself wouldn’t lead to war. But the more these assassinations accumulate, the more they start happening one after another, the more you move toward a trigger where somebody says, to hell with it,” said Slim, of the Middle East Institute. “Then, we’ve got a large war on our hands.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2H32XYOCIZHSPLSRKO6WTSQIWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2H32XYOCIZHSPLSRKO6WTSQIWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2H32XYOCIZHSPLSRKO6WTSQIWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2H32XYOCIZHSPLSRKO6WTSQIWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2H32XYOCIZHSPLSRKO6WTSQIWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2H32XYOCIZHSPLSRKO6WTSQIWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/04/middle-east-israel-gaza-war-iran-syria/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 18:12:00,
"The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide whether former President Donald Trump’s name can appear on primary-election ballots, a case that ensures the justices will play a central role in shaping this year’s presidential election. The decision to review the case from Colorado at oral argument in early February comes after that   before and during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Supreme Court said Friday it will decide whether former President Donald Trump’s name can appear on primary-election ballots, a case that ensures the justices will play a central role in shaping this year’s presidential election. The decision to review the case from Colorado at oral argument in early February comes after that   before and during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Friday’s announcement puts the justices in a pivotal, potentially uncomfortable position with echoes of the court’s involvement in the 2000 election when its decision assured victory for President George W. Bush, polarized the nation and damaged the court’s reputation as an independent institution. The court’s brief order scheduled oral argument for Feb. 8, and came the day before the third anniversary of the Capitol riot. Legal scholars and state election officials have urged the court to quickly settle the question of Trump’s eligibility as a candidate and to ensure all states follow the same policy ahead of this year’s primary voting. Trump holds a wide lead over other Republican contenders, with the Iowa caucus less than two weeks away and state primaries starting Jan. 23. The Colorado decision was the first time a court found a presidential candidate could be barred from the ballot because of a provision of the post-Civil War 14th Amendment.   and was designed to keep Confederates from returning to power. Similar arguments have been made to keep Trump off the ballot elsewhere. While those challenges have failed in some states, like Michigan and Minnesota, they are pending in Illinois, Oregon, Massachusetts and elsewhere. Maine’s   Trump from that state’s ballot, an order   in state court. Both Colorado and Maine temporarily put their decisions to bar Trump as a candidate on hold, meaning the former president’s name will stay on the primary ballots until the legal issues are resolved. Colorado and Maine hold primaries on March 5, but ballots are printed — and mailed to military and overseas voters — weeks before then. The public already views the Supreme Court through a partisan lens, with Democrats expressing little confidence in the court and Republicans saying the opposite, and the question of whether Trump should be kept off the ballot has the potential to further polarize those views. “It throws them right into the political thicket,” Stanford law professor Michael W. McConnell said of the court. “There is no way they can decide the case without having about half the country think they are being partisan hacks.” In part for that reason, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., an ardent institutionalist, is likely to look for consensus through a narrow ruling that seeks unanimity or avoids a partisan split on a court with a 6-3 conservative majority that includes three justices nominated by Trump. Constitutional   to bar Trump from the ballot, or whether such a move, even if legally sound, is politically too dangerous. Many of them say they expect the justices to try to find a way to decide the case without addressing the underlying question of whether Trump engaged in insurrection. The justices have several paths to resolve the case in a way that keeps Trump’s name on the ballot without dealing with the question of insurrection. In urging the justices to invalidate the Colorado decision, and give voters the opportunity to select the candidate of their choosing, the former president’s lawyers and the Colorado Republican Party have made multiple arguments. States, they say, have no authority to enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment without the passage of federal legislation. They also contend that Section 3 applies to those who took oaths to serve in Congress or a state legislature, but not to serve as president. In addition, Trump’s lawyers say he did not engage in an insurrection. If a majority of justices agree with Trump on any one of those arguments, the court could allow the former president’s name to remain on the ballot. Attorneys for the six Colorado voters who challenged Trump’s eligibility have said the Constitution’s language barring insurrectionists from office is clear; that it applies to presidents; and does not require an act of Congress to be enforced. They urged the justices in a filing Thursday to abide by the finding from Colorado’s top court that the former president intentionally incited his supporters to violence on Jan. 6, 2021, to disrupt the certification of the election — and exacerbated the attack while it was ongoing.

"A judge in Johnson County, Kan., on Wednesday   prosecutors’ motion to dismiss three felony charges against Jackson Mahomes, the younger brother of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In May,   Jackson Mahomes with three felony counts of aggravated sexual battery after a February incident at a restaurant and bar in Overland Park, Kan. A judge in Johnson County, Kan., on Wednesday   prosecutors’ motion to dismiss three felony charges against Jackson Mahomes, the younger brother of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In May,   Jackson Mahomes with three felony counts of aggravated sexual battery after a February incident at a restaurant and bar in Overland Park, Kan. Surveillance video of the incident that appeared online seems to show Mahomes grabbing the 40-year-old restaurant owner by the neck and forcibly kissing her. But according to prosecutors’  , the alleged victim — unnamed by prosecutors — signed an affidavit in November saying she would not testify in the case. She also told prosecutors that if they granted her immunity and compelled her to testify, “she would say that she had not been truthful to the police and that the encounter with the defendant was consensual.” But because of the evidence in their possession, including the surveillance footage, prosecutors proceeded with the case and attempted to subpoena the alleged victim to testify, granting her immunity. But the woman has not been served with the subpoena because — according to conversations “with more than one person in contact with her” — she “is actively thwarting attempts to serve her to avoid coming to court,” prosecutors wrote in their motion to dismiss. The alleged victim “has made her lack of cooperation abundantly clear,” prosecutors wrote. The February incident began when Mahomes allegedly shoved one of the restaurant’s employees. Prosecutors charged him with misdemeanor battery over that portion of the incident, and he was arraigned on that charge Wednesday. “Like I said from the beginning, Jackson has done nothing wrong,” Brandan Davies, Mahomes’s attorney,   in a statement Tuesday. “We had full confidence that the truth of the matter would ultimately be revealed. The defense will reserve further comment until the remaining count is disposed of.” , Davies told the court Wednesday that he would not seek diversion for the misdemeanor charge and requested that the case go to trial, which is slated to begin March 25. According to  , police were called to the restaurant Feb. 25 by the father of the worker who allegedly had been shoved by Mahomes. The restaurant owner told police she had taken Mahomes to her office, where he grabbed her by the neck and forcibly kissed her without her consent. “And out of nowhere, he just grabbed me by the neck and, like, forcefully kissed me and then proceeded to do it two more times, where the last time I was pushing him off,” the owner   in an interview last year with the Kansas City Star. In   with Fox 4, the restaurant owner said she wouldn’t have called police about the incident and that she and her restaurant had been targeted in the months that followed, losing 75 percent of its business. “We’ve had gas pipes cut. We’ve had the AC pipes cut from the outside, you know — you name it, it’s pretty much happened,” she said. In August, the Star   the restaurant had closed until another tenant could be found.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A6KPSVBBKIZDNSNUE5FOT45Z6A.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A6KPSVBBKIZDNSNUE5FOT45Z6A.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A6KPSVBBKIZDNSNUE5FOT45Z6A.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A6KPSVBBKIZDNSNUE5FOT45Z6A.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A6KPSVBBKIZDNSNUE5FOT45Z6A.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A6KPSVBBKIZDNSNUE5FOT45Z6A.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/jackson-mahomes-charges-dismissed/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 15:10:00,
"Alexandria City sophomore Darius Bivins knows his game has flash — a dazzling handle, a knack for no-look passes — but the 5-foot-11 guard believes opponents tend to forget about his defense. In the final minute of Thursday night’s 55-52 win at West Potomac in Alexandria, he used that to his advantage. Alexandria City sophomore Darius Bivins knows his game has flash — a dazzling handle, a knack for no-look passes — but the 5-foot-11 guard believes opponents tend to forget about his defense. In the final minute of Thursday night’s 55-52 win at West Potomac in Alexandria, he used that to his advantage. With his team up two, Bivins waited for the Wolverines to pick on him in an isolation set — then he got low and reached around a spinning West Potomac ballhandler for a clean strip to protect the Titans’ lead. Next possession, with Alexandria City ahead by three after a free throw, West Potomac identified Bivins in the paint and drove right back at him. He stripped it again. “I’ve always gotten a lot of steals ever since I was young,” Bivins said. “When I come out here, it’s just like I’m at open gym playing with adults. I’ve started to time people. It’s kind of easy now. I knew what move he was going to do.” Last season, the Titans boasted one of the state’s top pairings in  . Kullen’s graduation thrust Bivins into a larger role, steering the team as a facilitator while Kye Robinson handles much of the scoring. On Thursday, Robinson scored his 1,000th point and finished with a team-high 24 points. “It’s been real fun. We’ve always just been around each other. From the day we met, it was a bond,” Bivins said. “He’s giving you the censored version,” Robinson chimed in. “We hated each other at first. But competition fueled us, and we bonded really closely after that.” Thursday was the first of what is likely to be many competitive tests remaining for the   Titans; local coaches generally see the Patriot District as the deepest in Northern Virginia. West Potomac (8-4), the district tournament champion last winter, and Alexandria City (8-2), the reigning regular season champ, are two of the front-runners. The teams jockeyed throughout. The Wolverines, whose previous two games included six overtimes, built an early lead by willingly taking charges and attacking the offensive boards. But Alexandria City, playing off a late surge by Robinson that included two and-ones, took a one-point edge into halftime. The Titans’ lead ballooned to 10 late in the third quarter, but West Potomac cut its deficit back to one at the end of the third quarter and led by six with 2:30 left after back-to-back three-pointers. Those would be the Wolverines’ final field goals, though, as the Titans clamped down and then went back to their trusty duo to retake the lead. The sequence that they used to overtake West Potomac: Robinson basket, Bivins basket, Bivins basket and two Robinson free throws. “We’ve been ready for this moment,” Bivins said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EWBSER5NFAKNMV25DRFEFBR2A_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EWBSER5NFAKNMV25DRFEFBR2A_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EWBSER5NFAKNMV25DRFEFBR2A_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EWBSER5NFAKNMV25DRFEFBR2A_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EWBSER5NFAKNMV25DRFEFBR2A_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EWBSER5NFAKNMV25DRFEFBR2A_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/alexandria-city-west-potomac-boys-basketball/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 22:50:00,

NEW ORLEANS — When it was finally over at the Superdome, when No. 2 Washington had held on to beat No. 3 Texas, 37-31, in the Sugar Bowl, a bit of fruit hung so low that it damn near scraped the floor: By advancing to next Monday’s College Football Playoff national championship game in Houston, Washington made sure the game would double as a preview of the Big Ten’s future, the Huskies set to face No. 1 Michigan for the title. Thank realignment and Michael Penix Jr. Penix, the Huskies’ super senior quarterback, finished a stunning 29 for 38 for 430 yards and two touchdowns. After an unlikely sequence of events, Texas drove to the Washington 13-yard line for the final play of the game, but its throw to the end zone as time expired was knocked incomplete. Penix and the Huskies had done enough for a 14-0 record, for a chance at the perfect ending to a perfect season. Through two quarters, the score was tied 21-21 because of Penix’s arm and Quinn Ewers’s legs. For Washington, Penix fit passes into windows big and shrinking, throwing for 255 yards by halftime, completing 11 of his 14 attempts. For Texas, Ewers was 9 for 18 on his way to 24 for 43, his accuracy much more shaky. But he ran when he had to — when Washington’s defense offered the opportunity — and ripped off a 21-yard scramble to set up the Longhorns’ third score with a minute left in the second. The whole beginning promised a shootout until the end. Texas, only slowed by six first-half penalties, gashed the Huskies on the ground. Penix couldn’t miss deep, countering Texas’s pass rush with quick feet and even quicker decision-making. Then, 4:30 into the third quarter, Penix pushed the Huskies ahead 28-21 with a 19-yard dart to Jalen McMillan over the middle. Then Washington’s defense recovered a fumble, setting up another well-placed throw from Penix, which set up a 26-yard field goal to pad the lead. Every time a pass left Penix’s left hand, Texas’s margin for error got smaller and smaller. And in the end, after the Longhorns lost a second fumble, they trailed by 13 points with 11 minutes left. They cut it to six with 7:23 remaining. But Penix brought the Huskies right back down the field, setting up a chip-shot field goal that helped them weather the major scare in the final minute. Nothing is ever easy at this time of year.

When the Nets   for their next game, the four absent players all returned to the lineup, and Bridges, O’Neale and Thomas each logged more playing time than they had against the Bucks. “Following an investigation, including review by an independent physician, the NBA determined that four Nets rotation players, who did not participate in the game, could have played under the medical standard in the Player Participation Policy,”  . The Nets became the first team to be fined under the player participation policy, which was implemented before this season as part of   play. The policy requires healthy star players to appear in nationally televised games, prevents teams from resting multiple players during the same game and bans long-term shutdowns of healthy players at the end of the season, among other stipulations. Nets Coach Jacque Vaughn   that he would field a shorthanded lineup because of “executive decisions,” noting that his team was “banged up,” dealing with “nagging injuries” and had battled undisclosed “sicknesses” during a recent road trip. Vaughn also noted that Bridges had an ironman streak of more than 400 games played to maintain, which helped explain why he played a reduced role against Milwaukee rather than sitting out. Bridges, for his part,   he was “healthy” and wanted to play his standard role and didn’t want to “just sub in, get the streak and whatever.” Brooklyn’s motivation for resting its players was fairly obvious: The Nets had  , who were in the midst of  , and they had to travel before playing the second game of a stretch that included three games in four nights and led into an extended road trip. Mired in a losing stretch that dates back to mid-December, the Nets rested their players against the Bucks, effectively punting the game against the Eastern Conference’s second-place team. The strategy didn’t produce immediate dividends: The Nets (15-20) lost to the Wizards two nights later and are riding a five-game losing streak entering their next game Friday. NBA executives held face-to-face meetings with team executives before the season to discuss the mechanics of the player participation policy, which sought to curb “load management” and enabled the league to independently investigate resting decisions and fine teams $100,000 for the first offense, $250,000 for the second offense and $1 million for each offense after that. “What we’re talking about is the culture of this league,” NBA executive vice president of basketball operations  . “We are really emphasizing that this is an 82-game season, an 82-game league. It’s not a 50-game or 60-game league. ... Slowly, over time, you see all this slippage in missing games in the regular season and the All-Star Game devolving into what it did this year.

United to become its head coach, people close to the matter said Tuesday. Lesesne, 40, will replace Wayne Rooney,  . United officials said they did not want to comment. Lesesne could not be immediately reached for comment. Lesesne (pronounced Le-sane) agreed to a three-year guaranteed contract, said one person close to the team, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the deal. Lesesne will become United’s third full-time head coach since  . Initially hired by the Red Bulls as an assistant in 2022, Lesesne received wide praise for recalibrating the team last season following Gerhard Struber’s dismissal two months into the campaign. He posted a 10-9-4 record, including three victories to end MLS’s regular season, then oversaw a first-round playoff victory against Charlotte. Across all competitions, he had a 14-10-8 mark. The Red Bulls  . Before joining the Red Bulls, he coached second-division New Mexico United for three years. He was also an assistant at second-tier clubs in Charleston, S.C., and Charlotte. Lesesne’s hiring came the same day Rooney was fired by Birmingham City, the English club he joined after leaving Washington. His low-key background comes in stark contrast to Rooney’s when United hired him in the summer of 2022. The English former superstar rejuvenated interest in the organization but failed to lead the team to a playoff berth. United has missed the playoffs four consecutive years and hasn’t won a postseason game since 2015. Last season, United faded down the stretch and finished 10-14-10,  . Lesesne’s hiring brings another young element into the upper levels of United’s technical staff. In November, 37-year-old  and became one of the youngest decision-makers in the league. Mackay’s coaching search included former MLS coaches Robin Fraser, Domènec Torrent and Caleb Porter (who was hired recently by the New England Revolution);  ; and former Salvadoran national team coach Hugo Pérez. According to two people, Mackay also spoke informally with Bruce Arena, the most successful coach in U.S. pro soccer history whose tenure at New England   amid an MLS investigation of inappropriate remarks in the workplace. The final candidates were Lesesne, Fraser, Torrent and Pérez, one person said. Torrent, 61, seemed well-positioned for the job after serving as chief assistant under famed coach Pep Guardiola at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City. In 2019, he guided NYCFC to its finest regular season in history before taking jobs with Flamengo (Brazil) and Galatasaray (Turkey). It was unclear, though, whether United could have met his salary demands. D.C. and Montreal were the last MLS teams seeking a head coach following a volatile year of coaching changes around the league. Montreal has yet to announce its choice. United’s interest in Lesesne was first reported by The Washington Post last month. The Athletic was first to report Tuesday that United was in talks to hire him. United’s move for Lesesne, a South Carolina native, comes less than two weeks before it is scheduled to open training camp in Leesburg.

"A group of state legislators and children’s safety advocates are planning a renewed campaign to import British digital safeguards for kids into the United States as they look to ward off legal challenges from the tech industry. After California   — styled after child protection rules in the United Kingdom — lawmakers in several other states,  , introduced their own versions. A group of state legislators and children’s safety advocates are planning a renewed campaign to import British digital safeguards for kids into the United States as they look to ward off legal challenges from the tech industry. After California   — styled after child protection rules in the United Kingdom — lawmakers in several other states,  , introduced their own versions. The law, known as the  , requires digital services to “prioritize” the well-being of children when developing products and vet those tools for potential risks before rolling them out. California’s legislature passed the measure unanimously, a sign of the growing political consensus over ways social media platforms and other sites may expose children to harmful content and may manipulate them through product features. But the campaign was dealt a major blow in September when a   and   probably does “not pass constitutional muster.” That case, which is still pending, could ultimately decide the fate of similar bills nationwide. A separate group of state child safety laws requiring platforms to vet users’ ages and attain parental consent to let teens access their sites  . Legislators and advocates are forging ahead, however, reviving efforts to get the U.K.-style protections into law while attempting to thwart industry criticism that the approach would expand data collection and impose ambiguous restrictions on businesses, according to interviews with key negotiators and documents obtained by The Washington Post. “A judge’s ruling is not going to stop us from advancing things that can protect young people in our state,” said Maryland Del. Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), a sponsor of the proposal in that state. Nichole Rocha, head of U.S. affairs for the 5Rights Foundation, a London-based nonprofit that advocates digital safety principles for children, said the proposals would usher in a “complete paradigm shift” for children’s online safety. “Instead of the internet being designed for adults, the default would be that it’s designed in a safe manner where children and teens can be online and freely access content and services without looming risks of harm,” said Rocha, whose group is . The founder of 5Rights is Beeban Kidron, a British baroness who is pushing for U.S. legislators to replicate  . The tech trade association NetChoice, whose   led to the halting of the California law,   that the law violates the First Amendment by restricting speech. NetChoice also has argued the law is “unconstitutionally vague” in describing what constitutes the “best interests of children” and would force companies to engage in “invasive data collection” by requiring them to estimate the ages of users. NetChoice counts tech companies including Meta, Google and Amazon as members. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Post.) In the California ruling, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman largely sidestepped the group’s criticisms that the law is too vague, but she found that NetChoice was likely to succeed in showing the law regulates protected speech and violates the First Amendment. The federal judge also found that the law’s requirement that platforms estimate the age of children on their services was “likely to exacerbate” concerns around children’s privacy rather than help prevent harm. Proponents have pushed back on the judge’s assertion that the law probably infringes on free speech, arguing that it only affects the choices companies make when designing their products and thus targets conduct, not speech. Rocha said the ruling could set a “dangerous precedent” that any safety requirements would curtail free expression. Still, she said, advocates and state lawmakers are working on changes to their bills in other states to make the legislation “stronger against illegal attack” while they await a final verdict in the California case. Those changes include expanding on key definitions and tightening the assessment requirements to tackle the court’s concerns about the law’s enforceability. Meetali Jain, director of the Tech Justice Law Project advocacy group, said the updates “primarily clarify definitions and address so-called vagueness that some critiqued” in the California law, including by more clearly defining what is in the best interests of a child. According to draft proposals obtained by The Post, state officials in Minnesota, Maryland and New Mexico are considering fresh language that would require companies to consider whether their products could lead to “reasonably foreseeable” physical, psychological or financial harm to a child, as well as discrimination. Legislators are also considering stripping age estimation requirements from the measures, while further specifying that the restrictions apply only to digital services that are “reasonably” likely to be accessed by children. The change, which leans on concepts common in tort law, could address some of the concerns Freeman raised. “Lawmakers are quickly realizing that age verification for those under 18 means massive data collection on everyone, including those over 18,” said Carl Szabo, NetChoice’s vice president and general counsel. Some of the updated drafts include new provisions specifying that if part of the bill is blocked or rejected in court, the rest would still stand, otherwise known as a severability clause. In the California case, NetChoice has argued that if any of the law’s provisions are struck down, the entire measure should be legally void. Some of the proposed changes are still in flux. States including Minnesota have considered shifting the timing of their safety requirements so that companies no longer have to conduct risk assessments before products launch, according to the drafts. But Minnesota state Rep. Kristin Bahner (D), who is leading the state’s effort, said she intends to forge ahead with the existing requirement before products are rolled out. “Frankly, telling someone to do an impact assessment after they’ve already created the product doesn’t make good business sense,” said Bahner, who has worked as an IT consultant. While state officials outside California are still tweaking their proposals to head off criticisms about the protections, the future of the campaign may ultimately rest on whether the courts find that the overarching approach is constitutional. “How the courts decide what is First Amendment-protected … is still undecided, but it’s our hope that when it comes to the fundamental design of products … the design of digital products and services should be fair game,” Jain said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2FYUASQI6XFOA6S52EQ6C7QA_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2FYUASQI6XFOA6S52EQ6C7QA_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2FYUASQI6XFOA6S52EQ6C7QA_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2FYUASQI6XFOA6S52EQ6C7QA_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2FYUASQI6XFOA6S52EQ6C7QA_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ID2FYUASQI6XFOA6S52EQ6C7QA_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/02/children-safety-social-media-california/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 08:00:00,

All you had to do was massage his rapacious ego by listening to one of his long-winded podcast interviews or reading one of his  , and somewhere in all that cascading twaddle, you discovered an opinion that aligned with yours. Black people, you once thought you had found that rare White quarterback honest enough to express the obvious in how NFL owners  . Nerds at heart and fun-loving weirdos, you tripped over yourselves in unearthing similarities with the most popular athlete in America’s most popular game, a real-life jock invited to sit at your lunch table who also had a passion for  , “Halo 3,” “ ” and the  Libertarians, you believed you had a peer who happened to star in an egalitarian game for a living but also thumbed through   and raged against governmental overreach, especially as it related to personal freedoms. Religious “ ,” in a league saturated with Christian evangelical overtones, you related with football’s secular maverick, whose life motto is to “question everything.” And Everybody Else Everywhere, you thought you could get behind this A-list celebrity who had a beating heart for   and for  . A rich and famous guy but a well-meaning human being just like the rest of us. Over the past several years, Rodgers has offered himself as a champion of both counterculture ideals and conventional wisdom. Appearing as if he had that special ability to be a friend to marginalized groups that could use an established name as a more accepted voice over their megaphones. But be careful of the allies you choose because a man sequestered on an island where only his own opinion matters can never stand as anyone’s advocate. These days, when Rodgers wakes up in the morning with that weaselly smirk on his face, he seems intent on fanning more chaos into the world. His message no longer connects with the general population — or at least the demographic of sports fans who will tune in to “The Pat McAfee Show” for some low-consequence entertainment. Instead, Rodgers has chosen the side that would rather criminalize the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert and casually accuse a late-night talk show host of being linked to sex trafficking. During his weekly   on Tuesday, a show sidekick teed up Rodgers to say something inflammatory regarding a list of associates tied to Jeffrey Epstein, and  . “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, really hoping that doesn’t come out,” Rodgers said, dropping Kimmel’s name from out of nowhere. It’s a sad commentary on our world that anyone can say anything about a person — just throwing unsubstantiated nonsense against the wall — and someone somewhere will actually believe it. Yet it’s even more jarring when that loose-lipped accuser used to speak with the recognition that his platform came with a certain responsibility. In 2016, Rodgers made an appearance on comedian Pete Holmes’s podcast   and in that nearly two-hour conversation, the topics ranged from the existence of UFOs to gluten-free soap, whether God also loves the team that loses,   and much, much more. Though he had won a Super Bowl, even as he lifted the Lombardi Trophy, he said, he questioned whether that was all there was to life. In the years that followed, he would turn inward, seeking a larger meaning. Although other men might allow a Super Bowl triumph to define them, not Rodgers. “Honestly, I think the root of it is this: You get to a point where I think you just desire to be looked at as more than just what you’re known for. Trying to change the narrative a little bit. When they think about you, what’s the first thing they think about?” Rodgers told Holmes, and went on to say: “I just believe that there’s more going on in what we see and there’s more going on in what we’re told and there’s more going on in what we know. And that hope for me [spurs] me on to use my influence in better ways, to connect more with people, to love better, to judge less, so that works for me.” Contrast those words to his Tuesday appearance with McAfee: “We’ve got to take back our country from these f---ing monsters,” Rodgers said. He has become a crusader for his own fringe beliefs, such a far cry from someone who at least had been a provocateur with a purpose. Though his support for Kaepernick in 2017 could have been more substantive, at least he was the White man who actually got it, understanding how critics focused solely on the method of Black NFL player protests (taking a knee) but overlooked the reasons behind them. Rodgers was the representative from the other side who stepped up and said something. He was an ally. Now it’s hard to imagine Rodgers as anything but a man unmoored in his mission. Rodgers finds it appealing to make people uncomfortable. Which explains why he will show up to McAfee’s show, a format that intends to mimic the bro vibes of a locker room, and announce with glee: “Fauci’s a criminal!” It’s stunning to watch Rodgers’s spiral into polarization, especially when McAfee, just by being relatable, has created a brand in retirement that dwarfs his NFL career and when the Mannings, Peyton and Eli, can dominate media without fatiguing the public. Instead of building a bridge that would connect his playing career to a lucrative life in the mainstream after retiring, Rodgers would rather wall himself behind conspiracy theories and retreat into the darkness of his own warped beliefs. He no longer sides with the masses who thought they had found a likable companion inside the mighty NFL. He no longer represents you — us. And maybe he never did.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WK4PEMDSYBIGXT2HXCUMZWXS4Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WK4PEMDSYBIGXT2HXCUMZWXS4Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WK4PEMDSYBIGXT2HXCUMZWXS4Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WK4PEMDSYBIGXT2HXCUMZWXS4Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WK4PEMDSYBIGXT2HXCUMZWXS4Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WK4PEMDSYBIGXT2HXCUMZWXS4Q_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/aaron-rodgers-kimmel-pat-mcafee/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 12:37:00,

Stores in France, Italy, Belgium and Spain will be affected, multiple news outlets reported. Carrefour, which has more than 12,000 stores globally, did not immediately respond to The Washington Post’s request for comment. In a sign taped to certain aisles in stores, the company announced the decision and said it is “committed to lowering prices.” A spokesperson for PepsiCo told The Post that the company has “been in discussion with Carrefour for many months and we will continue to engage in good faith to try to ensure that our products are available.” The move from Carrefour comes as Europeans continue to battle with high food prices. In France, food prices rose more than 7 percent year-over-year in December. Price increases peaked in March 2023, surging almost 16 percent, according to  . Retailers in the United States have also  to lower food prices. To apply pressure, some stores will put brands in the “penalty box,” said Randall Sargent, a partner in the retail and consumer goods division of the marketing consulting firm Oliver Wyman. That could mean unfavorable placement on shelves, less promotion and higher prices, making the products “less attractive for consumers to buy that brand relative to another brand,” she said. But in Europe, more aggressive tactics such as pulling all products is not uncommon, Sargent said. Grocery stores in the region are smaller, leaving less-noticeable holes on shelves, and European consumers are already more inclined to buy stores’ own private brands, she said. “While consumers are still very loyal to certain national brands, it’s a bit less disruptive when they’re pulled from the shelf because they’re already used to, and more willing in many categories, to shift to the private brand equivalent,” Sargent said. Carrefour expects to grow its private label, according to a strategic plan published in 2022. The company aims to have its private label represent 40 percent of food sales in 2026 — up from 33 percent in 2022. PepsiCo’s business in Europe accounts for about 14 percent of its global revenue, amounting at about $9 billion, the Wall Street Journal  . Given Carrefour’s size and scale in the region, lost presence on shelves “will definitely hurt the suppliers’ business in Europe, if not globally,” Sargent said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSX4VANRHQQYAXVSX7JDKTS5O4.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSX4VANRHQQYAXVSX7JDKTS5O4.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSX4VANRHQQYAXVSX7JDKTS5O4.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSX4VANRHQQYAXVSX7JDKTS5O4.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSX4VANRHQQYAXVSX7JDKTS5O4.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSX4VANRHQQYAXVSX7JDKTS5O4.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/04/pepsi-lays-carrefour-grocery/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 19:35:00,

He is trying to pinpoint the moment he knew he would have to step down as basketball coach of St. John’s, the private high school located a few minutes from this apartment in Northwest Washington. Officially, Behan  . But the realization came sooner. This keyboard in front of him, it can read his mind in a way. It tracks his eye movements, using them to type words and sentences and then dictate in a synthesized voice that sounds like his own. The technology is popular among people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the progressive nervous system disease that  . Last winter, as Behan’s story became widely known, it grew into a basketball fairy tale, as the Cadets marched to a Washington Catholic Athletic Conference championship. Memories of that season remain vibrant as the coach’s illness progresses. Meanwhile, with the WCAC slate beginning in earnest this week, St, John’s has an interim coach and stars from its title team scattered across the country. As Behan scans, the only noise inside his apartment is the rhythmic whir of the ventilator by his side. It keeps time in the quiet, pumping air through the tracheostomy tube connected to his throat. Breathing, just like speaking, is now beyond his control. He sits in a recliner chair, a wall of televisions in front of him. There are six of them, in two rows, to provide as much escape as possible. He has always been a sports fanatic, and that has been especially true in sickness. From his chair he watches an endless stream of baseball, college football and golf. Now that its basketball season, he follows the college careers of his former players. On this Monday night in late December, only one TV is on. The 6 p.m. edition of SportsCenter plays on mute, illuminating the dark room. In the corner sits a tree covered in ornaments and topped by a big red crab in place of a star. Christmas is a week away. “I probably knew around the team banquet in early May,” Behan says after a few minutes. “Which, ironically enough, is pretty much the time that I found out I had ALS the year before.” One year. After being diagnosed with ALS at age 34, Behan got one year to coach basketball. Those months were busy and long: Countless trips to Boston for treatment; a full basketball season; public appearances to raise awareness and money through the  . The schedule was never open and energy never came easy. But on the court, everything fell into place. St. John’s had three stars, a selfless supporting cast, a dedicated coaching staff and something — someone — to play for. The Cadets went 32-4, culminating in an dramatic  in the WCAC championship. That game will be talked about in this region for a long time. “I was proud of the way everything connected together,” Behan says. “They showed me the true meaning of embracing roles.” But when the season was over, and there were no more games to play, a different reality set in. All great high school teams are defeated by time, bulldozed by the cyclical nature of the scholastic game. That championship-winning St. John’s team — memorable in so many ways — was gone in one offseason. Donnie Freeman stepped out of the makeshift locker room assigned to his team in the back halls of DeMatha, ducking his 6-foot-9 frame through the doorway in a silver puffer jacket. Freeman knew his way around this gym, had played plenty of games as a visitor on its red and blue floor. But in the minutes after IMG Academy’s 63-58 loss to Bullis on Dec. 10, Freeman was just waiting for his team to hit the road again. It was mid-August when Freeman announced he would be leaving St. John’s for IMG, cutting a celebrated Cadets career short of a victory lap. He moved to Bradenton, Fla., and returned to the area in December for the National High School Hoops Festival, an annual showcase in Hyattsville. The Syracuse commit played in the blue and white of IMG, scoring 12 points as his team was upset. “I had a lot of growing up to do,” Freeman said. “It’s been a good experience going off on my own and living on my own before college. But it’s an adjustment.” He had come to St. John’s as a skinny kid with immense potential. Pre-teen growth spurts made him  , the kind of fluid rim-protector coaches crave. He earned varsity minutes as a freshman and steadily developed into a star. By his junior year, he had two standout guards flanking him. Daquan Davis, a hard-nosed guard from Baltimore, joined the Cadets before the season. He transferred from St. Frances, looking for more exposure in a key period of the college recruitment process. He knew he wanted to play in the WCAC; he just had to choose a school. He had noticed Behan at many of his AAU games, the former power forward towering over the crowd. Davis picked St. John’s and hoped for the best. Malik Mack was in his fourth year on the Cadets, having worked his way back after missing his sophomore year with a torn ACL. By his senior season, he was an ideal veteran ball-handler — crafty and calm. Behan referred to him as the “heart and soul” of the team. In the WCAC tournament — an always-tense three-day obstacle course that determines the league’s outright champion — Mack, Davis and Freeman each had a defining moment. In the semifinal against Gonzaga, Freeman hit a deep three with 19 seconds left to give his team a one-point win. In the next day’s final against Paul VI, Mack paced the team with 15 points and eight assists, hitting a step-back three with under a minute left to put the Cadets up by one. And after a Panthers free throw tied the score, Davis beat his man and laid in the game-winner with 3.8 seconds remaining. “The chemistry was probably the main reason we were winning last year,” Mack said. “We had talent, but we maybe weren’t as talented as some other teams. … But everyone got along, everybody hung with each other off the court. It was a real brotherhood, and that’s what set us apart.” Mack is at Harvard now, starring as one of the best players in the Ivy League. In the first month with the Crimson, he averaged 20 points and was named conference freshman of the week three times. With three starters graduating and a potential coaching change coming, Davis and Freeman knew they were entering an offseason of uncertainty. Both players, having watched Behan’s health deteriorate, had a feeling their coach would not be able to return They had myriad options to leave St. John’s. In the early summer, Davis was approached by Overtime Elite,  that aims to give high school players an alternate pathway to the NBA. Players are offered a salary if they forego college ball, or a future scholarship if they still want to maintain their collegiate eligibility. Initially, Davis was not interested, but his family encouraged him to reconsider. He now spends his days training and playing games on the weekends as he weighs his college decision. For Freeman, if Behan was returning to St. John’s, he was returning, too. There was no doubt about that. But when the coach missed team activities in June, the four-star prospect considered the possibility he could spend his senior season elsewhere. In early July, he went to Georgia to take part in Peach Jam, the biggest event on the AAU calendar. That week, Behan was admitted to George Washington University Hospital with several complications from ALS, including pneumonia. The Behan Strong social media accounts posted updates, telling followers the coach was “fighting for his life.” At Peach Jam, Freeman was recruited hard. Considering the strong connection between St. John’s and IMG Academy — which is led by former Cadets coach Sean McAloon — the Ascenders initially abstained from the chase. But when Freeman and his family decided a transfer would be best, the Florida school seemed like a comfortable destination. Comfort is something all three players are seeking. Mack, Freeman and Davis have adjusted to new roles and new teammates, different goals and stakes. Basketball is still basketball, but it’s unclear if it will ever feel like it did last season. “From the managers to the coaches to the players and everyone in between, that team was just locked in,” Freeman said. “And to come out with a championship, knowing what it took for us to get to that point, it was surreal. You can’t really put words on a moment like that. I’ll remember it for the rest of my life.” Patrick O’Connor was named interim coach of St. John’s on Aug. 28, less than a week after Behan told The Post he would not return. The 31-year old is lively and earnest, a former Division III forward at Washington and Lee who came to the District after college for a teaching residency. He arrived at St. John’s in 2016, serving as the coach of the freshman team as well as a varsity assistant under McAloon. When McAloon left for IMG a year later, O’Connor asked around about the supposed successor, a former Cadets assistant who had turned around the St. Mary’s Ryken program in Southern Maryland. “Don’t worry,” a co-worker told him. “Behan is one of us.” Behan kept him on staff, and the pair grew close. “I had a really positive high school basketball experience, making some lifelong friends,” O’Connor said. “So I don’t want to be a college coach. I don’t want to be an NBA coach. I want to be a high school coach because I know it can be four of the most formative years of a young man’s life.” O’Connor inherited a Cadets team with no seniors and no returning starters. Outside of transfer Omari Witherspoon, the Cadets did not add any experienced talent as they seek to defend a title in one of the country’s toughest conferences. “We tell the kids phrases like ‘Be you’ and ‘Next is now,’ ” O’Connor said. “Those are just little things we say to them, but I’m also saying them to myself when I go home.” The coaching staff also looks different this winter: Artie Bryant, a longtime Cadets assistant, died in September, leaving a second painful void on the bench. For a team with so many new variables, St. John’s has fared well so far. They went 10-3 in December, handling opponents from far and wide as they proved a rebuilding WCAC team is often just as good as another league’s heavyweight. O’Connor remembers last season as a whirlwind. From the staples — practices, tournaments and scouting trips — to the little things unique to his relationship with Behan, like when Behan’s hands started to fail him and O’Connor would help map out plays on the whiteboard or hold a water bottle as the head coach drank. There was no thought to the bigger picture. There was only finding a way to move forward, one game to the next. When he thinks about the WCAC championship, he thinks about the final shot of the night. After Davis’s lay-in gave the Cadets a lead, Paul VI called timeout to plan a hopeful heave. It came from guard DeShawn Harris-Smith — the All-Met Player of the Year — and it looked good from the moment he released it. Three years before, the Cadets had lost a regular season game to Paul VI on a half-court shot. Behan and O’Connor obsessed over that loss for weeks, talking through the best ways to guard against that heartbreak. “Is this really going to happen again?” O’Connor asked himself when Harris-Smith released the ball. When the shot caromed off the back rim, O’Connor turned to Behan and hugged him, burying his face in the taller man’s shoulder. They stayed like that for some time, unmoving and surrounded by joy. “So many people had a hand in making last year a success, and I want to honor them by continuing that trajectory,” O’Connor said eight months after that night. “I want to make the school proud. And I want to make him proud, too.” Sitting at Behan’s bedside on that late-December night — and every other night — is his wife, Nataly. They have been together six years and got married in August. Last winter, she could, without fail, be found in the first row behind the St. John’s bench, her eyes darting between the action on the court and the coach on the sideline. It amazed her, what would happen to him while he was coaching. The passion he could summon, how different it was to the fatigue and pain she saw before and afterward. As the Cadets marched toward a title, those off-court moments grew more difficult. Behan’s form of ALS is familial, and several relatives, including his father, have died from it. From the moment he was diagnosed, he knew the passage of time would be his adversary. At the start of the season, Behan’s main issue was fatigue. As the Cadets worked their way through conference play, more problems arose. His breathing became more labored, his hands functioned less. By playoff time, Nataly could detect a slur in his speech. “But in the spring, that’s when everything got worse — from swallowing to his voice to breathing,” she said. Away from the spotlight of the basketball season, the struggle became more intimate as it grew more difficult. The first major scare came in early July with the lengthy hospital stay. That’s when doctors mentioned switching from a BiPap mask — which helps push air into his lungs — to the ventilator. He returned to the hospital in late October, staying for 18 days as he battled two pneumonia infections. Toward the end of that visit, the home ventilator was installed. “I had to learn every single thing about it,” Nataly said. “I remember thinking ‘Am I going to be able to do this?’ The vent is my responsibility, even with the caretakers that are with us. So when I leave the house, I only ever go within a mile radius. I want to make sure I can get back here.” The ventilator represented another responsibility and also more money. Over the last year and a half, the couple has dealt with the exorbitant costs of serious illness. Donations, collected on the  and a  , are integral to his wellbeing. In addition, the ventilator made any kind of travel more laborious. He has attended two St. John’s home games this season, a five-minute drive that requires of hours of preparation. “People see him and say that he looks good. And he does,” Nataly said. “But it takes my whole family helping me out — eight of us — to get him ready. It’s a whole process. We want to make sure he’s safe. And that’s a lot.” On Wednesday, Behan was courtside for the second annual Behan Strong Invitational, a three-game showcase to raise awareness and funds to benefit his care. At last year’s event, Behan led his team to a thrilling win over IMG, the first real sign that the Cadets had championship potential. This year, he entered Gallagher gymnasium just before the second game of the night, planting his wheelchair in the corner next to the St. John’s bench. He received an ovation from the crowd, and as the starters were announced for Bullis and Jacks0n-Reed, each player ran over to greet him. Unable to extend his hand for a high-five, Behan would stick his foot out for each player to tap: A gesture, as much as he could muster, of encouragement and thanks. Being back in the gym reminded him of the joys of last year. Of all the games Behan has watched from his recliner the past few months, that championship game is not one of them. “It’s funny, I haven’t in a very long time,” he said. “But I had an urge the other day.” When he does, he will see many of the sequences that already exist on a playback in his mind: Malik’s three-pointer, Daquan’s final drive, the buzzer-beater that didn’t go. What he won’t see on the film is the part of that night he thinks about most. After O’Connor releases him from the hug, Behan is mobbed by more well-wishers. Nataly is there, crying happy tears. His friend Glenn Farello, coach of Paul VI, comes to shake his hand. There are TV cameras and students and sweaty players everywhere. It is a joyous mess. At some point, a chair is fetched. Behan sits there for some time, surrounded by his school community. A reporter asks him how he’s feeling. “It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Behan says, exhausted and elated. “But it will. I just don’t know when.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SAKE35CDDFBHBA5M6OA5D4R3A_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SAKE35CDDFBHBA5M6OA5D4R3A_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SAKE35CDDFBHBA5M6OA5D4R3A_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SAKE35CDDFBHBA5M6OA5D4R3A_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SAKE35CDDFBHBA5M6OA5D4R3A_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SAKE35CDDFBHBA5M6OA5D4R3A_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SAKE35CDDFBHBA5M6OA5D4R3A_size-normalized.JPG&w=1440&impolicy=high_res 1440w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/pat-behan-st-johns/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 10:00:00,
"After Dallas clinched the 1979 NFC East title by overcoming a 13-point deficit in the final three minutes of its  against rival Washington, Cowboys defensive end Harvey Martin headed for the visitors’ locker room at Texas Stadium, funeral wreath in hand. “See this?” Martin yelled at reporters before opening the door and tossing the wreath, which had a note of sympathy attached, at the feet of Washington offensive lineman Fred Dean. “They sent it to me this week.” After Dallas clinched the 1979 NFC East title by overcoming a 13-point deficit in the final three minutes of its  against rival Washington, Cowboys defensive end Harvey Martin headed for the visitors’ locker room at Texas Stadium, funeral wreath in hand. “See this?” Martin yelled at reporters before opening the door and tossing the wreath, which had a note of sympathy attached, at the feet of Washington offensive lineman Fred Dean. “They sent it to me this week.” The Dallas-Washington rivalry has cooled considerably since its peak, with blips of bitterness and excitement every few years providing reason to remember how intense it once was. Given what’s at stake for each team in Sunday’s regular season finale at FedEx Field, animosity toward the Cowboys from fans of the Burgundy and Gold might be at an all-time low. Forget a funeral wreath; a thank-you card for Dallas Coach Mike McCarthy’s team might be more appropriate if the outcome is the same as in 1979. If the season ended today, the Commanders  , putting them in prime position to select the   for decades. An upset win over Dallas on Sunday, coupled with an Eagles win against the Giants, would deny the Cowboys the NFC East title, but it would also likely cause Washington to fall several spots in the draft. The scenario has made for a strange week for Commanders faithful. “There are a variety of non-Commanders results in Week 18 that we want for our team to get that No. 2 overall pick, but the most important Week 18 result for bringing home that No. 2 overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft is the Commanders  to the Cowboys,” Al Galdi, who called Sunday’s showdown the “biggest must-lose game in Washington history,”  . “ … Chant with me: ‘We Want Dallas! We Want Dallas! (To win).’” On 106.7 the Fan, hosts JP Finlay and Brian Mitchell   on Tuesday if they were rooting for the Commanders to beat the Cowboys. “If you bleed burgundy and gold and are a true fan, you want them to win no matter what,” one fan suggested. But others are already looking ahead to next season. “I’m thinking they can go ahead and take this ‘L’ for me,” a caller from D.C. said. “I took a lot of lumps for them, they can take this ‘L’ for me.” In an unscientific poll on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, Kevin Sheehan of the Team 980 asked his 45,000 followers to pick between losing to Dallas and securing the No. 2 pick or beating the Cowboys to deny them the division title. Of the nearly 5,000 respondents, 88.5 percent chose a Commanders loss. “Big picture, when you look back on the 2023 season, that will be the saving grace,”   on his podcast. Pick one for next week   vs  : If the Cowboys hadn’t already clinched a postseason berth, the rooting calculus for Sunday’s game  be different for some fans. As it is, Washington spoiling the Cowboys’ hopes of hosting a first-round playoff game would make the equally detestable Eagles the NFC East’s first back-to-back division champs since 2004. A loss Sunday as 13-point underdogs is unquestionably the best possible outcome for the Commanders’ future, even though having the No. 2 pick in the draft does not guarantee a franchise-altering player. In 2019, Washington lost to the Giants in a Week 16 game dubbed the   because it gave the loser the inside track to drafting the Ohio State edge rusher. Washington clinched the No. 2 pick with a blowout loss at Dallas the following week, and, four months later,   after LSU quarterback Joe Burrow went first overall to the Cincinnati Bengals. Quarterbacks Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Herbert were taken fifth and sixth, respectively. Washington   to San Francisco in October. A new regime figures to be calling the shots for the Commanders at this year’s draft, the results of which will go a long way toward determining whether Washington and Dallas are playing pressure-packed late-season games against each other anytime soon. The teams’ showdown in December 1979 was among the greatest in series history, and resulted in one of Washington’s most painful losses. The winner would clinch the division, but the loser was in seemingly good position to earn one of the NFC’s two wild-card spots, provided the Bears didn’t make up a more than 30-point deficit in point differential. Chicago, which had scored 29 points over its previous three games combined, bludgeoned the St. Louis Cardinals, 42-6, to overcome Washington’s 33-point advantage coming into the week and steal the NFC’s final playoff berth. “To have the division title won with 40 seconds to go and then to be eliminated, well, it’s tough,” Washington Coach Jack Pardee told reporters after Roger Staubach led the Cowboys’ frantic comeback in what would be his final regular season game at home. As for the wreath, the Washington Star reported that it came from a flower shop in Rockville, and it had been sent by a Cowboys fan who was hoping to fire up the team. A few days after  , Martin sent Pardee a telegram apologizing for his actions. The Cowboys’ season ended with a playoff loss at home to the Rams. If Dallas wins Sunday, Commanders fans could be rooting for history to repeat itself next week.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKDQF7PB3ZFSNKJYB6LO7X3VUM.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKDQF7PB3ZFSNKJYB6LO7X3VUM.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKDQF7PB3ZFSNKJYB6LO7X3VUM.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKDQF7PB3ZFSNKJYB6LO7X3VUM.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKDQF7PB3ZFSNKJYB6LO7X3VUM.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QKDQF7PB3ZFSNKJYB6LO7X3VUM.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/commanders-fans-root-for-cowboys/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 12:49:00,
"PASADENA, Calif. — The Michigan Wolverines call the play “Twister.” It’s a simple way for them to describe the disaster they seek to create. The play involves multiple stunts, defensive linemen transposing their traditional gap responsibilities and players crashing toward the line of scrimmage from everywhere in one chaotic spiral. It’s a goal-line favorite. Man-to-man defense. No safety back to erase mistakes. Make a play or suffer the consequences. PASADENA, Calif. — The Michigan Wolverines call the play “Twister.” It’s a simple way for them to describe the disaster they seek to create. The play involves multiple stunts, defensive linemen transposing their traditional gap responsibilities and players crashing toward the line of scrimmage from everywhere in one chaotic spiral. It’s a goal-line favorite. Man-to-man defense. No safety back to erase mistakes. Make a play or suffer the consequences. In football, it’s a fairly common tactic, but of course Michigan adds a layer or two. That’s just Michigan with Jim Harbaugh as its coach — extra. “Coach was telling us this is the moment we were built for,” linebacker Junior Colson said. “This is the moment we come out here to play for.” On Monday night, to   in the Rose Bowl and clinch a berth in the national championship game, the Wolverines unleashed “Twister.” On fourth down, with Alabama needing three yards and an extra point to tie, this College Football Playoff semifinal — as retro as the stadium that hosted it — ended in the most proper way. There was Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe running to find daylight, and there was the Michigan defense, ready to swallow him one final time. Milroe scooped a low shotgun snap and sprinted up the middle. By the time he reached the line of scrimmage, the Michigan defense might as well have been a fence topped with barbed wire. Milroe squeezed one yard out of nothing. Defensive end Josaiah Stewart wrecked the play by shoving the massive right tackle JC Latham into Milroe’s path. At 360 pounds, Latham weighs 115 more than Stewart. Didn’t matter. On this day, no physical challenge was too great for the Wolverines. A Michigan player threw his helmet to the sky as the entire team rushed to meet at midfield. Maize confetti swirled through the stadium. Alabama,  , retreated to the locker room. It was time for Michigan, the maligned and controversial No. 1 team in the nation, to celebrate a victory that provided further validation even though it lives under a cloud of suspicion. For once, the Wolverines didn’t seem so defiant. That has been their disposition as the sign-stealing and impermissible scouting scandal continues to hover over their 14-0 season. But this wasn’t a “Michigan vs. Everybody” triumph. This was simply satisfaction. Finally, in the Wolverines’ third appearance in this four-team playoff, they advanced to the final. They’ll face   next week in Houston. Two years ago, eventual national champion  . Last season, they seemed unprepared for TCU, and their defense faltered  . This time, as the top seed, Michigan needed a breakthrough to fully reclaim its position among the sport’s superpowers. With the integrity of their success under suspicion for most of the season, it only added to the importance of a good showing. There may be nothing Michigan can do  . But like it or not, the Wolverines are here. Connor Stalions’s scheme was shut down months ago, and the program continues to reach heights that Harbaugh hadn’t achieved in his first eight seasons. While an NCAA investigation and potential punishment beyond Harbaugh’s three-game Big Ten suspension are pending, it would require a flabbergasting level of willful ignorance to dismiss what Michigan accomplished in outlasting the most persistent giant in the sport. “Glorious,” Harbaugh said of the victory. “That was glorious.” That was Michigan. It’s conceivable that, if the NCAA unveiled stunning new details about the depth of the cheating fiasco, we might be forced some day to pretend this didn’t happen. But until someone authorizes an asterisk, there is no denying that greatness belongs in the labyrinth of polarizing traits this team possesses. The Wolverines beat the Crimson Tide in a place where few dare to try — in the trenches. They sacked Milroe six times — five of them coming in the first half — to expose Alabama’s recurring issues protecting the quarterback. After a shaky start, they found stability by pounding the run and then leveraging the threat of it for quarterback J.J. McCarthy to create plays in the passing game. The matchup began with Michigan looking very much like the team that had failed to win a playoff game. McCarthy threw a terrible interception on the first play from scrimmage, but after a review, he was bailed out when Alabama defensive back Caleb Downs was ruled out of bounds. After the Michigan defense forced a three-and-out on Alabama’s first possession, returner Semaj Morgan muffed a punt — the first of several Wolverines gaffes on special teams — to give the football back to the Crimson Tide with a short field. Alabama made the most of the gift, scoring on a 34-yard touchdown run by Jase McClellan. Then Michigan settled down and asserted its dominance. With Blake Corum churning for yards, Michigan’s offensive line established the run. The Wolverines immediately answered Alabama’s touchdown and later reached the end zone again, taking a 13-7 lead after an errant extra point. While McCarthy finished those drives with touchdown passes, the Wolverines set up everything with power runs before surprising the Crimson Tide with their speed and dashes of offensive creativity. On defense, the Wolverines harassed Milroe. With less than four minutes left in the first half, Michigan had outgained Alabama 199-39. When the Wolverines stayed solid and resisted the cute plays, they overwhelmed the Crimson Tide. And just when you thought Michigan was all brawn, it would try something fancy. Most of the creative plays didn’t work. The one that did was stupefying: a gadget play in which McCarthy threw a quick pass to tailback Donovan Edwards, who threw a wild pass back to McCarthy. The quarterback corralled the ball with one hand. Then, while off balance and with Alabama linebacker Dallas Turner about to throw him to the ground, McCarthy unfurled a beautifully athletic 20-yard pass to Roman Wilson. He rose slowly from the turf, and once he lifted his head you saw his face mask was full of sod. It was a most accurate illustration of the way the Wolverines play. At the most surprising times, their grimy game looks good. The half felt like a blowout. But Michigan couldn’t separate from Alabama, which narrowed its deficit to 13-10 when Will Reichard made a 50-yard field goal with seven seconds left in the first half. Alabama took control in the second half, finding its running game and finally stifling Michigan’s pass rush. So with its championship aspirations on the line, Michigan had to do something it hadn’t been asked to do much this season: rally. Down 20-13 and facing fourth and two at his team’s 33-yard line with a little more than three minutes remaining, McCarthy converted with a pass to a wide-open Corum, who rumbled for 27 yards before an illegal block penalty trimmed 10 yards off the gain. On the next play, McCarthy ran for 16 yards. Then he found Wilson, who dashed 29 yards to the Alabama 5. Two plays later, McCarthy and Wilson connected again on the game-tying score. In overtime, Corum took control, scoring from the 25-yard line on two rushes. On the run that won the game, Corum — who was in a hospital recovering from knee surgery at this time a year ago — darted through the defense and refused to go down, spinning off tackles as he found the end zone from 17 yards. “When everyone is tired, when it’s overtime, he’s going to be the guy that shows up, just like he does in sprints when we run them in the offseason,” McCarthy said. “It was nothing new for me. It was just amazing the world got to see it.” The world got to see McCarthy, who threw for 221 yards and three touchdowns, at his steely best, delivering in the clutch. And it got to see the most complete defense in college football finish an epic game by denying Milroe. Michigan would be a likable team if not for, well, you know. But even with the shame, the players keep showing there’s more to this team. “Ecstatic joy” is how Harbaugh described his emotions. It sure beats defiance over self-inflicted wounds.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5EKHQ4OQET3S5GMWVOGIOEHWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5EKHQ4OQET3S5GMWVOGIOEHWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5EKHQ4OQET3S5GMWVOGIOEHWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5EKHQ4OQET3S5GMWVOGIOEHWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5EKHQ4OQET3S5GMWVOGIOEHWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5EKHQ4OQET3S5GMWVOGIOEHWY_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/02/michigan-defiance-greatness-rose-bowl/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 06:00:00,

Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid (1.84 million), Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant (1.81 million) and Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum (1.77 million) rounded out the top five. Though Antetokounmpo and James served as captains and drafted teams for the 2023 All-Star Game in Salt Lake City,   that it would revert to a traditional Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference format for the 2024 All-Star Game, which will be held at Indianapolis’s Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Feb. 18. Indianapolis is hosting All-Star Weekend for the first time since 1985. According to the fan vote, Antetokounmpo, Embiid, Tatum, Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton (1.38 million) and Bucks guard Damian Lillard (956,000) are the East’s projected starters. Joining James among the West’s early favorites were Durant, Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic (1.64 million), Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic (1.45 million) and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry (1.39 million). LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo lead their respective conferences in the first fan returns of   Voting presented by AT&T. Fans account for 50% of the vote to decide All-Star starters. NBA players and a media panel account for 25% each. Next fan update: 1/11.  There were no major surprises in the first returns, though Oklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has a strong case to earn a starting spot in the West’s backcourt. Gilgeous-Alexander, 25, is averaging 31.4 points, 6.4 assists and 5.9 rebounds per game while leading Oklahoma City (23-10) to the West’s second-best record entering Thursday. Lakers forward Anthony Davis also has a case to start in the West’s frontcourt, given that he is averaging 25.2 points, 12.5 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game. In the East, New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson (374,000) and Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell (624,000) deserve consideration as starters but are trailing far behind Haliburton and Lillard in the early results. As part of  , which was conceived to produce a more competitive atmosphere after  , the NBA will return to pitting 12 players from the East against 12 players from the West. While the league will still name team captains from each conference based on the results of fan voting, it will no longer have the captains draft their rosters. Additionally, the All-Star Game will return to a standard four-quarter, 48-minute game rather than using the Elam Ending, which includes a “target score” in the fourth quarter that ensures every contest ends on a game-winning shot. “I think [2023] was the lowest [television] rating we had in the last 10 years,” NBA executive vice president of basketball operations Joe Dumars said in October. “It didn’t make the product look good. You’re never in the business of putting your product out there, knowing it’s going to look bad and accepting that.” From 2018 to 2023, the NBA had team captains draft players from the pool of all-stars in two separate rounds to divvy up the 10 starters and 14 reserves. James served as a captain for all six years, compiling a 5-1 record against Antetokounmpo, Curry and Durant. The NBA adopted the Elam Ending, which uses an untimed fourth quarter, in 2020, with the goal of creating a more tense late-game atmosphere. The tweak was hailed as a success in its first year as  , and James memorably hit  . However, the scoring format was confusing to some viewers and didn’t prevent blowouts in 2021 and 2023. Last year’s game saw James and Antetokounmpo play sparingly because of minor injuries. This year’s all-star voting process will remain unchanged from past editions.

"Jonatan Giráldez, who guided Barcelona to the UEFA Women’s Champions League title last year, is the front-runner to become the Washington Spirit’s coach, three people familiar with the situation said Wednesday.

Jonatan Giráldez, who guided Barcelona to the UEFA Women’s Champions League title last year, is the front-runner to become the Washington Spirit’s coach, three people familiar with the situation said Wednesday. Giráldez, 32, has been at the top of the Spirit’s list since announcing last month that he will   in May.  , a Spanish news site, was first to connect Giráldez to the NWSL job. Washington has been without a coach since   two days after the season finale in October. “The head coach search has been ongoing for several months with multiple candidates,” the Spirit said in a statement Wednesday. “We look forward to sharing the news when the final candidate is confirmed.” Giráldez’s situation is complicated because he remains on the job with Barcelona, which sits atop  with a 12-0-0 record and is among the favorites to reach the Champions League final May 25 in Bilbao, Spain. Unless Giráldez and Barcelona decide to part ways in the coming months, the Spirit would have to wait until perhaps June before he arrives stateside. The NWSL draft is Jan. 12, and training camp will open no later than Jan. 29. The regular season schedule, featuring 26 matches for each of the league’s 14 teams, will commence March 16. But the Spirit, in prioritizing long-term goals, seems willing to wait for him, much like the U.S. women’s national team with Emma Hayes,   but will remain with Chelsea until May. Mike Bristol, the Spirit’s director of player personnel and an assistant coach, would become the prime candidate to oversee the team on an interim basis. Mami Yamaguchi is another staff holdover from last season, but Angela Salem left for an assistant job with expansion Bay FC in Northern California. The pursuit of Giráldez is consistent with Spirit owner Y. Michele Kang’s lofty ambitions in women’s soccer. She recently  , a second-division English club, and is awaiting approval from French authorities about her takeover of global power Olympique Lyonnais. Her NWSL property, however, has not fared well since she became majority owner shortly  . Over two seasons, Washington has posted a 10-15-19 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs.   and with a year left on his contract. Giráldez worked in the youth academy for Spanish club RCD Espanyol before becoming a Barcelona assistant in 2019. He was appointed the head coach before the 2021-22 season. Without much domestic competition, Barcelona has roared to four consecutive Liga F titles and a 70-1-1 record in the past 2½ seasons. The team lost to Olympique Lyonnais in the 2021-22 Champions League final before defeating Wolfsburg for the 2022-23 crown, its second continental trophy in three seasons. At a Dec. 18 news conference announcing he would not return next season,  : “The only thing I can say about my future is that it will not be in Europe. It is important not to compete against Barça.”  The Spirit agreed to a contract extension with D.C. United to continue using Inova Performance Complex in Leesburg as its training headquarters, two people with knowledge of the deal said. United opened the 30-acre facility in 2021. The Spirit also rents Audi Field for home matches. Kang has spoken about building her own headquarters, but the new pact will keep the team in Leesburg for at least three years.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTGHCGKNXAFGFIDQOGFTYDOGKY_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTGHCGKNXAFGFIDQOGFTYDOGKY_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTGHCGKNXAFGFIDQOGFTYDOGKY_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTGHCGKNXAFGFIDQOGFTYDOGKY_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTGHCGKNXAFGFIDQOGFTYDOGKY_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VTGHCGKNXAFGFIDQOGFTYDOGKY_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/washington-spirit-jonatan-giraldez-coach/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 18:57:00,

SEATTLE — Tomas Tatar and Andre Burakovsky scored 3:43 apart late in the second period as the Seattle Kraken beat the Ottawa Senators 4-1 on Thursday night for their sixth straight victory. Yanni Gourde scored in the first period and Vince Dunn had an empty-net goal and an assist for the Kraken, riding a franchise-record 10-game point streak. Joey Daccord followed up his Winter Classic shutout with 32 saves, and Jordan Eberle added two assists. “It’s fun to see our guys play so well and get rewarded for it,” Daccord said. “We weren’t getting rewarded as much as we would have liked in the first little bit of the season.” Parker Kelly scored his third goal and Joonas Korpisalo stopped 24 shots for the Senators, who have lost three of four. “Five minutes cost us the hockey game,” interim coach Jacques Martin said. “Some areas of our game were good. I think it’s a step in the right direction, but we’ve got to learn the game is 60 minutes, and we’ve got to learn to manage the game better.” Daccord kept Ottawa off the board until Kelly’s deflection with 7:40 left. He hadn’t allowed a goal since early in the first period of Seattle’s win against Philadelphia on Dec. 29, giving him the longest shutout streak in team history. The expansion Kraken joined the NHL for the 2021-22 season. “It would have been nicer if I’d got another shutout tonight,” Daccord joked. “A win’s great, and I’m happy to just keep this train rolling.” Gourde slammed in a rebound midway through the first for his sixth goal this season. Tatar was given an open lane thanks to a nifty pass from Eberle and beat Korpisalo with 4:40 left in the second. Burakovsky added another with 57 seconds to go in the period when he converted a 2-on-1 pass from Kailer Yamamoto. It was the first goal this season for Burakovsky, sidelined most of the way with an upper-body injury. “It was a great play by him. I didn’t expect him to give it back to me,” Burakovsky said. “It feels good to have some luck on your side. I had lots of bad breaks this year and last year. It was good to see it go in, for sure.” Dunn added his empty-netter with just more than two minutes left in the third. “We were a little bit too much on our heels for a stretch of minutes, and that’s where the Tatar goal was a huge goal for us in this hockey game,” Seattle coach Dave Hakstol said. “And for Burky, that’s the type of goal that just helps continue getting him confident and feeling good about himself, so it was really good to see him finish that.” UP NEXT Senators: Play at Edmonton on Saturday.

"A 17-year-old Chinese student who went missing in Utah last week has been found unharmed, police said, adding that he appeared to be the victim of an elaborate “cyber kidnapping” scheme, a “disturbing criminal trend” in which scammers put people under duress and convince their families that they are being held for ransom. A 17-year-old Chinese student who went missing in Utah last week has been found unharmed, police said, adding that he appeared to be the victim of an elaborate “cyber kidnapping” scheme, a “disturbing criminal trend” in which scammers put people under duress and convince their families that they are being held for ransom. Kai Zhuang, who was living in Riverdale, was discovered “alive but very cold and scared” inside a tent in remote mountains near Brigham City, Riverdale Police Chief Casey Warren said in a   Sunday. The teen was probably instructed by those conducting the scam to isolate himself, he said. Exchange students, particularly from China, are often targeted in virtual kidnapping cases, Warren said, adding that victims “often comply out of fear that their families will be harmed if they do not comply with the cyber kidnappers.” Warren did not identify the perpetrators in Kai’s case or where they were operating from, and said police were still investigating. According to the  , while the crime can take on myriad forms, it is “always an extortion scheme” in which families are tricked into believing that a loved one has been abducted and are coerced into paying a ransom, though the person claimed to be missing has not actually been taken. Families are often sent voice recordings and photos by the perpetrators in a bid to convince them that the crime is taking place, the Riverdale police statement said. In a statement after the rescue, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said the student “is now in good condition,” and cautioned Chinese citizens in the United States, especially students, “to boost safety awareness, take necessary precautions, and stay vigilant against ‘virtual kidnapping’ and other forms of telecom and online fraud.” Warren said Kai’s high school contacted police on Thursday and reported him missing, saying his family in China received photographic evidence appearing to show that he was being held captive. Kai’s host family in Riverdale was unaware that he was missing, and there was no evidence to suggest the teen had been “forcefully taken,” police said. Police said that the teen was being “manipulated and controlled” by the perpetrators in the days before he was found and that he apparently “was isolating himself at the direction of the cyber kidnappers.” Kai’s relatives in China said they received “continuous threats” — and as a result transferred approximately $80,000 in ransom to bank accounts in the country, according to the police statement. Riverdale police said they worked with the FBI, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and Chinese officials to locate the student and were concerned that he would “freeze to death” amid extreme temperatures, which can be   minus-9 degrees Fahrenheit this time of year. Officers used drones to search the woodland and hiked to reach the secluded area where Kai was eventually found camping alone over the weekend, police said. Kai “had no heat source inside the tent, only a heat blanket, a sleeping bag, limited food and water and several phones that were presumed to be used to carry out the cyber kidnapping,” Warren said. In recent years, FBI officials have  that they hope will prevent people from falling victim to scams like the one that played out in Utah over the weekend. The crime was once limited to Mexico and Southwestern border states but now impacts residents across the United States, the FBI said. The tactic “is always an extortion scheme that tricks victims into paying a ransom to free a loved one they believe is being threatened with violence or death,” the FBI said. Victims forced into isolation are usually monitored by perpetrators using Skype or FaceTime calls, Riverdale police said. Families of those believed to be kidnapped are usually asked to transfer ransom payments online — though cash drops have been made in some cases, police said. According to FBI guidance, people should be wary of calls that do not come from the those they victim’s phone number and should not engage. “Do not send money,” Riverdale police added in their statement. Kai was “relieved” to be rescued, Warren said. The police department shared footage on Facebook showing officers approaching the tent in the desolate spot, propped up on ground blanketed by snow. The teen is seen in the video holding his head in his hands as officers at the scene attempt to comfort him. Kai was checked over by medical professionals and cleared of any concerns, and had just two requests for the investigators who found him: to speak to his family and to eat a warm cheeseburger — “both of which were accomplished,” police said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWJX3K6M5TVNL6RHOYZ4KUM2HI.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWJX3K6M5TVNL6RHOYZ4KUM2HI.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWJX3K6M5TVNL6RHOYZ4KUM2HI.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWJX3K6M5TVNL6RHOYZ4KUM2HI.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWJX3K6M5TVNL6RHOYZ4KUM2HI.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OWJX3K6M5TVNL6RHOYZ4KUM2HI.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/01/02/missing-utah-student-kai-zhuang-found-cyber-kidnapping/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 11:17:00,
"BAGHDAD — A U.S. airstrike here on Thursday killed an Iran-linked militia commander and risked accelerating the regional fallout from Washington’s support for Israel’s military operation in Gaza, even as the Biden administration scrambles to contain the bloodshed. Explosions occurred in the central part of the city, rattling windows and prompting Iraqi authorities to close off nearby streets. Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, a militia that has claimed several attacks on U.S. forces, said its deputy commander of operations in the Baghdad region, Mushtaq Talib al-Saidi, also known as Abu Taqwa, was killed at a logistical support headquarters on Palestine Street. BAGHDAD — A U.S. airstrike here on Thursday killed an Iran-linked militia commander and risked accelerating the regional fallout from Washington’s support for Israel’s military operation in Gaza, even as the Biden administration scrambles to contain the bloodshed. Explosions occurred in the central part of the city, rattling windows and prompting Iraqi authorities to close off nearby streets. Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, a militia that has claimed several attacks on U.S. forces, said its deputy commander of operations in the Baghdad region, Mushtaq Talib al-Saidi, also known as Abu Taqwa, was killed at a logistical support headquarters on Palestine Street. While the United States has targeted militia-affiliated locations in Iraq and Syria several times in recent months, an American operation in such a central location of Iraq’s capital is exceedingly rare. Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba falls under the command of the Iraqi army, which responded swiftly — and in anger — saying agreements between Baghdad and Washington had been violated. A Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder, described the strike as “a necessary and proportionate action” against a militant leader “actively involved in planning and carrying out attacks against American personnel.” An “associate” of Abu Taqwa also was killed, Ryder said, though he did not identify the individual. The general noted that no civilians were injured in the strike and no infrastructure was damaged, a claim the The Washington Post could not independently verify. Thursday’s violence underscored the tension that has gripped   since early October, when fighting erupted between Israel and Hamas. In recent days, incidents   and   have heightened alarm that the fighting in Gaza will seep beyond the Palestinian enclave’s borders and draw the United States into a far larger conflict with groups armed by Iran. Ryder declined to say whether the United States had notified the Iraqi government before the strike. Asked if Washington had breached any agreement with Baghdad, he said that the Pentagon retains the right to self-defense anywhere U.S. forces are threatened. Photographs purportedly taken at the scene of the airstrike and released by Sabereen News, a militia-run outlet, show weapons fragments consistent with the U.S.-made Joint Air-to-Ground Missile, or JAGM, a new missile that is set to replace older munitions such as the Hellfire. The Post was unable to independently verify the images’ authenticity. When nearby residents learned that the blast was caused by American forces, some expressed fears that more violence would follow. “It’s an indication that peace is not lasting,” said Sarah Jamal, 27, who lives several blocks from the attack site. “It started in Syria, then Lebanon,   and now here. We’re being dragged into this, and we have no say.” As black smoke rose from residential alleys where blood and human remains lay scattered, some people cried. Others promised revenge against the United States. “No American soldier shall stay in Iraq!” one man yelled, firing his gun into the air. About 2,500 U.S. personnel are based in the country to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State terrorist network, which on Thursday   for a deadly attack in Iran a day earlier. Another 900 American personnel are spread across several outposts in Syria, tasked with the same mission. The Biden administration says it is working to prevent the  , which began when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in attacks throughout Israeli border communities, from spreading to other parts of the Middle East. But in Iraq and Syria, Washington’s support for Israel’s actions — as Palestinian deaths have surpassed 22,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry — has presented local militia groups with fresh incentive to try to dislodge U.S.-led coalition troops. U.S. officials have logged about 120 attacks since Oct. 17, with most carried out with one-way attack drones, rockets or both. Late last month, after a militia attack in northern Iraq left a U.S. service member in critical condition, the Pentagon launched   and said they probably killed a number of militants. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who last year backed the need for U.S. troops in Iraq to prevent the regeneration of the Islamic State, said the U.S. retaliation in that instance killed an Iraqi service member and injured 18 other people, including civilians. Thursday’s attack was likely to increase pressure on the Iraqi government to hasten an end to the coalition’s presence, 2½ years after their combat mission officially ended there. Iraq’s military spokesman, Yahya Rasool Abdullah, described the strike as “no different from terrorist acts” and said that the army held the U.S.-led coalition responsible for an attack on a group that fell under its command. “We consider this targeting a dangerous escalation and an assault on Iraq, far from the spirit and text of the authorization and the work for which the international coalition exists in Iraq,” Abdullah said in a statement. The question of ongoing U.S. troop presence has been under discussion as part of a joint dialogue between Iraqi and American officials. Al-Sudani has signaled in recent days that it may be time to end the presence of U.S. and allied forces in Iraq, citing the increasing capabilities of Iraqi troops. While al-Sudani’s government favors an arrangement that sets the two nations on even footing, rather than one that gives the appearance of continuing to host a military that invaded the country two decades earlier, Washington has been wary of fully withdrawing from one of its most high-profile theaters at a time of growing regional tensions. “This has put the [Iraqi] government in a very difficult position. The impact is that it’s hardening public opinion” against the remaining U.S. troop presence, said Sajad Jiyad, a fellow at the Century Foundation. Thursday’s strike was probably conceived as a means to signal there will be a cost for any future attacks on U.S. troops, Sajad said. But the strategy, he added, had “a lot of potential for escalation, a lot of potential for miscalculation.” The strike came almost four years to the day that President   ordered the killing of Iran’s most influential military strategist, Maj. Gen Qasem Soleimani, as he left Baghdad’s airport with his Iraqi counterpart, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis It was a decision that pushed Iran and the United States to the brink of war on Iraqi soil, as Tehran launched ballistic missiles against U.S. troops and an incandescent Iraqi parliament voted in favor of America’s expulsion. On Thursday, some Iraqi officials signaled it was time to finish the job. “We urge the Iraqi government to take decisive steps to end the presence of the so-called international coalition in Iraq,” said Qais al-Khazali, who heads the influential Iran-linked Asaib al-Haq militia. This, he said, would involve “cutting off the pretexts used by the Americans to prolong their stay on our land and in our skies.” The conflict in Gaza has sparked escalation on fronts across the Middle East, as Iran-linked groups opposed to the U.S. presence and Israeli policy launch their own retaliatory attacks and, in Lebanon, a suspected Israeli airstrike killed a high-ranking Hamas leader, Saleh Arouri on Tuesday. In a speech watched across the region, Hasan Nasrallah, leader of the Lebanese militant group and political party Hezbollah, vowed “response and punishment.” In Israel, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein met with Israeli officials as part of ongoing efforts to broker a deal that could avert a wider conflict across the Israeli-Lebanese border. Deepening the quagmire, Houthi militants detonated a one-way, unmanned surface vessel in a shipping lane off the coast of Yemen on Thursday, a U.S. admiral said, despite what the White House described a day earlier as a “very serious warning” over the need to desist. Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, commander of U.S. naval forces in the Middle East, told reporters in a briefing that the use of an unmanned surface vessel by the militants was “of concern” and a “new capability.” The vessel was launched from Yemen and “clearly had the intent to do harm,” Cooper said. A coalition of more than 20 countries has joined the United States under the umbrella of Operation Prosperity Guardian in a bid to secure shipping routes in the Red Sea, officials have said. No commercial vessels have been hit since the operation began, though some have come close. Eleven drones, two cruise missiles and six anti-ship ballistic missiles have been taken down since Dec. 18, and U.S. forces   on Dec. 31 after they opened fire on American helicopters. U.S. sailors have also brought down 61 missiles or drones launched from Yemen since October, and there are now significantly more warships and reconnaissance flights over the southern Red Sea than there have been in years, Cooper said. On Tuesday, Cooper visited the USS Carney, a destroyer that has responded to numerous Houthi attacks in recent weeks, and awarded U.S. sailors Combat Action Ribbons. The military award denotes they were in direct combat, though administration officials have said that it is not clear if U.S. ships have been directly targeted or simply nearby when attacks are launched. Cooper said that U.S. military personnel have taken the “appropriate approach of protecting themselves and downing these missiles.” “Easy call,” he said, “as was the fact of awarding a Combat Action Ribbon to the sailors who were involved in this.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4L2TL7ORTILIEMNU6WPQ6Y4RP4.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4L2TL7ORTILIEMNU6WPQ6Y4RP4.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4L2TL7ORTILIEMNU6WPQ6Y4RP4.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4L2TL7ORTILIEMNU6WPQ6Y4RP4.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4L2TL7ORTILIEMNU6WPQ6Y4RP4.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4L2TL7ORTILIEMNU6WPQ6Y4RP4.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/04/us-strike-baghdad/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 19:52:00,

A new   affirms that the   of   and the political right has had an impact three years hence, by adjusting views in a more sympathetic direction to Trump and those who stormed the Capitol. But what the poll also shows is that most Americans have not bought into that revised version of events. And the events remain a distinct political liability for Trump heading into 2024 — the kind of liability that could still damage Trump once voters are reacquainted with the particulars. The top line is that voters on the right have increasingly agreed with the idea that   participants and Trump’s actions weren’t so egregious. Compared to the same poll two years ago, Republicans are less likely to believe that those who stormed the Capitol were “mostly violent” and that Trump bears responsibility for the events (similar to other   that have tested views over time). They’re now even more likely to say that President Biden’s win was illegitimate. They’re also more likely to believe that legal punishments for participants are “too harsh.” But that last one is a good encapsulation of how limited the revisionism’s reach has been. While Trump has made pardoning Jan. 6 participants a key 2024 plank, only 42 percent of Republicans buy into the idea that their legal punishments have been too harsh. A majority of the GOP says the punishments have been either “fair” (37 percent) or “not harsh enough” (17 percent). Similarly, just 35 percent of Republicans say that those who entered the Capitol that day were “mostly peaceful” — despite the efforts of   to make that case. (A plurality of Republicans say that participants were “equally peaceful and violent.”) Other data also shows that while the choir on the political right has grown, Trump is still largely preaching to the choir: In total, the picture is of a revisionism effort that has worked, but largely just with people who were predisposed to believe its messengers. And Jan. 6 and Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election are something that clear and consistent majorities of the American public — and electorate — still regard as being a stain on our nation’s history. That includes smaller but significant numbers of Republicans. The narrative since Trump’s indictments has often been that they helped him. But while that’s apparently true when it comes to the prospect of winning the GOP nomination, it’s less evident that it’s the case with the general election. Indeed, Trump’s polling in the general has improved, but that could just as easily owe to Biden’s declining political stock and fading memories of events like Jan. 6. Those memories won’t remain as faded. Trump could face one or possibly even two criminal trials focused on his Jan. 6-related actions before Election Day 2024. And 56 percent of Americans lean toward his being guilty — with a minority of his own base convinced he’s innocent. Trump, meanwhile, has pressed forward with a version of events that majorities of Americans continue to reject. Those views rejecting Trump’s version of events could also gain more political currency as we approach another election in which Trump has increasingly signaled he’ll likely reject the results. The new poll shows 71 percent of Americans say they’re not confident Trump will accept the 2024 results if he loses — at which point the many people who viewed what happened after the 2020 election as being very bad could be made to fear some kind of repeat.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZJJLMQ3NCSNOL25NDWK7K62Z4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZJJLMQ3NCSNOL25NDWK7K62Z4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZJJLMQ3NCSNOL25NDWK7K62Z4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZJJLMQ3NCSNOL25NDWK7K62Z4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZJJLMQ3NCSNOL25NDWK7K62Z4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WZJJLMQ3NCSNOL25NDWK7K62Z4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/02/limits-trumps-jan-6-revisionism/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 12:11:00,
"A blaze that erupted Wednesday at the home of Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill began with a child playing with a cigarette lighter, according to police. According to an incident report obtained Thursday from police in Davie, Fla., a child in a bedroom in the home was said to have found an orange lighter in a toy box and to have “started squeezing it.” When the lighter set flame to a toy, per the report, he and another child in the room threw the toy away and ran from the room to alert an adult. A blaze that erupted Wednesday at the home of Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill began with a child playing with a cigarette lighter, according to police. According to an incident report obtained Thursday from police in Davie, Fla., a child in a bedroom in the home was said to have found an orange lighter in a toy box and to have “started squeezing it.” When the lighter set flame to a toy, per the report, he and another child in the room threw the toy away and ran from the room to alert an adult. Davie’s fire marshal told the   Thursday that an investigation into the cause of the fire is now closed.  Hill left a practice session early Wednesday to return to his home in Southwest Ranches, a Broward County town located approximately 10 miles from the Dolphins’ training facility. Aerial footage taken by local news stations showed Hill arriving in the afternoon and greeting his wife and mother. BREAKING: Tyreek Hill’s house is currently on fire. Firefighters have been battling the massive house fire for about 25 minutes and it is unclear if anyone was inside at the time. Tyreek Hill is currently at practice.  Hill’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, told reporters at the scene that while some of the player’s family members were at the residence when the fire broke out, they escaped unharmed. “No one was injured, number one, no pets, so for that we’re very grateful,”  . “We’re very grateful to the firefighters that put the fire out. Thankfully, the fire was contained to a limited area in the home. Obviously, there’ll be some smoke and water damage. “It’s very difficult for anybody, obviously, to have your home catch on fire, but Tyreek was handling it, he and his family, with as much poise as you could hope.” Rosenhaus added that Hill would have no immediate comment on the fire. An official with the Davie Fire Rescue Department told   the blaze was limited to the upper levels and roof of the home. Firefighters were shown in the aerial footage using chain saws to cut holes in the roof and a firetruck crane to blast water into the mansion. Emergency personnel and the Dolphins echoed Rosenhaus’s statement that no one was harmed. After practice at the Dolphins’ facility in Miami Gardens, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa expressed gratitude that the fire only damaged his teammate’s property. “I think the main thing is his family is safe,” Tagovailoa   reporters. “His loved ones are good. He’s good as well. I know it’s a little cliché to say, but those things like that, part of the house, some of those things can be replaceable. I’m just glad that a lot of his family members are safe.” “Obviously I’m praying for everybody,” Dolphins wide receiver Braxton Berrios  . “I heard everybody is safe, so that’s amazing. That’s all you can ask.” Awful…. Tyreek Hill and his wife are at the scene of the fire at their house.  It appears everyone is doing ok, thankfully 🙏  They are searching for the source of the fire as the firefighters are working to get the situation under control (Via… Hill bought the residence several weeks after he was   to the Dolphins in March 2022 from the Kansas City Chiefs and signed a four-year, $120 million contract extension, with $72.2 million in reported guarantees. At an average of $30 million per year, the deal makes Hill the   wide receiver in the NFL. According to  , Hill paid $6.9 million for the 9,300-square-foot mansion, which was built in 2007 and includes seven bedrooms and two guesthouses. In the footage shot Wednesday, Hill was seen wearing a walking boot on his left leg. He has been dealing with an ankle injury since a Week 14 loss to the Tennessee Titans that caused him to miss a game the next week against the New York Jets. Hill was listed Wednesday as a limited practice participant ahead of a crucial game Sunday night against the Buffalo Bills. In the final game of the NFL’s regular season, 11-5 Miami hosts 10-6 Buffalo in a showdown that will determine which team wins the AFC East and gets the No. 2 seed in the AFC playoffs.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRNHYIWQFN7RCBWQVIOCZNJBEU.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRNHYIWQFN7RCBWQVIOCZNJBEU.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRNHYIWQFN7RCBWQVIOCZNJBEU.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRNHYIWQFN7RCBWQVIOCZNJBEU.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRNHYIWQFN7RCBWQVIOCZNJBEU.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JRNHYIWQFN7RCBWQVIOCZNJBEU.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/tyreek-hill-dolphins-fire-mansion/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 17:27:00,
"NEW ORLEANS — For most of Monday night, Michael Penix Jr. was easy to find. If his Washington Huskies were on offense, he had the ball in his hands, throwing darts from every arm angle, making one right read, then another, then pulling back a handoff to run straight through the teeth of Texas’s front. And if the Huskies were on defense, Penix, their 23-year-old quarterback, sat in the same spot on the bench, almost at midfield. NEW ORLEANS — For most of Monday night, Michael Penix Jr. was easy to find. If his Washington Huskies were on offense, he had the ball in his hands, throwing darts from every arm angle, making one right read, then another, then pulling back a handoff to run straight through the teeth of Texas’s front. And if the Huskies were on defense, Penix, their 23-year-old quarterback, sat in the same spot on the bench, almost at midfield. But in the last minute of the  , Penix walked to the sideline, disappearing in a crush of purple jerseys. No. 2 Washington’s defense was in the middle of a sinister experiment, seeing how far it could bend without breaking into a million tiny pieces. No. 3 Texas pushed to the Washington 28 with 30 seconds left … to the 12 with 15 seconds left … the Superdome shaking at the possibility of a final lead change. Penix watched Quinn Ewers, Texas’s quarterback, drop back as the clock hit all zeros. Dylan Morris, Washington’s starter until   before last season, slid in next to Penix, their whole season riding on another player’s throw. Now let’s back up a moment. Games are not decided solely by the end, no matter how much the drama of endings can make it seem that way. They are decided when a quarterback goes 29 for 38 for 430 yards and two touchdowns. They are decided in the first quarter, when that quarterback’s first pass is a 77-yard gain that leads to a tone-setting score. They are decided in the second quarter, when that quarterback sprays completions on a nine-play touchdown drive. They are decided in the third quarter, when that quarterback, tasked with somehow outdoing himself, steps up in the pocket and fires a laser, splitting two defenders to hit Jalen McMillan for another touchdown. Or maybe games are decided, at least somewhat, when that quarterback completes 12 passes in a row. Big games are often decided by big-time players, one micro decision at a time. So as it was, the Sugar Bowl — a 37-31 win for Washington over Texas after Ewers’s final pass was knocked incomplete — was decided by Michael Penix Jr. And that nudged Washington to a matchup   for the national title Monday. “With a good defense like we were facing in Texas, he had to kind of resort to all the tools that he has and all the skill sets that make him special and … in my mind, the best player in college football,” Washington Coach Kalen DeBoer said. “This guy, really all month, was on another level as far as his mission to make sure that this happened.” WASHINGTON HOLDS ON‼️ THE HUSKIES ARE GOING TO THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 🏆    Don’t stop at 14-0 on the season, Washington’s last before joining Michigan in the Big Ten later this year. Since Penix and DeBoer teamed up, the Huskies are 25-2 overall and 10-0 against ranked opponents. Penix, who once  , was a Heisman Trophy finalist last month and is still playing — still thriving — in January. On Sunday night, before the game of his life, he asked his teammates to come 15 minutes early to a meeting so he could address them himself. DeBoer didn’t know Penix’s plans. But the Huskies are used to following Penix, to watching everything he does and listening to everything he has to say. “Man, I feel like everything happened for a reason,” Penix said after the win. “Coming out of high school, I’m going to be honest … when I committed to Indiana University, my dad, he didn’t really want me to go there. He didn’t understand why I was going there. So that was something that was hard for me, just having somebody that I love the most not really … he didn’t see my vision. But obviously it led me to here.” “He’s our rock,” said Morris, who spent most of Monday’s game with Penix, chatting when Penix wanted to chat, giving him space when he seemed in a quieter mood. “Nothing with him surprises me anymore because we see it every day. The building could have been literally falling down tonight and he would have stayed calm.” In that final minute, after Penix left his seat on the bench, Morris stood on it and pumped the crowd for more noise. But for the last few plays, he stood by Penix, then told him he loved him when the game was theirs. While his teammates scrambled, trading helmets for hats, pulling T-shirts over their jerseys and pads, Penix did an ESPN interview at the center of the field. Once it was over, a public relations staffer steered him toward the stage, where he was showered with confetti and awarded a trophy as the Sugar Bowl’s most outstanding player. At some point, the remaining fans belted Prince’s “Purple Rain.” Penix shouted into a few random iPhones that were shoved into his hand. On his way to the stage, Troy Dannen, Washington’s athletic director since October, wrapped Penix in a bear hug. One Husky, talking quietly to another, called the left-handed quarterback “that f---ing dude.” “He was at the bottom; he was at the top,” said Rome Odunze, Penix’s top wide receiver. “And he was at the bottom again, and now he’s at the top, shining.” After the ceremony, Penix had one thing in mind: family. Behind the Huskies’ bench, they all wore his No. 9 jersey, jumping up and down as he approached. To reach them, he cut through the crowd without stopping, Euro-stepping past one photographer and juking by the next. His relatives and friends passed his trophy through the first couple of rows. They posed for a group photo or 10. Soon, Penix would move along the railing and give every fan a high-five. When he would see a young boy, he would reach out his hand, inviting the kid to tug off his white wristband and take it home. But first, Penix considered how to get into the stands to hug his loved ones. He pressed his hands against a folding table, seeing if it could bear his weight should he use it as a trampoline. All together, his family yelled and held their hands up, telling him to not even think about it. Monday was not the end. Penix still has Michigan to beat.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HTF3Z5OCHTRICTM6YB5HOOKOAY.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HTF3Z5OCHTRICTM6YB5HOOKOAY.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HTF3Z5OCHTRICTM6YB5HOOKOAY.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HTF3Z5OCHTRICTM6YB5HOOKOAY.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HTF3Z5OCHTRICTM6YB5HOOKOAY.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HTF3Z5OCHTRICTM6YB5HOOKOAY.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/02/michael-penix-jr-sugar-bowl/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 06:10:00,
"Fifteen years after Ricky Rubio arrived on the NBA’s landscape riding a transatlantic hype wave, the Spanish point guard officially exited with a whisper — announcing his retirement Thursday after 12 seasons. T  have been foreign-born players, but Rubio generated more intrigue as a teenager than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid combined. Though his NBA career got off to a delayed start, never produced an all-star appearance and ended abruptly in heart-wrenching fashion, Rubio will be remembered as a signature figure of the early social media era. His catchy alliterative name, brilliant passing and prodigy bona fides — he started playing professionally in Spain at 14 — made him an intoxicating figure for basketball die-hards grappling through a slower and uglier era of hoops and eager to watch newly accessible tape of young players from across the globe. Fifteen years after Ricky Rubio arrived on the NBA’s landscape riding a transatlantic hype wave, the Spanish point guard officially exited with a whisper — announcing his retirement Thursday after 12 seasons. T  have been foreign-born players, but Rubio generated more intrigue as a teenager than Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid combined. Though his NBA career got off to a delayed start, never produced an all-star appearance and ended abruptly in heart-wrenching fashion, Rubio will be remembered as a signature figure of the early social media era. His catchy alliterative name, brilliant passing and prodigy bona fides — he started playing professionally in Spain at 14 — made him an intoxicating figure for basketball die-hards grappling through a slower and uglier era of hoops and eager to watch newly accessible tape of young players from across the globe. Before pace and space swept through the NBA, the baby-faced and floppy-haired Rubio promised to be the engine of a fun and freewheeling show. At 6-foot-2, he lacked the size of Magic Johnson or LeBron James, yet he rifled risky bounce passes through traffic, looked off defenders with ease and appeared to have the magnetic quality shared by so many great floor generals. The Minnesota Timberwolves   in the 2009 draft — two spots before Stephen Curry, famously, and ahead of future all-stars such as DeMar DeRozan, Jrue Holiday and Jeff Teague — even though Rubio didn’t initially seem thrilled to play for the wayward franchise. Rubio played two seasons in Barcelona before debuting for Minnesota in 2011 at age 21, and he wasted no time racking up assists, earning all-rookie honors and establishing himself as a fan favorite. But Rubio never blossomed into the star so many people transfixed by his YouTube and Twitter highlights foresaw. Instead, he suffered a torn ACL during his rookie season, his production flatlined and his jumper never developed. As the years passed, the story of his career evolved from “What a prospect,” to “What a shame,” to “What could have been.” His six years in Minnesota passed without a playoff appearance. The dysfunctional organization fired David Kahn, the oft-criticized executive who drafted him, and cycled through Rick Adelman, Flip Saunders, Sam Mitchell and Tom Thibodeau as coach. Rubio fell short of being a franchise-changer, but he wasn’t a bust, either. He made up for his shooting limitations with quality on-ball defense and the inherent unselfishness that drew so much attention in the first place, and his reliability as a solid starter paid off with a pair of playoff trips with the Utah Jazz in 2018 and 2019. By then, Rubio’s baby face had been replaced by a thick beard, and the light joy that marked his early years gave way to a more serious chapter of his career. Rubio’s mother, Tona Vives,   in 2016 after battling lung cancer, and Rubio   her passing. Since 2021, he played sparingly and decided not to rejoin his latest team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, this past summer. In  , Rubio alluded to mental health struggles that contributed to his decision to walk away from the NBA. “July 30th was one of the toughest nights of my life,” Rubio said. “My mind went to a dark place. I kind of knew I was going on that direction, but I’ve never thought I wasn’t under control of the situation. The next day, I decided to stop my professional career. “One day, when the time is right, I would love to share my full experience with you all so I can help support others going through similar situations. Until then, I would like to keep it private out of respect for my family and myself, as I’m still working on my mental health. But I’m proud to say I’m doing much better and getting better every day.” The individual accolades and team accomplishments that eluded Rubio in the NBA are only half of his basketball story. Playing alongside the likes of Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol and Rudy Fernández on the Spanish national team, Rubio won a silver medal at the 2008  , a bronze medal at the 2016 Olympics, a gold medal at the 2019 FIBA World Cup and four EuroBasket medals. Alongside his countrymen, Rubio enjoyed several star turns: He scored 20 points to beat Argentina for gold at the 2019 FIBA World Cup, and he   in a quarterfinal loss to USA Basketball at the Olympics in 2021. Remembering Rubio requires looking back to the young Rubio, the one who made it look easy, as well as the older version, who kept battling through his evident pain. Rubio’s career didn’t go as planned, but it took him to some amazing places all the same.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SV3CMWKQGAQKEWAF75GKUNPDRQ.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SV3CMWKQGAQKEWAF75GKUNPDRQ.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SV3CMWKQGAQKEWAF75GKUNPDRQ.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SV3CMWKQGAQKEWAF75GKUNPDRQ.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SV3CMWKQGAQKEWAF75GKUNPDRQ.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SV3CMWKQGAQKEWAF75GKUNPDRQ.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/ricky-rubio-retirement/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 19:02:00,

RED WINGS 4, KINGS 3, SO LOS ANGELES — Robby Fabbri scored twice, Lucas Raymond and Patrick Kane converted in the shootout and Detroit defeated Los Angeles. Fabbri’s second two-goal game of the season helped Detroit snap a six-game losing streak to Los Angeles. Jeff Petry also scored for the Red Wings and Daniel Sprong had pair of assists. Alex Lyon made 40 saves. Adrian Kempe had his second two-goal game in eight days, but it wasn’t enough as the Kings lost their fourth straight. Kempe has eight points in the last six games. Matt Roy scored his first goal this season for Los Angeles. Alex Laferriere and Pierre-Luc Dubois assisted on both of Kempe’s goals. David Rittich stopped 23 shots. JETS 2, SHARKS 1 SAN JOSE, Calif. — Gabriel Vilardi broke a tie on a power play at 3:14 of the third period, All-Star goalie Connor Hellebuyck made 27 saves and Winnipeg beat San Jose to extend its point streak to a franchise-record 10 games. NHL-worst San Jose has lost 10 straight to fall to 9-27-3. The Sharks began the season with 11 consecutive losses. Winnipeg has won four in a row to improve to 24-9-4. Morgan Barron also scored for the Jets, who have allowed three or fewer goals in a franchise-record 27 straight games. Alexander Barabanov scored for San Jose, which hasn’t earned a point since beating the Jets 2-1 on Dec. 12. ___ AP NHL: ","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JTVZRDVLPAI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JTVZRDVLPAI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JTVZRDVLPAI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JTVZRDVLPAI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JTVZRDVLPAI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JTVZRDVLPAI65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nhl/2024/01/04/nhl-capsules/ec0b0162-aac8-11ee-bc8c-7319480da4f9_story.html,Washington Post,2024-01-05 01:54:00,

Only five call-ups have appeared in more than four U.S. matches. Thirteen are age-eligible for this summer’s  , which is an under-23 tournament, with three overage exceptions. Olympic Coach Marko Mitrovic will join the staff for this camp. “It really is an opportunity for young players, MLS-based players, to make their mark on this program,” Berhalter said. “We’re skewing slightly younger, and it’s still the same opportunity, though. … I really want them focusing on taking advantage of it.” Because this camp does not take place during an official international window, clubs are under no obligation to release players, MLS included. But the MLS season does not start until late February, so its teams typically allow players to attend. Berhalter said he requested two European-based players — former D.C.

"Prosecutors have repeatedly described Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in 2020 as effectively manufacturing a pretense for illegally overturning the election.

Prosecutors have repeatedly described Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud in 2020 as effectively manufacturing a pretense for illegally overturning the election. Special counsel Jack Smith said in his indictment of the former president that fake electors were meant to “ ” that could be used on  , 2021. In a new filing, Trump’s legal team appears bent on helping prosecutors make that case. Tucked into Trump’s latest  in his appeal for presidential immunity in his federal Jan. 6 case is a remarkable citation. His attorneys refer to a social media post from Trump the same day of the filing — Tuesday — which links to a   running down various voter-fraud claims. The filing cites the report to argue that there remain “vigorous disputes and questions about the actual outcome of the 2020 Presidential election.” The report, to put it lightly, is a mess. And that Trump’s legal team would see fit to include it in a filing would not seem to augur well for his defense. The report begins with a series of astonishing and false claims. “In actuality, there is no evidence Joe Biden won,” its first paragraph concludes. It then recounts how Trump led in key battleground states on election night and maintains that, as of that point, before millions of votes were counted, “the election was over.” But even Trump allies had acknowledged before the election that the expected late arrival of ballots from populous and heavily Democratic areas, as well as mail-in ballots, would create an illusion of an early Trump lead — a “ .” There is nothing suspicious about how those states flipped as time went on. The introductory paragraph also includes a footnote that says Arizona “was fraudulently called for Joe Biden by Fox News” on election night. A network’s calls on any given race do not determine the election, and Biden won Arizona. The report goes on to cite multiple accounts of alleged fraud that don’t appear to be publicly available. It cites seven chapters from an apparently voluminous “Report on Widespread Fraud in the Georgia 2020 Presidential Election.” No author or link is provided, nor does a report with such a title appear in a Google search. It also cites claims in 2023 from a woman named Kim P. Brooks, featuring titles that Google doesn’t recognize. Ditto a report from a man named Joseph Rossi called “Risk Limiting Audit Spreadsheet Analysis.” No links are provided to the claims or documents. A Trump campaign spokesman didn’t respond to a request for the documentation. The report goes on to cite purported evidence of voter fraud and irregularities in five key states. A sampling: These are just a few examples of the claims that have already been debunked or have no actual proximity to voter fraud. Many of the claims don’t appear to have been publicly lodged before the report’s release Tuesday and are difficult to trace because of the scant sourcing. Most of the report is devoted to supposed procedural irregularities that say nothing about a stolen election. At this point, it should be no surprise that Trump would press forward with promoting false voter-fraud claims. He has been doing it for more than three years, despite all the evidence to the contrary. But it’s one thing to say these things in public; it’s quite another to include them in a legal filing. Trump’s attorneys have been careful  , because doing so involves trying to substantiate them, and legal scrutiny has been unkind —  . Trump’s lawyers do not say that the claims in the report are true, instead using the document in an effort to substantiate the idea that there remain “vigorous disputes” and “questions” about the results. The aim is to apparently cite the smoke without actually claiming there’s fire. But what it demonstrates is how much this entire effort was about manufacturing smoke. And in that way, the Trump lawyers in effect just proved the prosecutors’ point.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKS6NS5WI7BI3J5DAFPGC2J7KM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKS6NS5WI7BI3J5DAFPGC2J7KM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKS6NS5WI7BI3J5DAFPGC2J7KM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKS6NS5WI7BI3J5DAFPGC2J7KM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKS6NS5WI7BI3J5DAFPGC2J7KM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TKS6NS5WI7BI3J5DAFPGC2J7KM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/03/trump-lawyers-doozy-filing-voter-fraud/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 14:11:00,

Maybe you’re hoping 2024 is the year you quit scrolling Instagram at bedtime or peeking at emails during family dinners. , who writes about time management, is skeptical of the typical life hacks to stop staring at your phone including using  , turning   or shutting off your internet service. For lasting change, Burkeman encourages us to understand what’s behind our tech compulsions. There are the attention-stealing features of technology, yes, but also our desire to feel in control or avoid what’s unpleasant. Your phone is a perfect escape. I found Burkeman’s 2021  , “Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals,” refreshing in encouraging us to neglect more things — including our social media feeds — to have energy for the people and things that we care about. It’s a difficult but urgent message. (The book title is a reference to the number of weeks in a typical life span. Scarily short.) If it bugs you that you can’t bear more than a few minutes without whipping out your phone (like me), read this condensed and edited version of my conversation with Burkeman: I’ve had a lot of success with deleting social media from my phone. I do have PDFs of reading material for my work, and I might read news on my phone, but I am not in the world of addictive attention when I’m doing that. It’s also important to ask what the habit you don’t like is providing you. I’ve had phases when what felt like too much time spent on technology was motivated by a desire to have more conversations in my day. Then it’s a question of trying to address your need in some other way.  Those aren’t useless, but they’re going to be a partial solution. Understanding what’s behind your habit shifts your perspective in a way that has ramifications in how you spend your days. Ultimately we are attracted to anything — including our technology — that can enable us to escape feelings of isolation or feel in control. If you’re going to spend a few hours focused on being present as a parent, have a difficult conversation with a spouse or try to write half a chapter of a book, you’re going to want to get away from that situation. Expecting the discomfort is a game changer because then you know what’s going on. After I wrote an   recently encouraging people not to listen to music or podcasts while we cook dinner or walk the dog, people asked if I was just making up things to feel bad about. My point was that it’s interesting how hard it has become for many of us to do just one thing at a time.  It’s easy to lecture yourself and say you should be more present in the moment. But then you sit there glumly, trying not to stare at your phone and instead follow your breath or whatever. It’s not fun. On my better days, I can encourage my curiosity and focus on what is interesting. I’m interested in how the restaurant staff keeps things going at a breakneck speed and who does what job. Or I could cogitate on what I’ve been pondering for work. I don’t make New Year's resolutions. I’ve become disillusioned with the idea of a total fresh start or an incredibly ambitious plan for what I’m going to do every day for the next year. If you’ve found it difficult to do physical exercise, for example, the idea that just resolving harder is going to deal with whatever is getting in the way is a red herring of self-help culture. On the other hand, I’m always making resolutions. As long as you are not kidding yourself that you’re going to find the perfect system, the perfect morning routine, the perfect set of habits, it’s fun to always be changing things up and experimenting.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQQSV2QZABFXRHTSI6N3ENDOVY.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQQSV2QZABFXRHTSI6N3ENDOVY.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQQSV2QZABFXRHTSI6N3ENDOVY.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQQSV2QZABFXRHTSI6N3ENDOVY.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQQSV2QZABFXRHTSI6N3ENDOVY.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FQQSV2QZABFXRHTSI6N3ENDOVY.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/02/technology-habits-to-break-2024/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 12:30:00,
"Sam Howell will be the first Washington quarterback since Kirk Cousins in 2017 to start a full season for the team, and it wasn’t by design.

He will start again Sunday against the Cowboys, stalling the   for just a little longer. But it’s bound to spin again soon. Sam Howell will be the first Washington quarterback since Kirk Cousins in 2017 to start a full season for the team, and it wasn’t by design. He was benched for Jacoby Brissett a week ago, then told hours before kickoff against the San Francisco 49ers that he would start. He will start again Sunday against the Cowboys, stalling the   for just a little longer. But it’s bound to spin again soon. Over the past two decades, Washington has started 22 quarterbacks. Only two — Jason Campbell (2008-09) and Cousins (2015-17) — started entire consecutive seasons. Stopping that trend that was on Ron Rivera’s lengthy to-do list when he took over as coach in 2020, but his regime’s failure to find a franchise star may soon lead to his exit. “That’s the hardest thing for anybody,” Rivera said. “It doesn’t matter whether you’re here or [if] you’re at one of the other places that are looking for [a starting quarterback]. … If you get a head-coaching job where there’s a guy, you better relish that and you better succeed, I’ll tell you that right now.” Rivera would know. For seven of his nine seasons coaching the Panthers, he had  . But since he arrived in Washington, Rivera has churned through nine starters acquired via free agency, trades, the draft and even the Patriots’ practice squad ( ). “You see why such an emphasis is being made on protecting that guy [and] why these guys are getting paid the way they’re getting paid,” Riviera said. He then referenced  , when he was asked about the difference between the Commanders and the more successful NFC East teams. “I said, ‘Quarterback,’ ” Rivera recalled. “Trust me, it is.” It would be simplistic and unrealistic to think a quarterback alone could have solved Washington’s issues the past four years. The team’s struggles have been due to myriad factors, including the deterioration of a talent-packed defense, a slew of costly personnel decisions and a history of poor player development. But the inconsistency at quarterback has had a ripple effect. Think of the players who have had to adjust to new quarterbacks season after season, sometimes week after week. “At the end of the day, the quarterback gets the keys to the car,” said guard Sam Cosmi, who has blocked for five starting quarterbacks since 2021. “How he drives it and how he steers the car around, that’s the difference. … Every quarterback has a little bit different cadence [to] how they operate. Then the presence they have in the huddle, some quarterbacks take command. Some more experienced quarterbacks, they can tell you, ‘Hey, we’re doing this, this, this,’ or check the play.” Pass-catchers’ routes are typically synchronized with the quarterbacks’ drops, and they have to adjust their timing on the fly. “Guys who just have more experience know kind of where his hot [routes] are and different things that are built into the offense,” wide receiver Jahan Dotson said. “Another perfect example was Carson [Wentz] and Taylor [Heinicke]. It seemed like Taylor knew the offense like the back of his hand, whereas sometimes Carson, he had to pick up on things as he went. Those things just came second nature to Taylor.” When Washington   in Weeks 15 and 16 after benching Howell midgame, he immediately connected with receivers and rallied the offense, largely because he had a keen understanding of the opposing defenses. But it was back to Howell in Week 17 after  . “Consistency is a big factor because you just get familiar with each other,” Dotson said. “It’s just like any relationship in life. The more time you spend around each other, the better you guys are going to be at communicating. You’re going to be on the same page more often.” Terry McLaurin has yet to experience any consistency at quarterback, making his production at wideout all the more impressive. Since McLaurin entered the league in 2019, he has played with 11 total quarterbacks and caught at least one pass from 10 of them — not including his 28-yard catch from tight end (and former quarterback) Logan Thomas on a trick play in 2020. “I don’t use [quarterback turnover] as an excuse as to why I don’t do my job,” McLaurin said in July. “... Obviously, we know that’s something that factors into my position, but I’ve never used it as a crutch.” Across the NFL, Washington is hardly the only team that has churned through starters to find its next franchise quarterback. The Bills had 17 starting quarterbacks and only three playoff appearances in the 20 years after Jim Kelly retired. It wasn’t until they drafted Josh Allen with the seventh pick in 2018 that their fortune started to change. The Broncos have had 12 starters since Peyton Manning retired after the 2015 season. The Colts have had nine starters in the four years since Andrew Luck retired, the Saints have cycled through six since Drew Brees stepped away in 2021, and the Panthers are on their ninth starter since 2019. The Commanders’ best hope for quarterback stability might come in the April draft, in which they could have  . But until Washington finds that guy, the carousel of quarterbacks and coaches will continue to spin. “If a guy like Alex Smith, if he never gets hurt, I never come here,” Rivera said. “Because I think Jay [Gruden] and what they were doing would’ve continued. I mean, you get a guy like that, man, you run with it, I promise you that. It would’ve been cool to have a guy like that. It really would’ve.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3EVDFA6KC26MWNCNIWOTJPYQM.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3EVDFA6KC26MWNCNIWOTJPYQM.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3EVDFA6KC26MWNCNIWOTJPYQM.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3EVDFA6KC26MWNCNIWOTJPYQM.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3EVDFA6KC26MWNCNIWOTJPYQM.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F3EVDFA6KC26MWNCNIWOTJPYQM.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/commanders-starting-qbs-struggles/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 13:15:00,

Kirby Smart clearly didn’t watch the  . After  , 63-3, in the unwatchable exhibition game otherwise known as the Orange Bowl on Saturday afternoon, Georgia’s coach spent his postgame news conference huffing and puffing a designed structural failure into a faux crisis. “People need to see what happened tonight, and they need to fix this,” Smart said. “It needs to be fixed. It’s very unfortunate that [the Seminoles], who have a good football team and a good football program, are in the position they’re in. And everybody can say it’s their own fault, it’s their own problem. Everybody can say that we had our guys and they didn’t have their guys. I can listen to all that. But college football has got to decide what they want.” Oof, good luck on that last part, Coach. Smart was referencing the depletion of FSU’s roster before the bowl game. The   for this year’s four-team College Football Playoff despite running the table to a perfect 13-0. The selection committee’s reasoning centered, unfairly so, on the loss of starting quarterback Jordan Travis to   Nov. 18. Once the Seminoles were eliminated from postseason contention through no fault of their own, 23 players opted not to play in the meaningless Orange Bowl against Georgia, either entering the transfer portal or leaving school to prepare for the NFL draft. Basically, the players exercised their afforded agency to opt out of a system that opted out of their efforts this season. This enraged a decaying-yet-still-noisy class of college football traditionalists in the industry and the media, who see fit to completely ignore the mass desertion of coaches from bowl games every single season when they jump to new jobs. For decades, bowls have suffered from coaches leaving their teams to go work somewhere else immediately. It has never been treated (or even addressed) with the same pearl-clutching fervor as Florida State’s players rejecting a format that rejected them first. Yet the “bowl system is in trouble,” we’re being told. It’s not. Two nights before the Orange Bowl, the world’s first live, edible mascot ritually sacrificed itself in a house-sized toaster while holding up a sign that read “DREAMS REALLY DO COME TRUE.” Then Kansas State’s coach and players ate a Pop-Tart the size of a truck hood to celebrate a nine-win season. That was the Pop-Tarts Bowl in Orlando, and it was awesome. Kansas State’s and North Carolina State’s rosters turned out enough to create an enjoyable exhibition, and the ingenuity of the bowl organizers to create the Disney meets David Cronenberg mascot sacrifice for social media helped pull in 4.3 million viewers. Perfection!  The problem for television executives? That figure was down 20 percent from the previous year’s game featuring bigger brands (Florida State and Oklahoma), and when the College Football Playoff expands to 12 teams in 2024, fewer marquee schools will be available for these postseason exhibitions. But the industry optimist’s view of the Pop-Tarts Bowl is that a 20 percent decline is strong relative to the lack of star power, and the creativity of bowl games (and their corporate sponsors) is what will keep some of these exhibitions alive in the years to come. There is no bowl game crisis as long as the football is good and the games mean something: Florida State’s controversy aside, the New Year’s Day semifinals drew huge numbers (the peak rating of Alabama vs. Michigan was 32.8, the highest ever for a College Football Playoff semifinal). Thankfully, mercifully, this “New Year’s Six” system is dead after next week. We’re no longer being asked to watch meaningless games without bearing on the national championship between national championship-contending teams arbitrarily removed from the competition. Had Florida State and Georgia met in an opening-round game of an expanded postseason tournament, the Seminoles wouldn’t have fielded an empty roster and the game would’ve been far more compelling. But the reason the Orange Bowl was a meaningless exhibition instead of a postseason game is because of the bowls themselves, who fought a playoff for decades and then refused to expand its field past four teams in two games when the Bowl Championship Series died just over a decade ago. Instead, we’ve been served a decade of pointless “big” games, with declining ratings, lopsided results and uninterested programs to show for it. For every watchable “New Year’s Six” game, such as Mississippi’s defeat of Penn State in the Peach Bowl, there are three times as many asinine scrimmages, such as the Orange Bowl or Oregon turning Liberty into a skid mark at the Fiesta Bowl. The biggest problem with college football’s postseason from the beginning, now and next season on are the bowls themselves, not the players. The appetite of players and fans has evolved toward the meaningful, and the idea of a “prestigious” game of arbitrary value doesn’t hold the same value it once did. But that doesn’t mean bowls are dying. The stuffier, larger operations must acquiesce and either join a functional playoff format or die, and if you’re questioning the obviousness of that statement, I invite you to speak with bowl committee chairs sometime. It’s like stepping back in time 40 years in the most frightening way possible. The smaller, made-for-TV events in late December are already great for what they are, as long as the context is adjusted and things stay fun. Take the Duke’s Mayo Bowl in Charlotte, for example. If the Pop-Tarts stunt stole the bowl season narrative this year, it was a blueprint copied from Charlotte: For years, an otherwise ho-hum matchup usually between Power Five conference schools located east of the Mississippi with decent but not nationally relevant seasons in an outdoor stadium in chilly North Carolina has gleefully traded unearned seriousness for casual spectacle, and it works. Most notably, the winning coach has agreed to be   instead of Gatorade. That’s what happened to West Virginia Coach Neal Brown this year after the Mountaineers beat North Carolina. The scene was entirely stupid but had a warm intent. It was fun to watch, and I couldn’t help but assume Brown, who most assumed would be fired this season, found ending a surprise nine-win year with 20-odd gallons of cold mayo some kind of catharsis. This year’s Duke’s Mayo Bowl drew its highest rating since 2016. But because bowls are often arbitrarily scheduled at different times on different days each year by ESPN, take that for what it’s worth: Sometimes there’s a decent game on before the playoff starts. If the teams want to be there or if there’s something silly happening, you’ll probably watch for a while.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GCSJUNS2ACEYZV3IM25LRS4G3I_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GCSJUNS2ACEYZV3IM25LRS4G3I_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GCSJUNS2ACEYZV3IM25LRS4G3I_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GCSJUNS2ACEYZV3IM25LRS4G3I_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GCSJUNS2ACEYZV3IM25LRS4G3I_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GCSJUNS2ACEYZV3IM25LRS4G3I_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/are-bowl-games-broken/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 20:56:00,

Victor Wembanyama’s latest one-man carnival show packed a month’s worth of spectacular acts into a single night. During the San Antonio Spurs’ nationally televised 125-121 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday, the 7-foot-4 Frenchman  ,   after rotating the ball behind his back in transition,   and Damian Lillard at the rim late in the fourth quarter,   with a little over a minute left in regulation and drew three defenders to tee up Tre Jones for an unguarded three-pointer that could have forced overtime. The final damage included 27 points, nine rebounds, five blocks and a half-dozen other brilliant moments. San Antonio need not regret a competitive loss to a top-tier opponent such as Milwaukee, especially when Antetokounmpo more than held up his end of the international star showdown with 44 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. Wembanyama,  , remains right on schedule for greatness. Indeed, his stat line of 19.2 points, 10.1 rebounds and 3.2 blocks has  : Hall of Fame centers David Robinson, Shaquille O’Neal and Alonzo Mourning, all of whom spent at least three years in college before they were drafted. But an honest appraisal of the Spurs as they approach the Feb. 8 trade deadline requires acknowledging that Wembanyama desperately needs more help. While it’s no great surprise that San Antonio (5-29) has the Western Conference’s worst record and is tracking toward another top lottery pick, the first two-plus months of Wembanyama’s career have been choppier than expected. The Spurs suffered 18 straight defeats after a promising opening week, and their minus-11.4 net rating is the worst mark since the Charlotte Bobcats posted a minus-15.0 during the 2011-12 season. Young, rebuilding teams often endure growing pains as they pursue “organic development,” but that’s not the same thing as getting taken to the woodshed night after night. San Antonio struggles on both sides of the ball — especially when Wembanyama is off the court — but the worst crimes occur on offense. Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich’s bold experiment of shifting Jeremy Sochan from power forward to point guard hasn’t panned out. Jones, a more traditional floor general, got his first start of the season against the Bucks, but he lacks the size and athleticism to be an ideal long-term initiator for Wembanyama. In truth, there is no one on the roster capable of filling that role now or in the future. Devin Vassell is the Spurs’ top talent next to Wembanyama, but he is wired as a bucket-getter and should stick to what he does best. For all of Wembanyama’s gifts as a scorer, shot-creator, finisher, rim-protector and help-side defender, the first few months of the season have made it clear he will only reach his full potential with help from a ballhandling setup man. He’s tracking toward Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis, not LeBron James or Nikola Jokic. What’s also clear is that Antetokounmpo needed three years of gradual development to have a star’s impact when he first arrived in Milwaukee, but Wembanyama, who turned 20 on Thursday, has already reached that point. He isn’t a project and shouldn’t be treated like one. After selling off Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Jakob Poeltl to position themselves to draft Wembanyama, the Spurs must now shift gears and become buyers to facilitate his continued growth. While bottom-dwelling teams typically cut costs and stack draft assets at the trade deadline with an eye toward the summer, Wembanyama’s exceptional game should make the Spurs an exception to this practice. In weighing short-term trade options, San Antonio must look first to longer-term alternatives. This summer’s top free agent point guards — Jrue Holiday, James Harden and Tyrese Maxey — will have better options than San Antonio, and there’s a steep drop in talent after those headliners. Meanwhile, the 2024 draft class is regarded as relatively weak. Of the few point guards among the projected top-10 picks, none appears ready to drive wins immediately. Finding the right guard to complement a premier big man is an age-old basketball conundrum. The Los Angeles Lakers drafted Magic Johnson to run “Showtime” alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Orlando Magic traded for Anfernee Hardaway to pair with O’Neal and the Oklahoma City Thunder drafted Russell Westbrook and Harden to flank Durant on the perimeter. More recently, the Thunder flipped the order of operations by taking center Chet Holmgren with the No. 2 pick in the 2022 draft to create a killer duo with all-star guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. After missing last season with a foot injury, Holmgren has surprisingly emerged as the early rookie of the year favorite over Wembanyama given his strong production, his excellent efficiency and the Thunder’s status as one of the NBA’s best teams. Serbian teenager Nikola Topic would be a logical draft target for San Antonio, but lottery luck can come and go. The Spurs would be foolish to bet the next year or two of Wembanyama’s career on ping-pong balls alone, and they might find a more replicable model by turning to Davis’s time in New Orleans. Davis spent his rookie year playing with Greivis Vasquez, who was competent but unremarkable. The Pelicans then proactively traded for Holiday, who was a budding star at the time. Together, Davis and Holiday made the postseason twice and won a playoff series in 2018, though their supporting casts never quite came together and Davis eventually outgrew the Pelicans. New Orleans was criticized at times for doing too much too soon by acquiring veterans as it built around its young centerpiece, but Davis made the all-star team every season he played alongside Holiday. The 6-10 big man also never blossomed as a frontcourt distributor. Without Holiday’s orchestration, secondary scoring and on-ball defense, Davis’s patience with New Orleans would have been tested to an even greater degree. What’s more, it’s not a coincidence   after Milwaukee traded for Holiday to spread out the offensive playmaking responsibilities and shore up its perimeter defense. To be clear, San Antonio doesn’t need to act rashly and mortgage its long-term flexibility. Chris Paul, Malcolm Brogdon, Tyus Jones and TJ McConnell are among the veteran stand-in options expected to be available before the deadline. Maybe there isn’t a Holiday to be found, but the Spurs can at least shoot for a Vasquez type capable of providing a steadier set of hands down the stretch. Or, put another way, if Wembanyama is to be the heir apparent to Tim Duncan, San Antonio must find him an Avery Johnson as it conducts a broader search for his Tony Parker.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EYZOJVE57HVPJ7LHFSQXSDGYM.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EYZOJVE57HVPJ7LHFSQXSDGYM.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EYZOJVE57HVPJ7LHFSQXSDGYM.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EYZOJVE57HVPJ7LHFSQXSDGYM.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EYZOJVE57HVPJ7LHFSQXSDGYM.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7EYZOJVE57HVPJ7LHFSQXSDGYM.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/victor-wembanyama-san-antonio-spurs/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 08:05:00,

But the No. 7 overall selection informed the university Thursday that he was signing with United, one person said. United and Georgetown officials said they did not want to comment. Had Murrell not signed, United would have retained his MLS rights through 2025. Murrell is a McDonogh School graduate from Forest Hill, Md., who came through Pipeline SC, a Baltimore area youth program co-founded by former United attacker Santino Quaranta. He posted seven goals and four assists his freshman year at Georgetown and 11 goals and four assists this past season, including eight goals in the first nine matches. Last summer, Murrell played for the Annapolis Blues in the National Premier Soccer League, a fourth-division amateur circuit. With six players drafted, the Hoyas had the most selections among the 87 picks. Goalkeeper Ryan Schewe (Sporting Kansas City) was also taken in the first round. Junior defender Kieran Sargeant is expected to sign a homegrown contract with the Houston Dynamo. The immediate acquisition of Murrell is a small victory for United’s new general manager,  , who is in the process of building the roster after considerable turnover.

She was a TV analyst for the Dallas Wings from 2016-23, and served on the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association board from 2018-23. “The tradition and legacy of the Sparks has played a key role in the current trajectory and growth we are seeing in women’s sports,” Pebley said in a statement. “I am eager to partner with our players, front office, coaching staff and community as we foster a culture where our players are resourced with all the tools they need as they courageously chase the best version of themselves and compete for WNBA championships.” The 48-year-old from Fountain Valley, California, resigned as TCU women’s basketball coach in March. She had two years remaining on her contract. Pebley led the Horned Frogs to four WNIT appearances and three 20-win seasons, most recently in 2019-20. In her final three seasons, her teams had losing records. She coached at Utah State and Fresno State before taking over at TCU. Pebley played at Colorado before being drafted 21st overall by the Utah Starzz in 1997. She played for the Cleveland Rockers in 1998. “Raegan is an exceptional leader and culture builder,” Sparks managing partner Eric Holoman said. “She has deep knowledge of the women’s basketball landscape and brings expertise in player development, talent evaluation, analytics, and organizational leadership.” The Sparks hold the No. 2 and 12 overall picks in this year’s WNBA draft. ___ WNBA: ","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAFUKRFL64I65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAFUKRFL64I65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAFUKRFL64I65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAFUKRFL64I65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAFUKRFL64I65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAFUKRFL64I65PEMOMMUQDNE7E.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wnba/2024/01/05/los-angeles-sparks-gm-raegan-pebley/86ee5390-abf6-11ee-bc8c-7319480da4f9_story.html,Washington Post,2024-01-05 13:24:00,

LAS VEGAS — Hours after being named to the All-Star roster, Sam Reinhart had a goal and an assist and the Florida Panthers defeated the Vegas Golden Knights 4-1 on Thursday night. The Panthers won for the sixth straight time, while goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky made 26 saves to win his fifth consecutive start. Matthew Tkachuk and Carter Verhaeghe also registered a goal and an assist, while Sam Bennett added a goal. The Panthers completed a season sweep of the defending champs, not only exacting revenge for last season’s five-game loss in the Stanley Cup Final, but also winning in Vegas for the first time since the Knights joined the NHL. “I think maybe we needed a little adversity to really dig down and find a way,” Tkachuk said. “We had 20-plus guys that were just completely dialed in from the start of the day today and wanted to get that job done. There’s no secret we don’t like these guys for what happened last year. That’s human nature. Especially coming into this building where a team has not had success as of late and just really wanting to beat a team that kind of ruined our summer last year. I thought in the two games that we played them have been two of our best of the season.” Which is saying something considering the Panthers lost a pair of key forwards — Evan Rodrigues to a lower-body injury and captain Aleksander Barkov to an upper-body injury — after one period. Florida’s special teams proved to be the difference, finishing 3 of 6 with a man advantage and going in a perfect 6 for 6 on the penalty kill. “It’s just the mindset of our team, just playing as hard as you can for the guy next to you, especially down two forwards, it was a big performance from all 10 of us that were able to pull through,” Tkachuk added. Pavel Dorofeyev scored for Vegas, which has lost six of its last seven. Knights goaltender Logan Thompson made 32 saves but continues to struggle for wins, as he’s lost three of his last four starts and 11 of 17 after opening the season 5-0. Thompson has now allowed three or more goals in six of his last eight starts. “Tonight we weren’t a great team defensively, some net-front goals against, we got to take care of those,” Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. “The lack of winning affects everybody, goaltender more so than most, because he’s the last line of defense. But I think everyone could start to lose some confidence or question things when you don’t win.” Thompson’s confidence might have been boosted early after captain Mark Stone’s initial shot was blocked but Dorofeyev was there to slam the rebound into an open net. It was the start Vegas needed to shake off Monday’s shutout loss at Seattle in the Winter Classic, as it dominated the action over the first eight minutes of the game. But a penalty on William Carrier shifted momentum to Florida when Bennett one-timed a rebound off the end boards for the Panthers’ first power-play goal of the night. They’d get another midway through the second when Tkachuk’s redirect off Brandon Montour’s shot from the point slipped past Thompson. Verhaeghe silenced the crowd with a little more than a minute left in the period when he pounced on a loose rebound to the left of Thompson and notched his 20th of the season. Reinhart scored his 25th goal of the season on a power play in the third when he one-timed a pass from Tkachuk from the slot to provide the final margin.

"Welcome to the first week of 2024. You now have to read dozens — maybe hundreds! — of emails “circling back” after the holidays. Your boss and colleagues are inundating you with inquiries on your plans for the year. No pressure, right? Productivity experts say the new year is a good time to take a moment before the hustle and bustle to reset at work. So take a breath before you dive back in. Welcome to the first week of 2024. You now have to read dozens — maybe hundreds! — of emails “circling back” after the holidays. Your boss and colleagues are inundating you with inquiries on your plans for the year. No pressure, right? Productivity experts say the new year is a good time to take a moment before the hustle and bustle to reset at work. So take a breath before you dive back in. The new year offers workers a reference point in which they can evaluate what went well, what went poorly, what they want and how to plan for progress, experts say. It may be just as important as, if not more important than, setting personal health goals as most workers spend the majority of their waking hours at their jobs. “It’s important to take the time to assess the past year and look forward,” said Jono Luk, vice president of product management at Webex by Cisco. “It’s so easy to jump back to that same clip and pace” you had before. Making meaningful change doesn’t have to be overwhelming, difficult or even massive, experts say. Even small tweaks can make big differences in how someone works. “I’m a big believer in making small, incremental changes,” said Joshua Zerkel, a productivity expert and head of global engagement marketing at Asana. “It’s never a good idea to upend everything.” Here are 13 ways workers can set themselves up for success at the beginning of the year. The pandemic   in recent years, Luk said, so it might be a good time to reinforce boundaries, which could look like anything from ensuring you have a dedicated workspace to resetting your schedule. “Share your goals and boundaries with others,” he said. “So something like, ‘If you see me online at 7 p.m., kick me off.’ Others will hold you accountable.” One way to think about your goals is to remember what you’ve accomplished and apply that to what you want to do in the future, said Akhila Satish, CEO of Meseekna, a tech company that uses simulations to aid with talent assessment. Try to make your goals as actionable as possible with small time frames to make them achievable, she said. You may need to gather feedback to help you, said Anita Williams Woolley, professor and associate dean of research at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business. She also suggests spending a little time every day or week to review your activities and align them with your goals. “Be intentional and specific on what you need to be doing so you make progress,” she said. What’s urgent may not always be what’s important, Woolley said, so make sure you understand your priorities. Once you’ve done that, you can map out specifically what you plan to do and repeat until you create new habits. That may look like adding calendar items to block out times to focus on specific tasks. “Focus on things that are important,” she said. “Don’t let them get derailed by non-important, urgent things.” Make your commitments and intentions for the year known, experts say. Sharing your thoughts may be helpful for the rest of your team, who may have input or need to adjust their expectations. “It might reduce the number of things that could derail you,” Woolley said. “And if you make a public commitment, you’re more likely to do it.” Look at your calendar and assess when you were most productive and when you were least, Satish said. Doing so may reveal trends in when you’re most and least productive so that you can structure future meetings and focus times around that. You also should review which calendar items are worth keeping, Luk said. That may mean auditing recurring meetings to shorten, cancel or reformat them into emails or other forms of communication, Zerkel said. “It turns out most people could eliminate 25 percent of what they do without any impact on productivity,” said Harry Kraemer, clinical professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “We do some things only because that’s the way we’ve always done them.” Consider how you spend the 168 hours that you get every week, Kraemer said. Break down the percentage of time you want to spend across six areas: career and continuous education, family and friends, spiritual and religious perspectives, health, fun and social responsibility. Then compare that with how much time you’re actually spending and adjust accordingly, he said. “We have this bizarre concept of multitasking,” he said. “But have we confused activity with productivity?” Saving time might be as simple as copying and pasting a commonly needed email response from your laptop’s notepad, Satish said. But are there other programs or ways you can digitize small tasks to improve your workflow? Zerkel said you might even need to reduce your digital tool set to be more effective. Instead of working out of your inbox, for example, there might be a work management system that makes more sense for teams to use on specific projects for which they may want to chat, share resources or set deadlines. Start planning your time off now, even if it’s a vague estimate, Luk advised. If you know you want to take a beach trip in summer, pick a couple of ideal weekends and mark them on your calendar to ensure planning doesn’t get past you. Then, as you get closer, you can solidify your plans. “If you don’t at least write it down, you’re not going to get it done,” he said. The new year is a great time to reconnect with your professional network, Satish said. So take some time to contact former mentors and connections. “It’s hard [to keep in touch] during the year,” she said. “But it’s really easy to re-engage with a ‘happy new year’ message.” The turn of the year is a good time to ensure your  , Satish said. “You never know when you’re going to need it.” If you’ve been working with default notification settings on your devices and apps, you’re probably getting hit all day with distractions, Zerkel said. Satish suggests setting focus and work mode settings on iPhones and Android devices to filter out noise. You can also set time limits for each app under Screen Time on iOS, she added. This also may mean shutting down your email, or   or Teams notifications for focus time, Woolley said. You should organize not only your physical workspace, but also your digital one, experts say. That means cleaning up your desktop, moving icons for apps or documents you regularly need to convenient spots, archiving projects and  , Woolley said. “Clear out the gunk, so you can get to things that are more important,” Zerkel said. “It may make you feel better.” Start your day or week by spending the first 15 minutes going through your inbox, calendar and other communications and creating a priority list for important work, Zerkel said. “You can put yourself back in the driver’s seat by giving yourself a little space at the beginning of each day,” he said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63RTOGXDAFCAJKQ4TKT5SPHS6Q.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63RTOGXDAFCAJKQ4TKT5SPHS6Q.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63RTOGXDAFCAJKQ4TKT5SPHS6Q.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63RTOGXDAFCAJKQ4TKT5SPHS6Q.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63RTOGXDAFCAJKQ4TKT5SPHS6Q.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63RTOGXDAFCAJKQ4TKT5SPHS6Q.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/11/work-tips-new-year/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 10:28:00,

Trump   on Wednesday to reject the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision. A decision by Maine’s secretary of state to disallow Trump, on the heels of Colorado’s ruling, injected urgency into the question of whether the high court will ultimately decide the issue of Trump’s qualification for office under the 14th Amendment. Conventional wisdom has it that a conservative-leaning Supreme Court featuring three Trump nominees would reject the premise for disqualification, allowing his name to remain on the ballots. Not everyone takes that outcome for granted —  , according to the New York Times’s Maggie Haberman. Here are some of the other ways that legal scholars suggest a Supreme Court ruling could go. Perhaps the most prominent figure suggesting the court could shock the political world is J. Michael Luttig, a renowned conservative former federal appeals court judge turned prominent Trump critic. When the Colorado Supreme Court broke ground by kicking Trump off the state’s primary ballot last month, Luttig called the decision “ .” (Three of seven justices dissented, but mostly  , which is outside the U.S. Supreme Court’s purview. The others disqualified Trump for violating the 14th Amendment’s ban on officials who “shall have engaged in insurrection.”) Luttig also predicted that the U.S. Supreme Court would affirm Colorado’s ruling. And he hasn’t changed his mind. “If the Supreme Court takes the Colorado Supreme Court case, I believe it will affirm that court’s decision to disqualify the former president from the state’s primary ballot,” he said this week. Others are less sanguine about the prospect of the court’s ruling against Trump but suggest it’s possible. UCLA law professor Rick Hasen called it “not at all legally far-fetched for the court to disqualify Trump.” Hasen cited the paper that spurred efforts to disqualify Trump, written by the conservative legal scholars  , whose “scholarship is often looked at by the conservative originalists on the Supreme Court,” Hasen said. Another scholar who has examined the 14th Amendment argument in detail, even before it became more relevant post-Jan. 6, is University of Maryland law professor Mark A. Graber. He published a book on the subject last year titled “Punish Treason, Reward Loyalty.” “Given how strong the historical evidence is, I think disqualification has a puncher’s chance at the Supreme Court,” Graber said, “but no more.” He said that “this is a court that either uses originalism selectively or invents history.” Still others echo the assertion that the evidence is strong but say they don’t have confidence that the court will necessarily follow it — or even decide the central issue of whether Trump engaged in insurrection. “I think the case for upholding the disqualifications is kind of a straightforward legal one,” said University of Michigan law professor Leah Litman. The fact that many prognosticators assume the court will nonetheless rule for Trump “is a sign that most people understand that the justices/court don’t just decide these cases based on ‘the law,’” she added. For Vanderbilt University law professor Suzanna Sherry, the problem is this: “The justices do not want to decide this case. If they can find any way to avoid doing so, they will. If they can kick the can down the road until after November, when it will become moot, they might do that.” Indeed, there are   the court could take that fall short of disqualifying Trump from the presidency or even deciding whether he engaged in insurrection. It could decline to rule expeditiously, which would leave that central question in limbo but could effectively keep Trump on the ballot in both Colorado and Maine. (Both states’ decisions are stayed pending appeals.) It could rule that states are allowed to remove Trump from the  ballot under their interpretations of the 14th Amendment but stop short of applying that to the more consequential general election ballot. (Luttig’s prediction notably applies to the primary ballot.) Some of those who say the Supreme Court could surprise us have cited now-Justice Neil M. Gorsuch’s related , which those who disqualified Trump in Colorado and Maine also referenced. Gorsuch, in that  cited “a state’s legitimate interest in protecting the integrity and practical functioning of the political process,” which “permits it to exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.” Perhaps the most popular theory is that the court will punt. That could involve saying that Trump must first be convicted of insurrection, saying the 14th Amendment isn’t self-executing (in other words, Congress must pass a law detailing how it is to be enforced), or doing what a Denver district judge initially did and ruling that the 14th Amendment doesn’t apply to presidents. University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck suggested in a column that the court could echo that judge in another way: by keeping Trump on the ballot citing one of the above reasons but also  , an outcome Vladeck called “ ” in such a fraught case. “The court won’t be keeping Trump off the ballot, but it won’t be endorsing his candidacy, either,” Vladeck wrote. “If anything, having Republican appointees joining Democratic appointees in holding that Trump did engage in insurrection might go a long way toward persuading those who are capable of being persuaded to cast their vote for someone else.” As Vladeck’s column suggests, the politics of this aren’t so simple — even if they’re a consideration for the justices. Yes, the court leans conservative, and conservatives in the United States are overwhelmingly in Trump’s corner. But justices present a different political proposition than elected officials. Republicans in Congress have toed Trump’s line, but often reluctantly, and often in ways that suggest there is discontent beneath the surface. Unlike those who have to worry about the next primary and their political futures, justices have lifetime appointments. There’s also a case to be made that disqualifying Trump might actually be  for the conservative movement, by taking a flawed candidate out of the picture. “If they think Republicans have a better chance with Trump off the ballot, they will affirm,” Sherry predicted. “If they think Republicans have a better chance with Trump on the ballot, they will reverse.” Such a calculation might be more nuanced.  The court might also fear a backlash from Trump supporters for taking the huge step of disqualifying a candidate supported by tens of millions of Americans. But the justices would also be more insulated from that backlash than your average official. And Hasen argued that we shouldn’t assume they feel some kind of loyalty to Trump. “I think there’s no love lost between Trump and many of the conservatives on the Supreme Court,” Hasen said. “Some may think they’d be doing the Republican Party a favor to get rid of Trump, to the extent they think in any purely partisan calculation.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4JFYWQX6YI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4JFYWQX6YI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4JFYWQX6YI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4JFYWQX6YI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4JFYWQX6YI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/G4JFYWQX6YI6XC62QFGKK3QTRM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/04/could-supreme-court-actually-disqualify-trump/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 10:46:00,
"It turns out the Washington Commanders’ season finale actually does matter. Quite a bit, too. A week after the San Francisco 49ers celebrated their No. 1 seed and first-round bye in the visiting locker room at FedEx Field, the Dallas Cowboys could hold their own celebration Sunday night if they come away with a win. It turns out the Washington Commanders’ season finale actually does matter. Quite a bit, too. A week after the San Francisco 49ers celebrated their No. 1 seed and first-round bye in the visiting locker room at FedEx Field, the Dallas Cowboys could hold their own celebration Sunday night if they come away with a win. A Dallas victory would clinch the NFC East title. And the Commanders have plenty at stake, too — through not for the current regime. A teardown and rebuild are ahead for Washington, and a loss to Dallas would help its odds of picking second in April’s draft. Here are some numbers worth knowing ahead of the Commanders’ final game. As of Thursday, the Commanders have a   holding on to the No. 2 pick in the draft and an   of falling to No. 3. Consider it the silver lining of a lost season. Washington, New England (currently No. 3) and Arizona (No. 4) are  , but Washington has a higher draft slot because of its strength of schedule, the first tiebreaker. Entering Week 18, the Commanders’ average opponent winning percentage (.515) is worse than the other two teams in contention for the second pick but only marginally worse than New England’s (.518). Because strength of schedule fluctuates each week, Washington (assuming it loses to Dallas) could need help from other teams — including Pittsburgh, Houston, New Orleans, Green Bay and Las Vegas — to keep the No. 2 pick if the Patriots lose to the New York Jets. The Atlanta-New Orleans game would matter most. The Commanders defeated the Falcons in Week 6, and the Patriots lost to the Saints in Week 5. Should the Falcons win in New Orleans, they would knock Washington out of the No. 2 spot. Terry McLaurin needs 54 receiving yards to become the first receiver in franchise history to have four consecutive seasons with at least 1,000. Gary Clark and Art Monk are the only receivers in Washington history to have at least four seasons (nonconsecutive) of 1,000-plus yards. They each had five. What makes McLaurin’s feat especially impressive is he has recorded such numbers while playing with 11 quarterbacks in his five seasons in the NFL. He has caught a pass from 10 of them, not including his 28-yard catch from tight end Logan Thomas on a trick play against the Cowboys in 2020. Terry McLaurin needs 54 rec. yds Sunday to become the first WR in Washington history to have four consecutive 1,000-yard seasons.  He's played with 11 different QBs and caught at least 1 pass from 10 of them (not incl. his 28-yd catch from Logan Thomas on a trick play in '20).  The Commanders have failed to get the production and consistency they’ve needed from their draft picks, this season especially. Cornerback Emmanuel Forbes Jr. hasn’t played to the level most would expect from a first-round pick and was benched earlier in the season. He also missed time with an elbow injury. Third-round center Ricky Stromberg was injured in Week 4, and fourth-round tackle Braeden Daniels was placed on injured reserve before the season. Fifth-rounder KJ Henry and seventh-rounder Andre Jones Jr. got more playing time at defensive end following the trades of Chase Young and Montez Sweat, but neither is polished or consistent enough to solidify a roster spot next season. And sixth-round running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. showed the potential to be a reliable back, but his time was limited, and an ankle injury cut his season short. Second-round defensive back Quan Martin has shown the greatest progress, with big plays, versatility and a clearer understanding of the defense. Looking at the bigger picture: Only two of the 15 players the Commanders drafted in the past two years are on track to play a full 17-game slate since entering the league: receiver Jahan Dotson and quarterback Sam Howell. Dotson missed time last season because of injury, and Howell appeared only in Week 18. Should both play Sunday, they’ll be the first among either draft class to see the field for a full season.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECQXGGUOPJHWBJFL4DTHQRQGFE_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECQXGGUOPJHWBJFL4DTHQRQGFE_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECQXGGUOPJHWBJFL4DTHQRQGFE_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECQXGGUOPJHWBJFL4DTHQRQGFE_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECQXGGUOPJHWBJFL4DTHQRQGFE_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ECQXGGUOPJHWBJFL4DTHQRQGFE_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/commanders-cowboys-stats-preview/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 17:42:00,

LOS ANGELES — Robby Fabbri scored twice, Lucas Raymond and Patrick Kane converted in the shootout and the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Los Angeles Kings 4-3 on Thursday night. Fabbri’s second two-goal game of the season helped Detroit snap a six-game losing streak to Los Angeles. Jeff Petry also scored for the Red Wings and Daniel Sprong had a pair of assists. Alex Lyon made 40 saves. Detroit trailed 2-0 less than five minutes in, then rallied for its third victory in four games. “I think they woke us up a little bit, got us on our game and we saw that made us successful there in the second period. And we kept it going,” Fabbri said. Adrian Kempe had his second two-goal game in eight days, but it wasn’t enough as the Kings lost their fourth straight. Kempe has eight points in the last six games. “At the end of the night, we’re kind of disappointed just leaving with one point. I think we played good enough to win,” Kempe said. “Some games are going to be tighter, and it’s the tight games we want to win. It’s the tight games you have to win.” Matt Roy scored his first goal this season for Los Angeles. Alex Laferriere and Pierre-Luc Dubois assisted on both of Kempe’s goals. David Rittich stopped 23 shots. Detroit is 2-0 in shootouts this season, while Los Angeles is 1-4. “Shootouts not treating us real well right now,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “We’re not getting any saves and we’re not scoring goals, so the combination of those two things are a disaster in the shootout.” Kempe got the Kings on the board 1:10 into the game when he put the puck between Lyon’s legs from in front after getting a great pass from Laferriere. Kempe also tied it 3-all at 15:43 of the third period with a snap shot from the slot. Roy doubled the Los Angeles lead at 4:18 of the first when he knocked in a rebound after Lyon made a pad save on Anze Kopitar’s shot. It was Roy’s first goal in 56 games dating to last season. Detroit responded with a pair of second-period goals to tie it after 40 minutes. Fabbri won a battle in front at 9:59, and Petry made it 2-all at 17:21 with a slap shot from the right point. Both his goals this season have come in his last seven games. Fabbri gave the Red Wings a 3-2 lead at 5:24 of the third, putting in a rebound after Rittich made a blocker save on Sprong’s shot from the left circle. “It was not a very good first period by us. For us to play that poorly in the first period and to bounce back like that in the second against a very good team, it’s a quality win for us,” Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said. Kane scored his 51st career shootout goal and is one behind former Chicago teammate Jonathan Toews for the most in NHL history.

"The D.C. Council will probably vote next week on a measure that would allow it to file a lawsuit or join in other litigation against Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s administration over its refusal to implement the council’s $40 million budget directive to increase food assistance to thousands of D.C. residents. The threat of legal action is an escalation in the weeks-long feud between Bowser (D) and the council over a measure to enhance D.C.'s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by 10 percent from January to September, which was contingent on the city having enough excess revenue at the end of the last fiscal year. The D.C. Council will probably vote next week on a measure that would allow it to file a lawsuit or join in other litigation against Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s administration over its refusal to implement the council’s $40 million budget directive to increase food assistance to thousands of D.C. residents. The threat of legal action is an escalation in the weeks-long feud between Bowser (D) and the council over a measure to enhance D.C.'s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by 10 percent from January to September, which was contingent on the city having enough excess revenue at the end of the last fiscal year. But even after the city’s chief financial officer certified the excess funds in the fall, Bowser administration officials have said the Department of Human Services (DHS), which is facilitating several over-budget social services programs with high demand and urgent needs, would not be able to implement the boost because of  . Last month, the council in a letter urged Bowser to “reconsider the decision to disregard District law,” and move forward with the plan that would benefit 140,000 residents who were expecting their aid to increase this month. The letter noted that D.C. had the slowest rate in the country for processing SNAP applications in fiscal 2022, second only to Guam, while suggesting that DHS had not filled staffing positions funded by the council in last year’s budget. Lawmakers have also pointed to a Dec. 13 opinion from the office of D.C.’s attorney general that   on whether Bowser’s office could repurpose the nearly $40 million that was legislatively mandated to go toward SNAP. But with the future of the enhanced benefit still uncertain Tuesday, Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) filed notice of a resolution that would grant the council’s general counsel the authority to initiate legal action or intervene in another case involving the SNAP increase; last week, Mendelson said some area nonprofits have hinted that they might sue over the stalled benefits. The council will probably consider the resolution at its Jan. 9 legislative meeting. Mendelson said he and other lawmakers with concerns about SNAP are still scheduled to  the day before to discuss a potential path forward — including finding a way to reduce DHS’s spending pressures without using the millions intended for the SNAP boost. “My ideal would be that we go forward with the SNAP-enhanced benefits as soon as possible, and that the other spending issues that the mayor has identified have a solution,” Mendelson said of the meeting. “The SNAP money was clearly and precisely appropriated without ambiguity — and the case law is very clear that there’s not discretion — so let’s talk and see how we can deal with this range of issues.” Mendelson said Tuesday that the resolution was primarily intended to protect the council’s appropriation authority. He acknowledged that it’s likely that DHS’s challenges might be too complicated to work out in one day, and said that even if the meeting is positive, it’s likely the resolution will remain on the council’s agenda for a vote. “But that doesn’t mean that we will be in court the next day. I’m hopeful we will never go to court over this and it will get worked out,” Mendelson said. In a statement late Tuesday, Bowser’s office reiterated the fiscal constraints facing the DHS and said it hoped to work with the council toward a more sustainable way to boost food assistance for residents in need. “With significant fiscal and human resources pressures in our human services cluster, it’s not prudent to increase spending on one program, especially when demand for other programs that support the same people is increasing beyond our current budget,” the statement said. “As our budgets tighten, we have a responsibility to first fund and sustain critical housing, shelter, and the cash and food assistance benefits already in place.” A spokesman for the D.C. attorney general’s office, which has a statutory obligation to represent the city in lawsuits brought against the District, also declined to comment on any potential litigation (though rare, D.C.’s attorney general   in specific legal matters, asking them to seek outside counsel instead). Several lawmakers and advocacy groups have decried the Bowser administration’s rationale around not implementing the SNAP increase. Advocates disrupted the mayor’s remarks Monday during the annual  , and last month projected a message onto the Wilson Building. Council member Robert C. White Jr. (D-At Large) said in a statement Tuesday that he and other council members “were concerned about the mayor’s pattern of taking from safety net programs to pay for her pet priorities.” Two months ago, White recalled, the council blocked Bowser’s attempt to redirect $20 million that had been set aside for the city’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program to replenish funds for a separate program, for families experiencing homelessness. White, who chairs the housing committee, oversees both DHS-led programs. “I had conversations over the holiday with Chairman Mendelson about legal options to compel the mayor to follow the law, and I fully support his resolution authorizing a lawsuit,” White wrote. The last time D.C. lawmakers sued the mayor was , when the council sued Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) and Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey DeWitt during a dispute over budget autonomy. A year before, District voters approved a referendum that allowed the city to spend locally raised funds without a congressional appropriation. Gray and DeWitt had argued that the measure had no legal effect and instead violated Congress’s constitutional authority over the District. In 2016, after the suit had been tied up in court for years, a D.C. Superior Court judge sided with voters determining that the council, and not Congress, has the power to control locally raised dollars. By then, Bowser had become mayor and  from Gray’s position, siding with the council. A previous version of this article said that advocates disrupted the mayor's remarks on Thursday during the annual Bowser-administration-led 5K run. The event was on Monday. The article has been corrected.

"North Korea’s military fired about 200 shells near two South Korean islands in the Yellow Sea on Friday morning, forcing residents to take cover in nearby bomb shelters, South Korean officials said. No one was hurt, the South’s military said. The North Korean rounds — fired between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. local time near the South Korean islands of Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong — fell into the waters north of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime border between the two Koreas in the Yellow Sea. North Korea’s military fired about 200 shells near two South Korean islands in the Yellow Sea on Friday morning, forcing residents to take cover in nearby bomb shelters, South Korean officials said.

The North Korean rounds — fired between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. local time near the South Korean islands of Baengnyeong and Yeonpyeong — fell into the waters north of the Northern Limit Line, the de facto maritime border between the two Koreas in the Yellow Sea. South Korean marines responded by conducting afternoon live-fire drills in the Yellow Sea, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said in a news release. Yeonpyeong, located less than 10 miles from the North Korean coastline, was the site of a deadly North Korean surprise attack in 2010, when Pyongyang launched scores of shells. Four people, including two South Korean marines serving on the island, were killed. Col. Lee Sung-jun, a spokesman for the South’s armed forces, demanded that the North “immediately cease” actions that increase tensions, reading aloud a prepared statement. Hundreds of civilians living on Yeonpyeong had entered bomb shelters, an official at the county office said. A total of 2,100 people live there, the official said, including the family members of the marines assigned to the island’s garrison. The 4,800 residents of Baengnyeong had also been ordered into bomb shelters, a South Korean official there said. The sheltering orders were lifted at 3:45 p.m. local time, the two officials said. The development reflects North Korea’s goal of raising regional tensions, Lee said. “The responsibility for this heightened state of tensions lies completely with North Korea,” he added. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has consistently vowed to continue upgrading his nuclear arsenal and military since rising to power more than a decade ago. In a statement published by state media late last year, Kim said his soldiers would accelerate efforts to “subdue the entire territory of the South in case of war,” using “all physical means” including nuclear weapons. A South Korean army brigade conducted a days-long exercise this week with elements of the U.S. Army’s 2nd Infantry Division,  . The U.S. military maintains 28,500 troops in the South, primarily to deter North Korea, and conducts routine training and field exercises with South Korean soldiers. The North regularly denounces those drills.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2EJT3AGO5Y6PFHCESCM7LJ4Z5E.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2EJT3AGO5Y6PFHCESCM7LJ4Z5E.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2EJT3AGO5Y6PFHCESCM7LJ4Z5E.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2EJT3AGO5Y6PFHCESCM7LJ4Z5E.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2EJT3AGO5Y6PFHCESCM7LJ4Z5E.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2EJT3AGO5Y6PFHCESCM7LJ4Z5E.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/05/north-korea-attack-south-korea-island-shelters/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 06:53:00,
"There are few defenses from White people against allegations of racial insensitivity more notorious than “I have Black friends.” There was perhaps a time when this was compelling, a demonstration of familiarity with Black culture and Black people that would effectively blunt such criticism. But it is easy to see why, particularly these days, it generally isn’t. “Friend” is a malleable term; it’s very easy (and probably common) for one person’s “friend” to be another person’s “acquaintance.” More to the point, the invocation has become, through overuse, a far more reliable indicator of myopia about Black culture than of familiarity with it. There are few defenses from White people against allegations of racial insensitivity more notorious than “I have Black friends.” There was perhaps a time when this was compelling, a demonstration of familiarity with Black culture and Black people that would effectively blunt such criticism. But it is easy to see why, particularly these days, it generally isn’t. “Friend” is a malleable term; it’s very easy (and probably common) for one person’s “friend” to be another person’s “acquaintance.” More to the point, the invocation has become, through overuse, a far more reliable indicator of myopia about Black culture than of familiarity with it. We might consider this when evaluating former ambassador Nikki Haley’s defense of her past failure to identify slavery as the central cause of the Civil War when asked about that failure during a CNN town hall Thursday night. “If you grow up in South Carolina,” she said, arguing that she simply assumed that slavery’s role was obvious, “literally in second and third grade, you learn about slavery. You grow up and you have — you know, I had Black friends growing up. It is a very talked-about thing.” She made a similar comment later in the town hall, again noting her Black friends. “It was not just slavery that was talked about,” Haley said. “It was more about racism that was talked about. It was more about, you know, we had friends, we had Black friends, we had White friends. But it was always a topic of conversation, even among our friends.” You see how Haley deploys these friendships: She was necessarily intimately familiar with the subject because of them. (Speaking to the Des Moines Register on Friday, Haley   her invocation of those friendships as “a source of pride.”) But let’s set that aside and consider a related question: How many people of all backgrounds have Black friends? This is harder to answer than it may seem. Pollsters don’t often ask specifically about the diversity of Americans’ social relationships, probably in part because the responses could be subject to the same sort of   — overstatement of those relationships — that might give us pause when such friendships are invoked as a defense. There is   polling about it, though. In 2013, for example, Reuters   the results of a poll conducted by Ipsos. “About 40 percent of white Americans and about 25 percent of non-white Americans are surrounded exclusively by friends of their own race,” Reuters’s Lindsay Dunsmuir wrote. This wasn’t uniform across the country, the poll found. While interracial friendships were more common on the West Coast, “the South has the lowest percentage of people with more than five acquaintances from races that don’t reflect their own.” Haley’s home state of South Carolina, as you are likely aware, is in the South. This doesn’t quite answer our question (plus we’d ideally like polling that’s less than a decade old). So we can instead consider PRRI’s   of the social bubbles in which Americans live. PRRI found that, overall, Americans reported that about two-thirds of their friendship networks were White, and that about 11 percent of those networks were Black. (The method of identifying these networks is   but centers on respondents being asked about people with whom they discussed important issues.) Those percentages also vary based on other factors. Black Americans are more likely to have more Black friends (with Black Americans identifying about 8 in 10 friends as Black). This pattern holds for other groups, too; most of the friendship networks of Asian/Pacific Islander Americans are made up of Asian/Pacific Islanders. Among White Americans, though, the percentage of same-race friends is higher, with 90 percent of White friendship networks being identified as White. Non-White respondents were more likely to identify Whites as members of their friendship networks than Whites were to identify non-White friends, or than non-Whites were to identify members of other non-White groups in the aggregate. Among Hispanics, for example, 7 percent of friendship networks were Black, Asian or multiracial, compared with 26 percent White. This is certainly in large part because Whites make up the majority of the American population. As with the Reuters research, PRRI found that White respondents were more likely to have friendship networks that were entirely White than other racial groups were to have friendship networks including only people from their own race. PRRI also found that Republicans were more likely to have all-White friendship networks than were Democrats. Among all Republicans, their friendship networks were 83 percent White on average, compared with 53 percent among Democrats. Among White Democrats, friendship networks were 90 percent White on average. Over time, the biennial General Social Survey (GSS) has   an increase in the percentage of Americans who report living in racially diverse neighborhoods (at least in terms of White-Black diversity). In 1980, a five-year average of GSS data showed that less than half of Americans reported living in a neighborhood with members of a different race. In 2022, the average was 8 in 10. From the outset, though, there’s been a gap between Democrats and Republicans, overlapping in part with the higher density of Democrats in more-populous and more-diverse cities. For   I analyzed Census Bureau data to find that Whites were more likely than other groups to live in census tracts (neighborhoods, in essence) that were at least 85 percent composed of members of their own race. In urban areas, about 10 percent of Whites lived in tracts that were 85 percent White. In rural areas, 60 percent of Whites did. This is still not quite getting at the question posed by Haley’s remarks. How many Americans have friends who are Black? Among non-Blacks, it seems, the best we can answer is: relatively few. Among Asian Americans (the group into which Haley falls, given her Indian heritage), only 2 percent of friendship networks were Black. It’s worth noting another constraint on her comments: She mentioned having Black friends only when she was a kid.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TXET7HGON3XHAZ4NEU2A53HFE.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TXET7HGON3XHAZ4NEU2A53HFE.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TXET7HGON3XHAZ4NEU2A53HFE.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TXET7HGON3XHAZ4NEU2A53HFE.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TXET7HGON3XHAZ4NEU2A53HFE.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6TXET7HGON3XHAZ4NEU2A53HFE.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/how-many-americans-actually-have-black-friends/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 17:15:00,
"If a media outlet copied a bunch of New York Times stories and posted them on its site, that would probably be seen as a blatant violation of the Times’s copyright. But what about when a tech company copies those same articles, combines them with countless other copied works, and uses them to train an AI chatbot capable of conversing on almost any topic — including the ones it learned about from the Times? If a media outlet copied a bunch of New York Times stories and posted them on its site, that would probably be seen as a blatant violation of the Times’s copyright. But what about when a tech company copies those same articles, combines them with countless other copied works, and uses them to train an AI chatbot capable of conversing on almost any topic — including the ones it learned about from the Times? That’s the legal question at the heart of a lawsuit   in federal court last week, alleging that the tech firms illegally used “millions” of copyrighted Times articles to help develop the AI models behind tools such as ChatGPT and Bing. It’s the latest, and some believe the strongest, in a bevy of active lawsuits alleging that various tech and artificial intelligence companies have violated the intellectual property of media companies, photography sites, book authors and artists. Together, the cases have the potential to rattle the foundations of the booming generative AI industry, some legal experts say — but they could also fall flat. That’s because the tech firms are likely to lean heavily on a legal concept that has served them well in the past: the doctrine known as “fair use.” Broadly speaking, copyright law distinguishes between ripping off someone else’s work verbatim — which is generally illegal — and “remixing” or putting it to a new, creative use. What is confounding about AI systems, said James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and information law at Cornell University, is that in this case they seem to be doing both. Generative AI represents “this big technological transformation that can make a remixed version of anything,” Grimmelmann said. “The challenge is that these models can also blatantly memorize works they were trained on, and often produce near-exact copies,” which, he said, is “traditionally the heart of what copyright law prohibits.” From the first VCRs, which could be used to record TV shows and movies, to Google Books, which digitized millions of books, U.S. companies have convinced courts that their technological tools amounted to fair use of copyrighted works. OpenAI and Microsoft are already mounting a similar defense. “We believe that the training of AI models qualifies as a fair use, falling squarely in line with established precedents recognizing that the use of copyrighted materials by technology innovators in transformative ways is entirely consistent with copyright law,” OpenAI wrote in a   in November. AI systems are typically “trained” on gargantuan data sets that include vast amounts of published material, much of it copyrighted. Through this training, they come to recognize patterns in the arrangement of words and pixels, which they can then draw on to assemble plausible prose and images in response to just about any prompt. Some AI enthusiasts view this process as a form of learning, not unlike an art student devouring books on Monet or a news junkie reading the Times cover-to-cover to develop their own expertise. But plaintiffs see a more quotidian process at work beneath these models’ hood: It’s a form of copying, and unauthorized copying at that. “It’s not learning the facts like a brain would learn facts,” said Danielle Coffey, chief executive of the News/Media Alliance, a trade group that represents more than 2,000 media organizations, including the Times and The Washington Post. “It’s literally spitting the words back out at you.” There are two main prongs to the New York Times’s case against OpenAI and Microsoft. First, like other recent AI copyright lawsuits, the Times argues that its rights were infringed when its articles were “scraped” — or digitally scanned and copied — for inclusion in the giant data sets that GPT-4 and other AI models were trained on. That’s sometimes called the “input” side. Second, the Times’s lawsuit cites examples in which OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model — versions of which power both ChatGPT and Bing — appeared to cough up either detailed summaries of paywalled articles, like the company’s Wirecutter product reviews, or entire sections of specific Times articles. In other words, the Times alleges, the tools violated its copyright with their “output,” too. Judges so far have been wary of the argument that training an AI model on copyrighted works — the “input” side — amounts to a violation in itself, said Jason Bloom, a partner at the law firm Haynes and Boone and the chairman of its intellectual property litigation group. “Technically, doing that can be copyright infringement, but it’s more likely to be considered fair use, based on precedent, because you’re not publicly displaying the work when you’re just ingesting and training” with it, Bloom said. (Bloom is not involved in any of the active AI copyright suits.) Fair use also can apply when the copying is done for a purpose different from simply reproducing the original work — such as to critique it or to use it for research or educational purposes, like a teacher photocopying a news article to hand out to a journalism class. That’s how Google defended Google Books, an ambitious project to scan and digitize millions of copyrighted books from public and academic libraries so that it could make their contents searchable online. The project sparked a 2005 lawsuit by the Authors Guild, which called it a “brazen violation of copyright law.” But Google argued that because it displayed only “snippets” of the books in response to searches, it wasn’t undermining the market for books but providing a fundamentally different service. In 2015, a federal appellate court  . That precedent should work in favor of OpenAI, Microsoft and other tech firms, said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law and co-director of its High Tech Law Institute. “I’m going to take the position, based on precedent, that if the outputs aren’t infringing, then anything that took place before isn’t infringing as well,” Goldman said. “Show me that the output is infringing. If it’s not, then copyright case over.” OpenAI and Microsoft are also the subject of other AI copyright lawsuits, as are rival AI firms including Meta, Stability AI and Midjourney, with some targeting text-based chatbots and others targeting image generators. So far, judges have   in which the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the AI’s outputs were substantially similar to their copyrighted works. In contrast, the Times’s suit   in which a version of GPT-4 reproduced large passages of text identical to that in Times articles in response to certain prompts. That could go a long way with a jury, should the case get that far, said Blake Reid, associate professor at Colorado Law. But if courts find that only those specific outputs are infringing, and not the use of the copyrighted material for training, he added, that could prove much easier for the tech firms to fix. OpenAI’s position is that the examples in the Times’s lawsuit are aberrations — a sort of bug in the system that caused it to cough up passages verbatim. Tom Rubin, OpenAI’s chief of intellectual property and content, said the Times appears to have intentionally manipulated its prompts to the AI system to get it to reproduce its training data. He said via email that the examples in the lawsuit “are not reflective of intended use or normal user behavior and violate our terms of use.” “Many of their examples are not replicable today,” Rubin added, “and we continually make our products more resilient to this type of misuse.” The Times isn’t the only organization that has found AI systems producing outputs that resemble copyrighted works. A lawsuit filed by Getty Images against Stability AI notes examples of its Stable Diffusion image generator reproducing the Getty watermark. And a recent blog post by AI expert Gary Marcus shows examples in which Microsoft’s Image Creator appeared to generate   from movies and TV shows. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. The Times did not specify the amount it is seeking, although the company estimates damages to be in the “billions.” It is also asking for a permanent ban on the unlicensed use of its work. More dramatically, it asks that any existing AI models trained on Times content be destroyed. Because the AI cases represent new terrain in copyright law, it is not clear how judges and juries will ultimately rule, several legal experts agreed. While the Google Books case might work in the tech firms’ favor, the fair-use picture was muddied by the  ’s use of a photograph of the rock star Prince, said Daniel Gervais, a professor at Vanderbilt Law and director of its intellectual property program. The court found that if the copying is done to compete with the original work, “that weighs against fair use” as a defense. So the Times’s case may hinge in part on its ability to show that products like ChatGPT and Bing compete with and harm its business. “Anyone who’s predicting the outcome is taking a big risk here,” Gervais said. He said for business plaintiffs like the New York Times, one likely outcome might be a settlement that grants the tech firms a license to the content in exchange for payment. The Times spent months in talks with OpenAI and Microsoft, which holds a major stake in OpenAI, before the newspaper sued, the Times disclosed in its lawsuit. Some media companies have already struck arrangements over the use of their content. Last month, OpenAI agreed to pay German media conglomerate Axel Springer, which publishes Business Insider and Politico, to show parts of articles in ChatGPT responses. The tech company has also struck a deal with the Associated Press for access to the news service’s archives. A Times victory could have major consequences for the news industry, which has been in crisis since the internet began to supplant newspapers and magazines nearly 20 years ago. Since then, newspaper advertising revenue has been in steady decline, the number of working journalists has dropped dramatically and hundreds of communities across the country no longer have local newspapers. But even as publishers seek payment for the use of their human-generated materials to train AI, some also are publishing works produced by AI — which has prompted both   and  . Cornell’s Grimmelmann said AI copyright cases might ultimately hinge on the stories each side tells about how to weigh the technology’s harms and benefits. “Look at all the lawsuits, and they’re trying to tell stories about how these are just plagiarism machines ripping off artists,” he said. “Look at the [AI firms’ responses], and they’re trying to tell stories about all the really interesting things these AIs can do that are genuinely new and exciting.” Reid of Colorado Law noted that tech giants may make less sympathetic defendants today for many judges and juries than they did a decade ago when the Google Books case was being decided. “There’s a reason you’re hearing a lot about innovation and open-source and start-ups” from the tech industry, he said. “There’s a race to frame who’s the David and who’s the Goliath here.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LYJ7ZKSI3AMS37BLMA2DVE5YM.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LYJ7ZKSI3AMS37BLMA2DVE5YM.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LYJ7ZKSI3AMS37BLMA2DVE5YM.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LYJ7ZKSI3AMS37BLMA2DVE5YM.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LYJ7ZKSI3AMS37BLMA2DVE5YM.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7LYJ7ZKSI3AMS37BLMA2DVE5YM.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/04/nyt-ai-copyright-lawsuit-fair-use/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 07:00:00,

For the past decade, tech companies have chased a dream: Invent a gadget to replace the smartphone. That’s why companies have created   and wrist, talking speakers for your living room and virtual reality goggles. And while lots of people love Apple Watches, Alexa speakers or   headsets, none of those have yet shoved aside the smartphone as the center of your digital life. But the dream lives on. The 2024 twist will be gadgets designed to make the most of artificial intelligence technologies like ChatGPT. Expect to hear a lot this year about  , AI devices you wear as a  ,  ,   with  ,   — and more computers for your face, wrist and   refashioned as portals to AI. These AI gadgets may become the most-talked-about technology of 2024. And AI gadgets might be the most pointless technology of the year. That wouldn’t be the worst thing. I’m snarky about AI gadgets and the hype building around them. But I also want to encourage myself and you  . There’s a lot of malarkey but also shreds of promise in trying to move beyond the smartphone. Let’s talk about what might be useful about AI gadgets and what might be hot air. The hype you’ll hear about “AI gadgets” is two distinct happenings. First, there are companies noodling on new forms of computers — like glasses, jewelry, robots or   that are supposedly tailored for AI. They’re also pitched as being less obtrusive than your phone for snapping photos, texting your new crush and asking a chatbot for shopping advice. You should expect most of these AI gadgets to be half-baked, creepy or terrible ideas — or all of the above. Take the new “ ” — that’s how the company capitalizes it. This gadget that you clip on your clothing summons a chatbot and can project the weather forecast onto your palm with lasers or something. The computer brooch from Humane costs at least $699 plus a $288 annual subscription. I have not tried the device, but it looks like a beautifully designed art piece that no normal human should buy. (Humane says that “new technologies deserve new devices.”) That probably goes, too, for the   that records everything you say and hear so an AI can replay the good parts. I’ve also heard enthusiasm in Silicon Valley about the new model of  . Former iPhone designer Jony Ive is   with Sam Altman, the  . Even Altman is cautious about AI gadgets. Most of the ideas about AI-tailored computing devices are “quite bad,” he   in an October interview with the Wall Street Journal. The problem with anything that tries to be “better” than your smartphone is that those devices are familiar, useful, ubiquitous and ingrained in your life. But it’s also fair to believe that as AI and the internet move ahead, the devices we use to access them shouldn’t stay frozen in the past. Evan Spiegel, the co-founder and CEO of Snapchat’s parent company, has been working   that   with digital images. He has been refreshingly candid about how long it will take to give you something great beyond the smartphone — and how worthwhile the hunt is. “Despite smartphones crawling into nearly every part of our lives, they still feel like they get in the way of fully experiencing the world,” Spiegel said in an email. “It’s time for something new.” Spiegel believes that the glasses his company has been slowly improving for years “will provide a more sensational computing experience that’s more easily shared with friends and grounded in the real world.” The second category of AI gadgets are smartphones,  , laptops and other devices whose innards are re-engineered to let you talk to AI chatbots, make your photos look better with AI or translate a video from Japanese faster and more easily. Expect Samsung to brag about its   coming this month, although the iPhone and   have for years been changing to take advantage of what AI can do. This kind of AI remodeling of devices you own is less flashy but potentially more useful than new AI gizmos. But, honestly, don’t pay attention to hype about AI smartphones and AI laptops. Just know that when you buy your next phone or computer, it will have more AI capabilities than your last one. Everything else is mostly hot air to try to sell you a new phone or PC or make a company seem cutting-edge. There will be so much baloney about AI gadgets that aren’t worth buying, but we shouldn’t lose sight of the dream they represent. You deserve fresh ideas for more immersive and less confining digital experiences. Lawyers working for 23andMe did something dumb.

It’s always a mistake to blame the victims of rampant cybercrime. Period.

Not good. (The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Read more from Tatum on   of the company’s computer systems. The news organization 404 Media also questioned whether  , which might be used or stolen in ways you can’t imagine. But it’s also true that you’re safer — not safe, but safer — from criminals stealing your online information or money if you use a strong, unique password for each of your digital accounts.

"In his first five months of ownership, Washington Commanders managing partner Josh Harris has avoided indicating a preference for the location of the team’s next stadium and instead focused on what seems like a simple goal. “We would love to have a stadium where the opposing players fear to come, and our fans … and our players love to come and feel welcomed,” he said in late July. “That's what I experienced at RFK [Stadium as a kid]. And whatever happens with the stadium, that's the kind of stadium experience I want to create.” In his first five months of ownership, Washington Commanders managing partner Josh Harris has avoided indicating a preference for the location of the team’s next stadium and instead focused on what seems like a simple goal. “We would love to have a stadium where the opposing players fear to come, and our fans … and our players love to come and feel welcomed,” he said in late July. “That's what I experienced at RFK [Stadium as a kid]. And whatever happens with the stadium, that's the kind of stadium experience I want to create.” But creating a home-field advantage in the modern NFL is not easy. For years,   — including sports science and the online secondary ticket market — has diminished the vaunted edge of playing at home in front of rabid fans. So even though home teams have won more since   — they are 144-112 (.563) this season, through Week 17 — it’s not necessarily because they’ve had a home-field advantage, according to three oddsmakers for major U.S. sportsbooks. “The number of teams in the NFL right now that have a real home-field advantage is very small,” John Murray, the executive director of race and sports at Westgate Las Vegas, said. Overall, it’s obvious the best way to create a home-field advantage is to attract talented personnel, build a good team and win games. And in an era of  , home edges are small but significant. Just look at how they’ve helped teams like the Dallas Cowboys, Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins and Cleveland Browns this season. For Washington, the end of this disastrous season has highlighted the strong headwinds it faces to improve at home. The Commanders have not finished .500 or better at FedEx Field since 2017, and their home point differential (minus-116) is on track to be the worst of any team since Jacksonville in 2013 (minus-127). Last week, San Francisco 49ers fans were the latest to flood FedEx, boo the home team and force the offense into silent count with chants of “DE-FENSE!” Expect more of the same Sunday in the season finale against the rival Cowboys, who are playing for the NFC East crown. Historically, oddsmakers thought playing at home was worth three points. Even into the late 2000s, Washington’s strong home crowd was “definitely” worth three or more, according to Jason McCormick, vice president of race and sports for Station Casinos. But it’s diminished greatly in recent years. “Their home-field advantage has become negligible,” McCormick said. “There’s still some home-field advantage there,” Johnny Avello, director of race and sports operations for DraftKings, said. “Maybe a point, possibly a point and a half depending on who they’re playing.” Critically for Harris, it seems difficult to manufacture an edge. Oddsmakers said the league’s two newest stadiums, in Las Vegas and Los Angeles, do not give their teams a meaningful boost. In December, the Commanders faced the Los Angeles Rams at beautiful, sterile SoFi Stadium, and afterward, several players said they didn’t feel like the crowd had given the Rams a home-field advantage. “At times, we were able to go on regular cadence,” tight end Logan Thomas said. He added: “I think a new stadium obviously would help [us], especially if it's an area where the majority of the fans are. But I think winning cures all.” “If we win, fans show up, [we] got home-field advantage,” cornerback Kendall Fuller said. McCormick argued the Commanders shouldn’t be compared to Las Vegas or Los Angeles because the Raiders, Rams and Chargers were relocated from other areas. “You still have a regional bias in the D.C. area [toward the Commanders],” he said. “If the stadium is built and they can find a way to put a winning product on the field, we know that those people want to be Commander fans.” Murray echoed that sentiment — because he is one of those people. He grew up in McLean, Va., as a huge fan of the team. His family had season tickets and named their dog after linebacker LaVar Arrington. But on trips home over the past decade, Murray has hated the long drive to FedEx Field and the relative lack of life around it. In contrast, he loves the easy metro to Nationals Park and running into old friends at nearby bars before and after ballgames. If Harris really wants to give his team a home-field advantage, Murray said it matters whether he puts the new stadium in D.C., Maryland or Virginia. “They have to go back to having a stadium in D.C.,” Murray said, adding, “If we could go back to the old RFK days with the crowd rocking and the bleachers shaking? I mean … that’s worth a couple of points.” Earlier this season, the DMV flashed some of its old passion for the team. Fans packed training camp, as many as 10,000 some days. In early September, limited partner Mitchell Rales said at an economic forum that the Commanders were expecting a sellout home opener — with few fans from the visiting Arizona Cardinals. “There’s going to be close to 60,000 fans that are rooting for one team,” he said. “These players have never seen that. That could be worth a victory or two to us at home this year, where our home record in years past is generally worse … than it was on the road. We need everybody to step up and help, and our commitment in return is to continue to reinvest in the franchise.” But after beating Arizona, Washington lost its next six home games. A team spokesperson said every game has sold out, and the Dallas game is “trending toward” a sellout as well. But after the Chicago Bears thrashed the Commanders in Week 5, the crowds haven’t been as strong for the home team. In November, Harris went to Seattle for the Commanders’ loss to the Seahawks. He saw how the famously loud home crowd hollered when Commanders quarterback Sam Howell tried to call plays and hushed up when it was Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith. “It was an edge, right?” he said not long after at a sports business conference. For now, Harris’s dreams of re-creating RFK’s legendary home-field advantage are on hold. But the fact that it remains a possibility — even an outside possibility — is part of why he’s here in the first place. “I understand this [fan base] is a sleeping giant,” he told The Washington Post in July. “That inherent knowledge is how I could be in this situation now. Because let’s face it, we paid the largest price ever for U.S. sports team. That’s just the reality of it. And we did that because we ... believe if we do our jobs, and it’s on us, the city will come back, and the community will come back.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3WLMFRSFQI63IGWIFJJTP7L2U_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3WLMFRSFQI63IGWIFJJTP7L2U_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3WLMFRSFQI63IGWIFJJTP7L2U_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3WLMFRSFQI63IGWIFJJTP7L2U_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3WLMFRSFQI63IGWIFJJTP7L2U_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J3WLMFRSFQI63IGWIFJJTP7L2U_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/commanders-nfl-home-field-advantage/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 07:00:00,
"Financial information from the D.C. Housing Authority was wrongly excluded from the District’s most recent financial statements, according to a report by the Office of the D.C. Auditor that was issued Thursday over objections from the city’s top fiscal official. The omission of information about the housing authority — which the auditor says should be considered a unit of city government — exposes the District to legal risk under federal securities law, said D.C. Auditor Kathleen Patterson. And it shows a lack of reporting rigor that makes her nervous, she added in an interview. Financial information from the D.C. Housing Authority was wrongly excluded from the District’s most recent financial statements, according to a report by the Office of the D.C. Auditor that was issued Thursday over objections from the city’s top fiscal official. The omission of information about the housing authority — which the auditor says should be considered a unit of city government — exposes the District to legal risk under federal securities law, said D.C. Auditor Kathleen Patterson. And it shows a lack of reporting rigor that makes her nervous, she added in an interview. “We could get a black eye, our great bond rating could be threatened — there are things that could be harmful to the District’s financial status,” she said. “And the reason for pointing out that risk is to address it before anything like that happens.” The city’s chief financial officer, Glen Lee, disagreed with the auditor’s report, saying in a written reply that he saw “no basis” to follow its recommendations. He said the city’s independent auditing firm had reviewed the housing authority’s relationship to the city and agreed. The auditor’s report spotlights a problem for the housing authority. The agency, which remains under enhanced federal scrutiny following a damning report in 2022 still has not completed a HUD-mandated, audited accounting of its books beyond those of fiscal year 2021, which it finished last month. State and local governments are generally required by law to publish annual, audited financial statements, which in addition to providing information to federal agencies give insight to bond buyers and others into governments’ fiscal health. The housing authority’s new executive director, Keith Pettigrew, told the agency’s stabilization and reform board last month that he hoped to finish its 2022 report early this year, and its 2023 financials soon after that. “My goal is to get all that because HUD is breathing down my neck,” Pettigrew said. “So we’re going to bring in some more help.” Alison Burdo, a spokesperson for the authority, said the new administration could not say why the agency fell behind on its 2021 and 2022 reports, but she said its understaffed finance department has faced a challenging software conversion. Pettigrew,   in November, inherited an agency accused by federal authorities of allowing its public housing stock to fall into unacceptable disrepair, among dozens of other shortcomings related to poor leadership and mismanagement. He is tasked with overseeing the agency’s continuing responses to urgent directives issued in September 2022 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The D.C. Council also has increased its focus on the agency, which serves about 30,000 households through housing vouchers, traditional public housing properties, and mixed-finance developments. Last year the council passed legislation beefing up the agency’s financial reporting requirements, mandating that statements audited by D.C.’s inspector general be submitted within four months of the end of each fiscal year beginning in 2024. Thursday’s report does not take the housing authority to task for tardy financial reporting. But it nods at the issue, noting that if city officials determine “that DCHA’s financial information cannot be included because the information is incomplete or unaudited,” the city should at least disclose that inability in the District’s financial statements. The auditor’s report also circles — without directly confronting — the   that hung in the air last year and in 2022, as Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) led a successful effort to replace the Housing Authority’s board. At issue was how much independence the agency has from Bowser’s office and who is ultimately responsible for its successes and failures. The housing authority was administered by the mayor’s office until the 1990s. But after HUD deemed it the poorest-performing authority in the nation, and after a lawsuit by advocates for the homeless, a judge turned the agency over to a receiver. The federal receiver, David I. Gilmore, later brought Pettigrew on board to assist in the turnaround, and Pettigrew went on to hold multiple senior-level positions at the agency in the early 2000s, after the D.C. Council turned the agency over to “an independent authority.” That independence, however, has long been in question, with Bowser, like her predecessors, appointing a majority of DCHA’s board members. She at times has distanced herself from its performance, but in recent years has taken a more visible role in trying to steer its fortunes. In late 2022, after the scathing report from HUD,   successful legislation to turn the authority’s governance over to a temporary reform board appointed by her. Bowser’s office noted Thursday in response to a request for comment that her administration has made significant financial investments in public housing and asked the Office of the Chief Financial Officer to evaluate the authority’s properties to guide those investments. “All of those actions are a reflection of this Administration’s sense of responsibility and commitment to improving DCHA and improving access to safe and affordable housing,” said a statement sent by Susana Castillo, a spokesperson for Bowser. In the wake of the authority’s governance change, District finance officials reassessed whether the housing authority should be considered a “component unit” of District government — concluding as officials had previously that it didn’t. Patterson argues that the decision — which meant the authority did not need to be included in city financial statements — failed to adhere to government accounting standards. This, she said, could threaten the city’s strong bond rating,   by Moody’s Investors Service. The subsidies the city provides the authority warrant its inclusion, Patterson said. Her report notes, among other financial infusions, capital allotments from the District totaling $151.8 million between fiscal years 2021 and 2023. “And yet [the city] does not want in financial statements to acknowledge that relationship,” Patterson said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUDFIMEW74DPTMZHD46DDPEUXE.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUDFIMEW74DPTMZHD46DDPEUXE.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUDFIMEW74DPTMZHD46DDPEUXE.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUDFIMEW74DPTMZHD46DDPEUXE.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUDFIMEW74DPTMZHD46DDPEUXE.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZUDFIMEW74DPTMZHD46DDPEUXE.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/05/dcha-audit-dc-government/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 06:00:00,
"Former Pro Bowl running back Dalvin Cook plans to sign with the Baltimore Ravens, a person familiar with the deliberations confirmed.

The move will provide the Ravens, who already have the NFL’s best record and have secured the AFC’s top seed, another backfield option for the postseason. The Ravens did not immediately announce the move. Cook, 28, cleared waivers Thursday after the New York Jets released him Tuesday. He spent his first six NFL seasons with the Minnesota Vikings and was a four-time Pro Bowl selection. The Ravens are expected to sign Cook initially to their practice squad, but they could elevate him to the roster at some point. The team has two running backs, J.K. Dobbins and Keaton Mitchell, on injured reserve. Dobbins suffered a season-ending torn Achilles’ tendon during the Ravens’ opening victory over the Houston Texans in September. Mitchell’s rookie season was cut short when he tore the ACL in his left knee during a win last month over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Cook joins a tailback mix that includes Gus Edwards, Justice Hill and Melvin Gordon. Quarterback Lamar Jackson is the Ravens’ leading rusher with 821 yards. Edwards has rushed for 762 yards and ranks fifth in the NFL in rushing touchdowns with 13. The Ravens won their past six games to improve to 13-3. They   with Sunday’s 56-19 triumph over the Miami Dolphins in Baltimore. They will have the AFC’s lone postseason bye and home-field advantage through the AFC championship game if they advance that far. They are the AFC’s No. 1 seed for the first time since the 2019 season, when they lost a divisional-round game at home to the Tennessee Titans. They are seeking the franchise’s first Super Bowl title since the 2012 season. With the top seed in hand, Coach John Harbaugh announced Wednesday that Jackson, the league MVP favorite, will sit out Saturday’s regular season finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Baltimore. Cook had only 67 carries in 15 games this season for the Jets. He also had 15 catches. Cook was in uniform but did not play in the Jets’ defeat last Thursday night to the Cleveland Browns. The Jets released him Tuesday, with Cook facilitating the move by reportedly agreeing to rework his contract to surrender the remaining guaranteed money due to him. No other team claimed Cook off waivers. There had been speculation about interest by the Dallas Cowboys. Cook topped 1,100 rushing yards in four straight seasons for the Vikings. He ran for a career-high 1,557 yards in 2020. The Vikings released him in June, and he signed a one-year deal   worth $7 million, including $5.8 million in guaranteed money.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZK2T6Z6XG7KRV2QEZRJICSM26M_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZK2T6Z6XG7KRV2QEZRJICSM26M_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZK2T6Z6XG7KRV2QEZRJICSM26M_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZK2T6Z6XG7KRV2QEZRJICSM26M_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZK2T6Z6XG7KRV2QEZRJICSM26M_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZK2T6Z6XG7KRV2QEZRJICSM26M_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/dalvin-cook-signs-ravens/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 19:13:00,
"RICHMOND — Civil rights attorney Leslie Mehta announced Thursday that she is seeking the Democratic nomination in Virginia’s 1st Congressional District, with hopes of taking on Rep. Rob Wittman, a veteran Republican, in November. Mehta, 46, a former lead attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, is the second Democrat to enter the June 18 primary, behind Herb Jones, a retired Army colonel and former New Kent County treasurer who lost to Wittman in 2022. RICHMOND — Civil rights attorney Leslie Mehta announced Thursday that she is seeking the Democratic nomination in Virginia’s 1st Congressional District, with hopes of taking on Rep. Rob Wittman, a veteran Republican, in November. Mehta, 46, a former lead attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, is the second Democrat to enter the June 18 primary, behind Herb Jones, a retired Army colonel and former New Kent County treasurer who lost to Wittman in 2022. Wittman, 64, has represented the district since 2007, although the boundaries have shifted over time. The reliably red district, which once took in vast rural areas stretching from the Eastern Shore to the outskirts of Charlottesville, shifted with the most recent redistricting to include blue-leaning portions of suburban Richmond that lifted Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) to victory in 2018 and 2020, when they were part of the 7th District. Democrats say the new, more compact 1st District — still ranked “leans Republican” by the nonpartisan   — could be within reach, although Wittman cruised to reelection on the new map in 2022, taking nearly 57 percent of the vote after vastly outraising Jones ($956,000 to $36,717). “He’s aligned himself with President Trump and extremists instead of his constituents,” Mehta said, referring to Wittman in an interview with The Washington Post on Wednesday night, on the eve of her announcement. She accused Wittman of “subverting democracy” by voting against the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. She also criticized his opposition to   rights and his vote in December 2022 against the  , which would have required all states to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages. “I think that the district is changing, and I think he’s simply not keeping up,” said Mehta, noting that her own marriage is interracial; she is Black, and her husband’s ancestry is Indian. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, Wittman and 125 other House Republicans endorsed a lawsuit brought by Texas to void the election results in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin — all states Trump won in 2016 but lost in 2020. Wittman has said he signed onto an amicus brief because wanted the U.S. Supreme Court to answer the ""purely constitutional question” of whether state election laws and procedures could be changed without legislative approval. Wittman has called the  , 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol a “senseless attack perpetrated by misguided individuals,"" but he also voted that day against certifying electors from Pennsylvania. He has said he was objecting to “unconstitutional changes to the administration of the 2020 general election."" “Congressman Wittman has never made an assertion that the 2020 election was stolen, or that there was fraud at a level that would have overturned the election results,” Wittman spokeswoman Julianne Heberlein said Thursday. She also called the Respect for Marriage Act a “partisan political bill” that would have done nothing to change marriage rights. “All marriages, including interracial marriage, have been protected in Virginia for years,” she said. “Congressman Wittman believes this is long-settled law, and he admires that fellow Virginians Mildred and Richard Loving helped secure the right [to interracial marriage] for all Americans nearly 60 years ago.” The Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in a 2015 ruling. But a defunct ban on those unions in the Virginia Constitution would become operative again if the Supreme Court were to reverse itself. Mehta grew up in Woodland, N.C., the daughter of a corrections officer and a social worker in a rural town without a single stop light. She graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then Howard University School of Law. This is her first bid for elective office. She and her husband live in Chesterfield, south of Richmond, and have a 4-year-old daughter, Blair. In 2021, the couple lost their 5-year-old daughter, Brooke, to  , a rare neurological disorder. Mehta is chief of staff and counsel to the CEO of the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Authority but has taken a leave from that post to run for Congress. In her previous role, as legal director of the ACLU of Virginia, Mehta said she championed constitutional rights for all Virginians, regardless of their political beliefs. Mehta said she is proud to have been appointed to leadership positions by governors from both parties. From 2019 to 2021, she served on the Commission to Examine Racial and Economic Inequity under Gov. Ralph Northam (D). Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) appointed her last year to serve on his Rare Disease Council. Although she worked on disability rights with the ACLU, Mehta said advocating for Brooke’s medical treatment and insurance coverage was still daunting. She recalled getting help a few years ago from her state senator, Glen Sturtevant (R-Chesterfield), after she was denied Medicaid coverage. As a board member of the International Rett Syndrome Foundation, Mehta said she has met with federal lawmakers on both sides of the aisle while advocating for medical research. “It’s as nonpartisan as it gets, funding to get treatment for sick kids,” she said, adding that she would take that approach with her to Washington.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKK7UV5F55SCVNPUILZ35C3D3A.jpeg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKK7UV5F55SCVNPUILZ35C3D3A.jpeg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKK7UV5F55SCVNPUILZ35C3D3A.jpeg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKK7UV5F55SCVNPUILZ35C3D3A.jpeg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKK7UV5F55SCVNPUILZ35C3D3A.jpeg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKK7UV5F55SCVNPUILZ35C3D3A.jpeg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/04/wittman-congress-virginia-mehta-jones/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 19:26:00,

In Cleveland, where the Browns have secured the AFC’s fifth seed, Joe Flacco will rest his nearly 39-year-old bones, giving way to Jeff Driskel as the Browns become the sixth team in NFL history to start five quarterbacks in a season and join the 1984 Bears as the only teams to qualify for the postseason with five different starters at quarterback. (Three teams did so during the 1987 strike season.) Here’s a look at some other interesting facts entering Week 18.  Baltimore has cut a swath of destruction against some of the NFL’s best teams, going 4-1 against 11- and 12-win teams and averaging a 27-point margin of victory in those wins. One of its three losses was to Pittsburgh by seven points in October.  Rookie C.J. Stroud has averaged 274.6 passing yards per game and has had six games of 300 or more yards (with 20 touchdowns and five interceptions).  Tampa Bay QB Baker Mayfield turned out to be a $4 million bargain as a starter after being used for temp duty by the Panthers and Rams last season. He is 12th in the league in passing yards (3,598) and a big reason Tampa Bay is trying to win a third consecutive NFC South division title.  Locked into the AFC’s No. 5 seed, the Browns must decide how many of and for how long their other starters will play ahead of wild-card weekend.  Green Bay put up 470 total yards and 33 points against Minnesota, which allowed 30 or more points for the second straight week. The Vikings also had zero sacks, the first time this season they had been shut out in that category.  In six of the weekend’sl 16 games, teams have little beyond pride on the line, but this matchup is intriguing because of  , not that he’s giving any clues. If he were to do that, he’d “put it out there on Twitter and MyFace,” he joked.  Derek Carr has thrown two or more touchdown passes in four consecutive games, the longest streak by a Saints QB since Drew Brees’s five games in 2019-20. He has completed 10 of 13 passes on third down for 95 yards and a touchdown.  Jacksonville linebacker Josh Allen is having his first double-digit sack season (fifth in the league with 13½) since he was a rookie in 2019. He also has 55 tackles, 27 pressures, two forced fumbles and an interception.  Arizona has gained some clarity for its draft plans, at least as far as Coach Jonathan Gannon is concerned. He declared Kyler Murray “our franchise quarterback” with the team 3-4 since Murray returned from injury.  Green Bay, which needs only a victory to qualify for the playoffs, must get it against a division rival that, while eliminated from playoff contention, has won five of its last seven games behind Justin Fields and owns a defense that has been dominant since the arrival of Montez Sweat in a trade. It’s good to be the Bears, who hold the top pick in the NFL draft.  After leading the NFL in total yards and scoring last season, Kansas City’s offense continues to sputter. Against Cincinnati, it scored on seven drives, but only one resulted in anything more significant than a field goal. Defense remains the team’s strength, ranking second in yards and scoring allowed.  While 20 teams remain in contention for the postseason — tied for the most with one week remaining since there were 22 in 1982 — these are not two of them.  Philadelphia has not won by more than one score since beating Miami the week before Halloween and has allowed an average of 31 points over the last five games (after allowing an average of 22.4 in the previous 11). On the other side of the ball, receiver A.J. Brown has had only one touchdown catch in the last seven games.  The Rams appeared to be headed nowhere when they were 3-6 at midseason. Since then, they’ve lost only in an overtime shootout with the Ravens. Two of Sean McVay’s most important players on offense have been running back Kyren Williams (the 164th pick in the 2022 draft) and wide receiver Puka Nacua (the 177th pick in the 2023 draft).  Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb saved the offense, which couldn’t muster much yardage with running plays, against Detroit. Tony Pollard had only 49 yards (with the longest run covering 18 yards) on 18 carries and was booed at times by the AT&T Stadium crowd.  The Dolphins’ pass rush has taken a hit with the loss of Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb, and they’ve slipped from being 9-3 on Dec. 3 with a three-game lead over the Bills in the AFC East. But a victory would give Miami its first AFC East title since 2008 and a top two AFC seed for the first time since 1992 as well as its first 12-win season since 1990. Drama for Game 272 … If the   and   win, and the  -  game does not end in a tie, it’s all-or-nothing for the   on Sunday night in Miami:  Win, and Buffalo wins the AFC East and gets the #2 seed in the playoffs.  Lose, and Buffalo is eliminated.

"EILON, Israel — For years, David Shtift tried to convince the Israeli army that Hezbollah militants, a mile away in Lebanon, would make good on their threats to attack Israel. Shtift and his neighbors said they saw Hezbollah special forces massing along the border and establishing lookout posts in structures allegedly built for environmental protection. Sometimes, they heard what sounded like the digging of underground tunnels. The army claimed Israel’s enemies were deterred, its borders impenetrable. EILON, Israel — For years, David Shtift tried to convince the Israeli army that Hezbollah militants, a mile away in Lebanon, would make good on their threats to attack Israel. Shtift and his neighbors said they saw Hezbollah special forces massing along the border and establishing lookout posts in structures allegedly built for environmental protection. Sometimes, they heard what sounded like the digging of underground tunnels. The army claimed Israel’s enemies were deterred, its borders impenetrable. But the kibbutz, unwilling to take chances, rounded up funds and drafted contingency plans — buying long guns for its 25-member local defense unit, securing emergency sources for water and electricity and building a military clinic. On Oct. 7, when thousands of fighters led by   — the Gaza-based militant group with increasingly close ties to Hezbollah — breached Israel’s southern border, slaughtering 1,200 people and taking 240 more hostage, Shtift sensed, bitterly, that Eilon residents had been right to worry. “What happened in the south was exactly what we were saying could happen here, and still could,” said Shtift. “It’s real.” At least 70,000 Israelis from the northern border have evacuated their homes in the wake of the attack, turning the area — like the devastated south — into a closed military zone. Several Israeli battalions, comprising thousands of soldiers, have moved in. Across the border, Hezbollah fighters trade fire. This is not an official war zone. Yet explosions from Israeli artillery and Hezbollah missiles echo across the rock-strewn mountains nearly every day. Israel’s military says Hezbollah has used short-range mortars, Russian “Kornet” antitank missiles and thermobaric bombs to destroy homes in the Israeli kibbutzim. More than 120 Hezbollah fighters and at least 20 civilians, including  , have been killed in Lebanon. Twelve soldiers and five civilians have been killed on the Israeli side. On Tuesday, a suspected Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed Saleh Arouri, a senior Hamas official who helped the group nurture its ties with Hezbollah and was designated by the United States as a “global terrorist.” The strike heightened   that the skirmishes along this volatile borderland could explode into all-out war. Hezbollah, unlike Hamas, is regarded by Israel as a proper army with sophisticated training and an arsenal of some 150,000 missiles. Many Israelis fear that their government is, once again, underestimating a deadly threat. Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader,   in a speech Wednesday that retaliation for Arouri’s assassination was coming. And if Israel were to wage war on Lebanon, he said, it would be “very, very, very costly.” Moshe Davidovich, the head of a local council who sent 40,000 people packing even before the official evacuation order came in, said many residents saw the battle on the northern front as a fight for their homes. But they struggled, he said, with where they would live and how they would get their children to school. And they didn’t trust their “nongovernment” in Jerusalem, where leaders are “consumed with politics and tactics — no strategy,” Davidovich said. For the unprecedented number of Israeli evacuees, from north and south, the state has seemed largely absent. It took weeks for authorities to facilitate hotel stays and rental agreements. And northerners have been given few answers about the state of their homes or a timeline for when they will be able to return. Israel’s government may again be relying on “the illusion that agreements can be made with our enemy,” said Davidovich, before pausing to take a call from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. “Until Oct. 6, we were seen as the sheriff of the Middle East. After Oct. 7, we are being viewed as having lost our capability to deter,” he said. “There is no question for us but to regain that.” Israel is negotiating with the Lebanese government and representatives of Hezbollah — the country’s dominant military and political force — to de-escalate the situation. But on Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Amos Hochstein, a senior White House envoy, that there is only a “short window of time” for a diplomatic solution. “We will return our citizens in the north and in the south,” Netanyahu said Thursday. “For that we’ll apply maximum power with maximum precision everywhere that’s needed.” But many along the northern border have no faith in Netanyahu, who told Israelis for years that Hamas was contained in Gaza. Similar assurances about Hezbollah will be a hard sell here. “What was before Oct. 7 can never be again,” said Dotan Razili, a reserve soldier serving in his hometown of Kibbutz Eilon. He pointed to the zigzagging border wall — part concrete, part barbed wire, reinforced by high-tech sensors and cameras that feed into monitors in nearby military bases. After Hamas used grenade-laden drones and snipers to shoot out the cameras along the Gaza border, the “smart wall” no longer feels sufficient, he said. “We fell in love with technology and forgot some very critical and basic things,” said Razili. He said his units have embraced low-tech solutions, relying on Israel Defense Forces strategy manuals from the 1950s and old-fashioned two-way radio telephones. Though Hezbollah forces have been retreating from the border in recent weeks, he said, after Oct. 7, “no Israeli can ever say that it could never happen again.” Israeli officials are floating the idea of buffer zones — similar to the one that existed when Israel occupied southern Lebanon from 1985 to 2000 — extending around four kilometers (2.5 miles) inside southern Lebanon and several kilometers inside Gaza, an enclave that is only 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) wide. Netanyahu has also said that Israel wants to control the Philadelphi Corridor, running along the Gazan border with Egypt. Yossi Harpaz, a sociologist at Tel Aviv University, said there has been a shift in the Israel perception of defense — and the role of its border towns — after Oct. 7. “The buffer zone is now in our own territory, in the border areas,” populated now by soldiers rather than civilians, he said. Oct. 7 was also a “violation of the IDF doctrine, to take the fight to the territory of the enemy.” Noam Erlich ran a craft beer company out of Kibbutz Manara, a northern community evacuated for the first time in its history on Oct. 8. Eighty-six of the town’s 155 homes, including his, have been destroyed. He sees the strength of frontier kibbutzim like Manara as a matter of national security. “If Manara goes, then the next border line will be Kiryat Shmona,” he said, referring to an Israeli city farther from the border. “Slowly, Israel’s northern border will reach Tel Aviv.” “The kibbutzim cannot exist without the collaboration of the government, and the government and the infrastructure have been collapsing,” said Tirtsa Valentine. Her mother, Rachel Rabin, was among the founders of Kibbutz Manara, and the sister of slain Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, the last Israeli leader to get close to a peace deal with the Palestinians. “Buffer zones don’t work,” she said. “And if the only solutions that are being discussed are the ones that just go from one war to the next, then we’re in trouble.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OOV5J5YDQ5LVU6SOLSBKO4GPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OOV5J5YDQ5LVU6SOLSBKO4GPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OOV5J5YDQ5LVU6SOLSBKO4GPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OOV5J5YDQ5LVU6SOLSBKO4GPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OOV5J5YDQ5LVU6SOLSBKO4GPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3OOV5J5YDQ5LVU6SOLSBKO4GPQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/05/israel-north-evacuees-hezbollah-lebanon/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 13:40:00,

That means Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) can only afford to lose two members of his party to pass any legislation, or rely on Democratic support for measures. Passing consequential bills with the support of Democrats, especially involving government funding, has greatly irked hard-line Republicans, who ousted former Rep.

Scalise was nominated by a majority of the GOP conference to replace McCarthy as speaker last fall, but he ultimately could not clinch the necessary 218 votes from Republicans on the House floor for reasons, including worries that his health could hurt his ability to travel to fundraise for candidates during a busy election season. Scalise has since served as a leadership mentor for Johnson, a fellow Louisianian, who ascended quickly from the rank-and-file to the speakership. Scalise’s office said in a statement on Friday that in December, he “successfully completed induction chemotherapy and had a positive response.” “It has now been determined he is eligible for an autologous stem cell transplant.

Idaho’s   after a lower court judge blocked a section of Idaho’s abortion statute targeting doctors.

The Supreme Court said Friday it will review a case challenging Idaho’s strict   ban, which the Biden administration says conflicts with a federal law requiring emergency room doctors to perform the procedure in some circumstances. Idaho’s   after a lower court judge blocked a section of Idaho’s abortion statute targeting doctors. The judge said the provision violates a federal law that requires hospitals receiving Medicare funding to guarantee emergency care. In its brief order Friday, the justices allowed the Idaho law to take full effect for now and said they would review the matter on an expedited basis in April. The Biden administration turned to the Medicare law as a narrow way to challenge state-level abortion bans in federal court after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority overturned the fundamental right to an abortion established decades earlier in  . The effort was seen as one of the few paths the administration could pursue to preserve access to abortion, which remains a galvanizing and divisive issue across the country in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election. The issue of access to abortion in health emergencies is not the only reproductive-rights case to reach the high court this term. The justices also will decide whether to  first approved by the Food and Drug Administration more than 20 years ago. Idaho was one of several states to pass a “trigger” law before the 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, with the expectation that it would automatically take effect if the high court overturned Roe. The Idaho law, passed in 2020, bans most abortions and imposes penalties of up to five years in prison on doctors who perform the procedure, with an exception when “necessary to prevent the death of a pregnant woman.” Abortion-rights advocates and medical experts say the Idaho law, and similar bans in more than two dozen other states, have put doctors and hospitals at legal risk as they navigate life-or-death decisions for pregnant patients and seek to interpret vague medical exceptions to decide whether it is permissible in some circumstances to terminate a pregnancy. In a similar case in Texas, the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit this week ruled against the Biden administration, saying   under the federal emergency-care law. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act was passed nearly 40 years ago to ensure that hospitals receiving Medicare funds treat or transfer patients with emergency medical conditions. After the   decision, the federal government issued new guidance to hospitals saying that the 1986 law requires health-stabilizing treatment for all patients, even if that treatment is an abortion. The Biden administration , arguing that its ban did not provide enough leeway for physicians to perform abortions in emergency situations for pregnant patients experiencing complications. Federal law protects patients not only from imminent death but also from emergencies that seriously threaten their health, Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar told the justices in a court filing. Under Idaho’s law, Prelogar wrote, an emergency room physician who concludes that “a pregnant woman needs an abortion to stabilize a condition that would otherwise threaten serious and irreversible harm may not provide the necessary care unless and until the patient’s condition deteriorates to the point where an abortion is needed to save her life."" In August 2022, U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill sided with the Biden administration and  . The judge left the state’s ban on most abortions in place. But Winmill said that because of the obligation of hospitals under conflicting federal law, a doctor cannot be punished for performing an abortion to protect the health of a pregnant patient. Winmill, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, said the decision was not about the “bygone constitutional right to an abortion,"" but a “far more modest issue — whether Idaho’s criminal abortion statute conflicts with a small but important corner of federal legislation."" ""It does,” the judge ruled. A unanimous panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit put Winmill’s order on hold. That panel was reversed in November by a full complement of judges on the appeals court who said the provision would remained blocked while the appeals continued. Idaho then asked the Supreme Court to intervene. Arguments are scheduled in the 9th Circuit for later this month, although could be put on hold now that the justices are reviewing the matter. Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador (R), joined by the Christian legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom, told the justices that the lower court s decision to block the law essentially turns federal protections for poor patients into a “federal super-statute on the issue of abortion, one that strips Idaho of its sovereign interest in protecting innocent human life and turns emergency rooms into a federal enclave where state standards of care do not apply.” Erin Hawley, senior counsel for ADF, said Idaho’s law allows doctors to care for women experiencing ectopic pregnancies, miscarriages, and other life-threatening conditions. In a statement she said the federal government’s challenge is “twisting the law to endanger the lives of women and their children.” .","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMKAPV57NE25LFGL2NU7X56ALM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMKAPV57NE25LFGL2NU7X56ALM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMKAPV57NE25LFGL2NU7X56ALM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMKAPV57NE25LFGL2NU7X56ALM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMKAPV57NE25LFGL2NU7X56ALM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EMKAPV57NE25LFGL2NU7X56ALM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/05/abortion-idaho-supreme-court-hospitals-emtala/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 18:09:00,
"BEIRUT — After a week that included a suspected Israeli   in Beirut and a U.S. airstrike in central Baghdad — sparking fears of a wider regional war — many had been apprehensive about Hasan Nasrallah’s speech on Friday. But the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militant group and political party, had a somewhat surprising message for Israel and the United States, hinting that Lebanon might be open to negotiations on border demarcation with Israel — but only after a cease-fire in Gaza. BEIRUT — After a week that included a suspected Israeli   in Beirut and a U.S. airstrike in central Baghdad — sparking fears of a wider regional war — many had been apprehensive about Hasan Nasrallah’s speech on Friday. But the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militant group and political party, had a somewhat surprising message for Israel and the United States, hinting that Lebanon might be open to negotiations on border demarcation with Israel — but only after a cease-fire in Gaza. The border area between the historic foes has seen near-daily exchanges of shelling since Oct. 7, when   militants  , killing 1,200 people and kidnapping some 240 others. The attack elicited a swift and brutal response from Israel, whose intensive bombardment of the   killed more than 20,000 Palestinians in less than three months, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Hezbollah was one of several   in the region to throw its support behind Hamas, launching strikes into border towns in northern Israel. More than 120 Hezbollah fighters and a dozen Israeli soldiers have been killed in the skirmishes; tens of thousands of civilians have been   on both sides. The violence raised alarms in Washington, where officials worried that a miscalculation could open a dangerous new front — one that would embroil Israel in a different kind of war, against a more skilled and professional fighting force than Hamas. To address the mounting tensions, President Biden’s senior energy adviser, Amos Hochstein, was dispatched to Lebanon in November and to Israel this week. In the months preceding Oct. 7, Hochstein had been exploring the possibility of resolving the countries’ decades-long border dispute. Reaching a deal was not as far-fetched as it sounded for the U.S. envoy, who in 2022 mediated an agreement between Israel and Lebanon to  , putting an end to 11 years of glacial negotiations. Hochstein sought to revive the border talks during his visit to Lebanon, according to a report last week in the Hezbollah-aligned newspaper al-Akhbar. Officials in Lebanon confirmed to The Washington Post that Hochstein had broached the topic. Nasrallah, always a cryptic and circuitous speaker, did not mention border demarcation by name Friday, but analysts said his meaning was clear. “We are now faced with a historic opportunity to completely liberate every inch of our Lebanese land,” he said in his live television address, adding that Lebanon now had the “real opportunity” to put in place an equation that thwarts any Israeli breach of Lebanon’s airspace and seas. In a complaint filed to the U.N. Security Council on Friday, Lebanon accused Israel of using its airspace to launch attacks in Syria. “But of course,” Nasrallah continued, “any talks on this level, any negotiation, any discussion, will not take place or reach a result until after the cessation of hostilities in Gaza.” Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said the leader was signaling, at a moment of high tension, that Hezbollah is ready to pull back from the brink and, eventually, negotiate a border deal with Israel. The process may take years, Hage Ali said — and would require real concessions from Hezbollah in exchange for Israeli withdrawals from contested areas — but Nasrallah was “trying to show some sort of good faith in terms of his readiness to engage in a long-term process.” Nasrallah was quick to clarify that Hezbollah, which dubs itself “The Resistance” to Israel, was in no way making peace with its historic enemy. He pointed to the more than 90 days of fighting in Lebanon’s south and praised the soldiers who have been killed in the conflict. He also repeated a promise from his speech Wednesday, vowing to retaliate for the suspected Israeli strike Tuesday on a building in Dahieh, a neighborhood on the edge of Beirut, killing senior Hamas leader Saleh Arouri along with six other Palestinian militants. While Nasrallah tends to be vague about how and when Hezbollah will strike back at Israel — “at the right place and the right time” is a favorite phrase — he said Friday that the response to Arouri’s killing was already in motion. “We cannot stay silent on a threat that’s dangerous, because that would mean that all of Lebanon would be exposed,” he told his supporters. Yet beneath the bluster, analysts detected a shift in messaging. Amal Saad, a lecturer at Cardiff University who follows Hezbollah closely, said the group is signaling to Israel that it “is willing to go all the way” toward a final border settlement if a cease-fire is put in place in Gaza. “It’s a message to Israel and maybe the U.S., because it’s the one brokering these talks and can pressure Israel for a cease-fire,” Saad said. Dangling the possibility of border demarcation was also a hopeful message aimed at a beleaguered Lebanese public, Saad said, fearful of war and mired in a years-long  . Nasrallah referred to those dire straits in his speech Wednesday, saying the group had avoided war so far because it had been “taking into consideration the Lebanese situation and national interests.” For all the hints of de-escalation, Nasrallah warned again that if Israel waged war on Lebanon, the group would fight “until the end, with no restraint.” The message to Washington, Saad said, is that the longer the war drags on, the more the United States has to lose in the Middle East — “not just anything relating to Israel, but also its wider regional role, which has also suffered a blow.” “That blow is irreversible.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ECYC7GB3Y7VGQ7GK4ZF5BAKLM.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ECYC7GB3Y7VGQ7GK4ZF5BAKLM.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ECYC7GB3Y7VGQ7GK4ZF5BAKLM.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ECYC7GB3Y7VGQ7GK4ZF5BAKLM.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ECYC7GB3Y7VGQ7GK4ZF5BAKLM.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3ECYC7GB3Y7VGQ7GK4ZF5BAKLM.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/05/nasrallah-hezbollah-israel-border-fighting/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 16:47:00,
"We ended 2023 on a sour note, at least as far as our NFL picks.

The week wasn’t all doom and gloom. Chicago Bears wide receiver DJ Moore crushed the over 66.5 receiving yards prop with 159 (on nine catches) against the Atlanta Falcons. Fellow Bears receiver Darnell Mooney (concussion) missed the game, and tight end Cole Kmet (knee) had no catches as Moore excelled. Before we get to this week’s best bets, it’s worth noting what we are looking for in Week 18, when some teams have nothing to play for. We want to focus on teams whose games have playoff implications and players with individual incentives in their contracts that could lead to intriguing player props. 15-16  7-8 Picks were made against the   as of Wednesday morning; odds that have since changed have been updated in bold type, but picks are locked in at the earlier odds.  This is one of just two games on the slate where both teams have something to play for. The victor would win the AFC South if the Jacksonville Jaguars lose or tie against the Tennessee Titans. But even if the Jaguars win, the winner of this game will clinch a playoff spot. (See  .) On paper, Houston looks like the better team. The Texans’ net efficiency   after adjusting for strength of schedule, per analyst Aaron Schatz’s defense-adjusted value over average, while Indianapolis is 19th. The actual gap between them (7 percent), based on historical data, suggests the Colts should be a slight favorite at home. Indianapolis should also have an edge in the trenches, especially when facing quarterback C.J. Stroud and Houston’s passing attack. The Colts’ pass rush ranks ninth, per Pro Football Focus, while the Texans’ offensive line ranks 19th in pass blocking. Stroud performs worse under pressure, as do most passers — but his drop in production is severe. His passer rating declines from 110.3 when operating in a clean pocket to 71.9 when facing pressure, which corresponds to a decline from the sixth-best passer out of 24 qualified quarterbacks to the fifth-worst, per PFF grades. The Bucs would clinch the NFC South title and the conference’s No. 4 seed with a win, so expect them to be plenty motivated against the worst team in the NFL. Carolina’s offense ranks near the bottom of the league in yards per drive (27th) and points per drive (29th), while its defense ranks poorly in points allowed per drive (28th). If you have access to a no-sweat promotion or boost, it’s worth exploring the Buccaneers -6½ at a price of +115 or better because it is   margin than a six-point margin. The plays above represent our best bets of the week because our analysis shows their value is the most lucrative compared with what we expect to happen on the field. Below, you will find against-the-spread picks for all of the games on this week’s schedule. However, trying to pick every game is something of a fool’s errand. The house wins so often partly because bettors try to make too many plays when the odds aren’t in their favor. Keep that in mind when evaluating the remaining games from this week’s slate. If Schultz catches four passes against the Colts, he will make an extra $250,000. He’ll earn $500,000 in bonuses if he finishes with at least six catches. Schultz is averaging 5.8 targets and 3.9 catches per game, so five catches would not be out of reach during a regular game, let alone one with extra money on the line. Targets are also easier to manage for a quarterback than actual receiving yards, another point in favor of this wager.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2O4UB53NK4ZYXFLMXNS2RHJRQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2O4UB53NK4ZYXFLMXNS2RHJRQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2O4UB53NK4ZYXFLMXNS2RHJRQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2O4UB53NK4ZYXFLMXNS2RHJRQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2O4UB53NK4ZYXFLMXNS2RHJRQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2O4UB53NK4ZYXFLMXNS2RHJRQM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/03/nfl-picks-odds-best-bets-week-18/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 10:32:00,

"With a record-tying 20 teams still in playoff contention entering the final week of the NFL’s regular season, Joe Ferreira has been plenty busy the past two months. The broadcast and digital media executive is wrapping up his 32nd year figuring out NFL playoff scenarios and tiebreakers, an expertise he developed as the league’s senior director of broadcasting and scheduling for most of the 1990s. With a record-tying 20 teams still in playoff contention entering the final week of the NFL’s regular season, Joe Ferreira has been plenty busy the past two months. The broadcast and digital media executive is wrapping up his 32nd year figuring out NFL playoff scenarios and tiebreakers, an expertise he developed as the league’s senior director of broadcasting and scheduling for most of the 1990s. “It’s more of a passion project and a hobby at this point,” said the 62-year-old Ferreira, who, despite no longer being employed by the NFL, has spent six to eight hours of his spare time every week since mid-November updating playoff clinching and elimination scenarios and sharing them with his followers on social media. NFL Week 18 Playoff Clinching Scenarios... What we already know re NFC: * SF is #1 seed w/bye * DET is NFC North Champ and will be #2 or #3 seed * DAL-PHI are in playoffs and division winner will be #2 or #3 seed and 2nd place NFC East team will be #5 seed playing at NFC South…  Ferreira inherited love for the New York Giants from his father, and while Brian Daboll’s squad is among the 12 teams , Ferreira will keep a close eye on Week 18 from his home in Florida. He will update his spreadsheets as the muddled postseason picture gradually comes into focus throughout the weekend, beginning with a pair of Saturday games with major playoff implications. Ferreira uses a computer program to help project the common opponents tiebreaker, but otherwise generates his scenarios manually. “Once we get to the last week, my job is mostly done,” Ferreira said. “I’ve laid out not only all the clinching scenarios, but the elimination scenarios, too. I share the  , which allows fans to kind of follow along as the games happen.” Number-crunching has always come naturally to Ferreira, who envisioned a career as a play-by-play announcer before being introduced to the business side of sports as a ratings analyst and researcher at NBC and CBS after pursuing a graduate degree in telecommunications at Indiana University. The NFL hired Ferreira in 1992 to help develop the league’s schedule, which was done manually using peg boards at the time, and to serve as the primary liaison with its TV and radio broadcast partners. Ferreira was also tasked with managing the NFL’s playoff scenarios based on the tiebreaking procedures first introduced in 1967. During his time in the league office, Ferreira worked closely with Santo Labombarda of the Elias Sports Bureau, the NFL’s statistics partner, to project playoff scenarios without the aid of a computer. When the NFL began including clinching scenarios in its weekly release toward the end of the season, Ferreira handled inquiries from team PR directors, who would relay questions from coaches about what their teams needed to do to make the postseason. Ferreira recalled the final weekend of the 1997 season, when the fifth tiebreaker at the time — net division points — was required to determine the AFC Central Division champion between 11-5 Pittsburgh and 11-5 Jacksonville. That matched the most number of steps required to break a tie in the final division standings in league history. The NFL’s   feature 12 steps to break a tie between two or more teams within a division, the last of which is a coin toss. In 2000, Ferreira left the NFL to become the executive producer at CBS SportsLine.com, which produced SuperBowl.com for the league. While overseeing the launch of “March Madness on Demand” and other non-football projects, Ferreira maintained his passion for NFL playoff scenarios. He created a blog that laid out clinching and elimination possibilities and answered readers’ questions as the season progressed, and he continued to consult with Labombarda on the NFL’s official playoff scenarios. These days, the NFL generates its own clinching scenarios internally and has them independently verified by the Elias Sports Bureau. As the postseason nears, Ferreira said broadcasters still contact him with questions about various scenarios and tiebreakers. “I like being a resource for those people to make sure they’re getting information out there that’s accurate,” said Ferreira, who co-hosted a weekly playoff scenario segment during his two years as VP of content strategy at NBC Sports Washington from 2016 to 2018. “The biggest fear you have doing this is making a mistake.” In addition to presenting regularly updated — and accurate — scenarios, Ferreira is an endless source of playoff-related factoids and minutiae, thanks to the extensive database he built with NFL researcher Ivan Urena, who wrote a book about the  . The league will sometimes reach out to Ferreira with historical questions pertaining to playoff scenarios and when certain teams clinched. Ferreira recently posted on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, that this is the first year since 2009 that the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC were both determined before the final week of the season. Of potential interest to fans of teams that could clinch a playoff spot with a win  tie this weekend, Ferreira points out that, while the Chargers and Raiders came close in a wild regular season finale , there has   in the final two weeks of the regular season since the NFL added an overtime period in 1974. NFL PLAYOFF HISTORY: *** With BALTIMORE and SAN FRANCISCO clinching the #1 seed in their respective conferences on week 17, this is the first time both #1 seeds were clinched with one week to play since 2009 (NO and IND). *** We have two divisions that have three teams in title… “I’m not an NFL historian, but I kind of play that role as it relates to the playoffs and playoff scenarios,” said Ferreira, whose information is fodder for those who cover the league. “I like to throw those nuggets out because I think it’s interesting for fans.” Ferreira doesn’t plan to give up his labor of love anytime soon, and is delighted by the proliferation in  and  dedicated to tracking playoff-clinching scenarios in the season’s final weeks. “It’s great,” he said. “The more interest there is, the more demand there is for factual data versus just speculation.”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUG7ZQXHEVHIXAWWJALFRRQ33A.png&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUG7ZQXHEVHIXAWWJALFRRQ33A.png&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUG7ZQXHEVHIXAWWJALFRRQ33A.png&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUG7ZQXHEVHIXAWWJALFRRQ33A.png&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUG7ZQXHEVHIXAWWJALFRRQ33A.png&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUG7ZQXHEVHIXAWWJALFRRQ33A.png&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/joe-ferreira-nfl-playoff-scenarios/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 12:41:00,
"Maryland’s economic woes predate the pandemic and “serve as flashing yellow lights for the state’s fiscal health,” according to a   released Wednesday by Comptroller Brooke E. Lierman’s office. The report, written by state economists and policy researchers, delves into the seeming contradiction in Maryland’s economic indicators: The state has the nation’s lowest unemployment rate and highest median income, but it has barely grown since 2016 as the nation’s economy experienced a double-digit expansion. Maryland’s economic woes predate the pandemic and “serve as flashing yellow lights for the state’s fiscal health,” according to a   released Wednesday by Comptroller Brooke E. Lierman’s office. The report, written by state economists and policy researchers, delves into the seeming contradiction in Maryland’s economic indicators: The state has the nation’s lowest unemployment rate and highest median income, but it has barely grown since 2016 as the nation’s economy experienced a double-digit expansion. The analysis found that Maryland lost lower- and middle-income workers to places with cheaper housing, and that a larger cohort of women left Maryland’s workforce compared with other states. The population growth sputtered a few years before economic and wage growth stalled in 2017, the study found. “Private sector job growth has been stagnant. People are moving to Maryland from states with higher costs of living, but more Marylanders are moving away to states where cost of living is even lower,” Lierman (D) wrote in a letter accompanying the report. The 110-page document doesn’t prescribe policy solutions but focuses attention on the state’s affordable housing problems and lack of access to child care at a time when Maryland leaders are scrutinizing weaknesses in the state economy. Maryland’s state government faces   from $761 million next fiscal year to $2.7 billion four years later. The Democrats who dominate the state government   to raise hundreds of millions of dollars annually to pay for their priorities, particularly a sweeping education plan and transportation projects. Gov. Wes Moore (D) began publicly   this past summer, as Lierman’s report was underway, saying that Maryland’s “economic engine does not support our ambitions.” His own economic council,   is expected to release an analysis within the next few weeks. Lierman’s analysis used publicly available economic data as well as interviews with residents and business owners to build what she called an audit of the state’s economic performance that also “illustrates the experience of Marylanders as they navigate an evolving economy.” Among the more striking observations: 100,000 women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic, most of them at a peak working age and at a rate at least twice as high as the national average. Between 2019 and 2021, 2 percent of women ages 16-24 and 25-34 dropped out of the labor force in Maryland. Nationally, these figures were 1 percent for women under 25 and 0.4 percent for those 25-34. Part of the explanation, the report says, is that industries that disproportionately employ women were hardest hit by the pandemic. But at the same time, child-care costs rose dramatically in Maryland, complicating the math for mothers considering returning to the workforce, Lierman said. Between 2019 and 2023, the average annual cost of child care increased by at least 14 percent and as much as 30 percent, the report found. “If women do not return to the labor force, Maryland’s labor pool will remain shallow, making it difficult for employers to fill jobs and for the state’s economy to grow,” the report said. In an interview, Lierman added that “if businesses cannot hire the employees and the team members that they need, then it’s even more difficult for the private sector to grow.” Among the other findings the report highlighted: Lierman said she launched the report in order to synthesize multiple government data sets and use the expertise of economists and policy workers in the comptroller’s office to help define the problems facing the state. “I believe the information that we have in the agency is incredibly powerful and fascinating,” Lierman said. “But if we don’t bring it to the public in a way that is understandable and usable, then you know what? What good are we doing?”","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WS263Q36W5456ITONRW7J6I54Q_size-normalized.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WS263Q36W5456ITONRW7J6I54Q_size-normalized.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WS263Q36W5456ITONRW7J6I54Q_size-normalized.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WS263Q36W5456ITONRW7J6I54Q_size-normalized.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WS263Q36W5456ITONRW7J6I54Q_size-normalized.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WS263Q36W5456ITONRW7J6I54Q_size-normalized.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/03/maryland-economy-lags-women-workforce/,Washington Post,2024-01-03 07:30:00,
"A former U.S. Capitol Police officer who bloodied his fists in hand-to-hand combat and endured pepper spray and racist vitriol defending the American seat of government against insurrectionists on  , 2021, is now seeking to return to the building as an elected representative. Harry Dunn, 40, announced Friday morning that he is running for the Democratic nomination to replace Rep.   (D-Md.), joining a growing field of candidates in what is expected to be a competitive primary. A former U.S. Capitol Police officer who bloodied his fists in hand-to-hand combat and endured pepper spray and racist vitriol defending the American seat of government against insurrectionists on  , 2021, is now seeking to return to the building as an elected representative. Harry Dunn, 40, announced Friday morning that he is running for the Democratic nomination to replace Rep.   (D-Md.), joining a growing field of candidates in what is expected to be a competitive primary. Dunn, who served 15 years on the force and was one of four officers who testified before the  , said in an interview Thursday that he is entering the race because he believes democracy is at stake in this election. And, he said, he wants a seat at the table as leaders negotiate the country’s path through one of the most fractured and turbulent periods in its history. “I’ve done all that I can do in my role as a Capitol Police officer,” said Dunn, who resigned from the force last month to run for Congress. “It’s no exaggeration to say that we are one election away from the extinction of democracy. And I believe that now, with this open seat in the district, it gives me an opportunity to continue to fight more for the country, the Constitution and the people of Maryland’s 3rd District.” Dunn said he was frustrated that some congressional Republicans were misrepresenting the events of Jan. 6 and were not supportive of the Capitol Police or D.C. police officers who fought to protect them. Twenty-one House Republicans voted against awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to all police officers who responded on Jan. 6. The frustration Dunn felt is part of what he said led him to consider running for Congress. As a police officer, he didn’t feel he was completely free to advocate for change or express his opinions on the events unfolding in the country — or to challenge the statements that some members of Congress were making. “I was a little handcuffed with what I could do as a member of the Capitol Police because the people that we were responsible for protecting were also some of the people who were peddling the misinformation, the lies and whitewashing that we went through,” he said. “Not being able to protect them never came into question at all. But being able to effectively, morally look them in the eye when I know they are tearing down our democracy, it just didn’t sit right with me from the start.” Dunn recounted many of his Jan. 6 experiences in his best-selling book released last year, “Standing My Ground: A Capitol Police Officer’s Fight for Accountability and Good Trouble After January 6th.” In the book he writes: “I speak out not because I want something for me but because I want accountability. I want the people responsible for that day, including Trump and anybody else who conspired to breach the Capitol and try to halt our democracy, to pay a price, just like we paid a price.” The insurrection “is a stain on our nation,” he wrote. A year ago, on the second anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack,   awarded Dunn and 13 others the Presidential Citizens Medal for their efforts to protect the Capitol that day or to fairly carry out the 2020 election. In addition to focusing on specific threats to democracy, Dunn said if elected he will concentrate on ensuring reproductive rights, pushing for “common-sense gun control” and protecting voting rights. He also wants to propel treatment of mental health issues to the forefront, saying he is passionate about getting rid of the stigma attached to expressing mental health concerns. But if Dunn is to win the May 14 Democratic primary for Maryland’s 3rd District, which includes all of Howard County and sections of Anne Arundel and Carroll counties, he’ll have to beat a slew of contenders, including several with much more political experience. And he’ll have to begin raising money immediately, something he said he is looking forward to doing. Two state senators, Sarah K. Elfreth and Clarence K. Lam, and three state delegates, Mark S. Chang, Terri L. Hill and Mike Rogers, have announced their candidacies. And there are two others — entrepreneur Abigail Diehl and Kristin Lyman Nabors, a research nurse — who, like Dunn, have not held elective office. There are two candidates running in the Republican primary — Bernard Flowers and Jordan Mayo — but the seat is considered safely Democratic. Biden won 69 percent of the district’s vote in the 2020 contest against then-President  . The district has since been redrawn. In its new configuration, Biden would have won 62 percent of the vote. The racially diverse district is 57 percent White, 18 percent Black, 11 percent Asian and 8 percent Hispanic, according to a Census Reporter analysis. It has a median household income of just under $120,000. Dunn, who has a 12-year-old daughter, grew up in Prince George’s County and lives in Montgomery County. He said he will move to the 3rd District if he is elected. Before joining the Capitol Police in 2008, Dunn had hoped to pursue a professional football career. He played football at James Madison University as an offensive lineman for all four years. He graduated in 2005 with a degree in health science. Though Dunn has not shied from calling out elected officials who he believes have not been truthful about the events of Jan. 6 and have undermined democracy, he said he still thinks there is an opportunity for reconciliation among America’s warring parties. But, he said, it will only happen if Trump’s grip on GOP leaders is weakened. “Once Donald Trump is out of the picture, I do believe there’s a way to get back to common sense and logic in the halls of Congress,” he said.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KQK6FSVXDEAYQRPP3TTGD6TR5E.JPG&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KQK6FSVXDEAYQRPP3TTGD6TR5E.JPG&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KQK6FSVXDEAYQRPP3TTGD6TR5E.JPG&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KQK6FSVXDEAYQRPP3TTGD6TR5E.JPG&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KQK6FSVXDEAYQRPP3TTGD6TR5E.JPG&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KQK6FSVXDEAYQRPP3TTGD6TR5E.JPG&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/05/harry-dunn-january-6-congress-maryland/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 06:15:00,
"When the Jaguars won the Tank For Trevor sweepstakes three years ago, earning the right to draft Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence  , it was easy to assume that by January of 2024 he’d be poised to join the ranks of the wealthiest players in football. When the Jaguars won the Tank For Trevor sweepstakes three years ago, earning the right to draft Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence  , it was easy to assume that by January of 2024 he’d be poised to join the ranks of the wealthiest players in football. In fact, many in the game viewed it as an unspoken rider in his rookie contract: Barring significant injury, a generational talent would be primed to spend the early part of 2024 chilling on a beach while his agents and the Jaguars hashed out a record contract once the window to do so opened. However, with three regular seasons nearly complete — including two in Doug Pederson’s very real NFL operation and not the atrocity that was Urban Meyer’s 2021 season “coaching” in Jacksonville — things are considerably murkier. Lawrence has had one pronounced stretch of superb play late last season, when  , and several longer periods in which his production has been frankly mundane. A sustained playoff run — as unlikely as that seems for a sputtering Jaguars team that has crumbled as injuries (including several to Lawrence) mounted — would alter the course of contract talks for the better. But as things stand now, with Jacksonville   just to secure a playoff berth out of the suspect AFC South, opinions vary as to how the Jaguars should proceed with their quarterback this offseason, and whether he’s shown enough to warrant the type of massive second deal that generally results from a first-pick QB meeting his potential. “It’s easy for me to say, but that’s a no for me,” said one NFL general manager, when asked if he’d extend Lawrence this year. (He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is prohibited by NFL rules from speaking about the contracts of players not on his roster.) “I need to see another year from him. He’s not the same guy he was a year ago. His agent’s not going to want to hear that, but I can’t pay him like a top quarterback right now.” Such conversations could certainly get awkward after Lawrence lifted his moribund franchise to an improbable playoff run in 2022. When I mentioned to the GM that even Arizona’s Kyler Murray   after his third season — as   as those negotiations turned — he had a quick retort: “What about Baker [Mayfield]? The Browns didn’t pay him, and they were right.” Lawrence will quite likely clear both of those comparisons: He hits higher notes in the passing game than Murray or Mayfield, has ideal size   mobility, is tough as nails, and is selfless and mature with a big arm. But slotting him financially among players like Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrows, Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen is a different story altogether. There has been a clear regression in his performance this season, though with ample mitigating circumstances as well. Lawrence has a career passer rating of just 85.1, with 56 touchdown passes to, gulp, 37 interceptions. This season he ranks 13th in completion percentage, 13th in yards per attempt, 17th in passing touchdowns and 19th in quarterback rating (89.1). He’s far below last season’s pace in most key metrics, with his TD rate plummeting (from 4.3 percent to 3.6 percent), his touchdown-to-interception ratio crashing (from 3.1 to 1.6) and his sack rate soaring (from 4.4 percent to 6.3 percent). He’s been on the injury report consistently for most of the season — clearly a factor. Left tackle Cam Robinson has also missed lots of time, the Jacksonville offensive line has been shuffled around and the Jaguars have had one of the least efficient run games in the NFL. All major issues. How much a quarterback with Lawrence’s pedigree should be able to rise above all of that is the question. Especially considering that after their Week 11 bye last season the Jaguars went 6-1, with Lawrence ranking seventh in completion percentage (67.8 percent), tied for third in touchdown-to-interception rate (6.0) and third in passer rating (103.4) in that span.  Lawrence hasn’t leaned on his legs as much as some thought he might, given how athletic he is, and his fumbling has been an issue. He leads the NFL in turnovers since entering the NFL (58 in just 49 regular season games), and has often held onto the ball too long this season, resulting in some poor decisions in the pocket. His 54 combined turnovers and sacks are fifth most in the NFL, keeping company with a very different set of cohorts than Mahomes or Burrow: Players like Sam Howell, Bryce Young, Zach Wilson and Russell Wilson. How much of that can be explained away by the other ills of this Jaguars offense? “I’ve seen enough; I’d try to lock him up now,” said one longtime NFL scout who has done work on Lawrence this season. “I saw enough last season to know what he can do. He’s had four left tackles and four left guards and they can’t run the offense they want to run because of all of the injuries. “They want to be empty [with only the QB in the backfield] with five guys running routes, including [running back Travis] Etienne, but that’s not them. The running back has to chip to help protect and the tight end [Evan Engram] can’t really block but he has to engage to help out the linemen, and the entire tempo and rhythm of the passing game is thrown off. “Think about the Greatest Show On Turf,” the scout continued, referencing the Kurt Warner-led St. Louis Rams offenses. “That’s what they’re trying to do on grass. You take out Cam Robinson and [receivers] Zay Jones and [Christian] Kirk, and now the backs and tight ends are having to stay in when they need all five guys available [to catch balls]. … That’s the real problem with their offense.” Regardless, it will make these upcoming negotiations more interesting than many would have imagined when Lawrence donned a Jaguars hat for the first time on draft night in 2021. The process, no matter the outcome, will undoubtedly take on a tenor a lot more similar to what Murray and Mayfield experienced than, say, Andrew Luck or Peyton Manning. Teams are lining up to begin feeling out the Bears on the future availability of quarterback Justin Fields. That market will be robust, and I suspect will further sway the Bears to eventually deal Fields and take Caleb Williams with the first overall pick. I’d be shocked at this point if the Falcons, Raiders and Steelers did not make a real push to land Fields, and he will be a constant topic of trade chatter by the time teams arrive in Indianapolis for the scouting combine in late February … If the Raiders keep Antonio Pierce as their head coach, I’d suggest that will go a long way to determining whether star running back Josh Jacobs is back in Las Vegas next season. If not, couldn’t you see Jerry Jones coveting Jacobs? … Rival executives believe the Eagles are at least weighing changes at both coordinator spots in the offseason. They’ve already demoted one defensive coordinator, and Brian Johnson’s work with the offense is worth further scrutiny as well. For a franchise that is in Super Bowl-or-bust mode, it hasn’t been good enough. … Will Andy Reid welcome a former assistant like Eric Bieniemy or Mike Kafka back to Kansas City after the Chiefs’ worst offensive season of the Mahomes era, and with Matt Nagy under plenty of heat as their offensive coordinator? Several GMs believe so. … The three current assistant coaches whom executives and agents seem most in agreement about getting head jobs in this upcoming hiring cycle are Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson, Cowboys defensive coordinator Dan Quinn and Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKVOEOPCBIFRSUP4MW46RUX6J4_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKVOEOPCBIFRSUP4MW46RUX6J4_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKVOEOPCBIFRSUP4MW46RUX6J4_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKVOEOPCBIFRSUP4MW46RUX6J4_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKVOEOPCBIFRSUP4MW46RUX6J4_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BKVOEOPCBIFRSUP4MW46RUX6J4_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/trevor-lawrence-contract-jaguars/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 13:44:00,
"D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) on Tuesday unveiled a proposal that would fulfill a long-sought request from the Washington Nationals: a new revenue fund to pay for improvements to Nationals Park. Mendelson’s legislation would create the Ballpark Maintenance Fund, ensuring a steady stream of dedicated money — with no new costs to D.C. — that could go toward repairs and improvements that the Nationals had been asking for under the terms of the team’s lease at the ballpark with the city. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) on Tuesday unveiled a proposal that would fulfill a long-sought request from the Washington Nationals: a new revenue fund to pay for improvements to Nationals Park. Mendelson’s legislation would create the Ballpark Maintenance Fund, ensuring a steady stream of dedicated money — with no new costs to D.C. — that could go toward repairs and improvements that the Nationals had been asking for under the terms of the team’s lease at the ballpark with the city. In a statement unveiling the bill, Mendelson stressed that the proposal is “entirely self-funded” and added in an interview that he saw the maintenance fund as the city’s “responsibility” to the team as the ballpark’s landlord. “There should not be this problem that these obvious maintenance needs are not taken care of right away and that they’ve been allowed to accumulate,” Mendelson said. “And there needs to be certainty that legitimate maintenance needs will be taken care of, and this bill provides that.” The Nationals support the proposed bill, a team spokeswoman said Tuesday. The proposal appears aimed at satisfying the Nationals’ long-standing requests for upgrades, signaling a firm commitment from D.C. to meet the team’s stated needs just after the failed negotiations of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) to keep the Washington Wizards and Capitals at Capital One Arena. Their owner, Ted Leonsis,   to move them to a new arena planned for Northern Virginia, a stunning loss for Bowser that has increased the pressure on the city to cater to the needs of its other sports teams — which were jockeying for city funds at the same time last year. While the Nationals sought funds for significant upgrades to the ballpark,   as Bowser set her sights on luring the Washington Commanders back to D.C. and as Leonsis sought $600 million in public funds for upgrades to Capital One Arena. Bowser and Mendelson offered Leonsis $500 million in public funds early last month — but that offer appeared to come too late, and Leonsis moved forward with his Virginia plans, which must still win legislative approval. Now Mendelson’s proposal, the Ballpark Budget and Maintenance Amendment Act, appears to closely align with the core request from the Nationals: their own dedicated stream of funds. Though he said the proposal was in the works long before Leonsis announced his teams’ planned move to Virginia, Mendelson said that blow to the city’s sports fans only “emphasized the importance” of tending to the Nationals’ deferred maintenance needs. “We made a commitment to the team we would build the stadium and we would maintain it, and we just don’t need these stories about deferred maintenance and  ,” he said. “So let’s provide a certain path that we’re going to maintain our facility and maintain it as a very attractive ballpark in the major leagues.” Under the legislation, the new fund would have three core sources of revenue, all of which already exist, that could go toward long-term maintenance and improvements: a sales tax on purchases at the ballpark; rent that the team pays D.C. for the ballpark; and any remaining funds left over in the Ballpark Revenue Fund (BRF). The BRF is a special pot of money that the city uses to pay off the municipal bonds that funded the construction of the ballpark in the 2000s. The city has been ahead of schedule in paying down those bonds, prompting questions about how any leftover money in the fund would be used — especially as other sports teams  of it. In September, Alan Gottlieb, chief operating officer of a sports business group owned by the Lerner family, which owns the Nationals, sent a letter to local leaders urging them to repurpose various revenue streams in the BRF into a “Ballpark Modernization and Sustainability Fund” — which Mendelson’s proposal reflects. The goal was to use the money to maintain and modernize Nationals Park, opened in 2008, without creating additional taxes or pulling from other budgets. Nationals Park is still one of the newer major league stadiums — only six new ballparks have been opened nationwide since. The money in the BRF comes from four main sources, according to the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. The largest by far is the ballpark fee, a tax on people or employers who earn more than $5 million, which brought in an estimated total of $46.8 million in fiscal 2023,  ; that tax will sunset once the bonds are paid off, the CFO’s office has said. The other three are taxes on sales at Nationals Park; public utilities; and rent that the team pays D.C. for the ballpark. According to budget documents, the bonds are expected to be paid down in 2027. Altogether, that roughly $70 million in revenue typically is much greater than the municipal bond payments per year, creating leftover funds. But in recent years, Bowser and the council have directed some of the excess money in the BRF to the general fund to balance the city’s budget. Since 2020, they have redirected more than $200 million, including $82 million the city plans to pull from the fund for other purposes between 2024 and 2027. Mendelson acknowledged that the decision rankled the Nationals during last year’s budget season, but he defended it as necessary at the time. He said his legislation will not change any past budget decisions but will prevent any more siphoning from the BRF for the general fund. “The council went along — it’s not like the council’s innocent here,” he said, acknowledging that the council approved requests from Bowser to use BRF funds to balance the budget. “But you’ll remember that last year’s budget was a very difficult budget, and to not have sustained what the mayor proposed would have meant that we would have to find $80 million to replace it. But this bill says no more.” While the bonds are still being paid off, the legislation directs Events DC, a quasi-governmental agency that negotiates with the Nationals about maintenance needs under the lease, to use excess revenue to fund improvements at the ballpark. The Nationals are planning to upgrade the scoreboard and the equipment to operate it as well as the stadium lights ahead of the 2024 season. Future funds would be used for other stadium improvements as the ballpark continues to age. These requests come as the potential sale of the team remains in limbo. The Lerner family   selling the team in 2022, and it remains a possibility. But the family   and obstacles still stand, though Leonsis is the likeliest buyer. That leaves the Lerners operating the team as if they plan to own it indefinitely.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QK3LSKL2NF6TFJDTBZK2IF3SM_size-normalized.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QK3LSKL2NF6TFJDTBZK2IF3SM_size-normalized.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QK3LSKL2NF6TFJDTBZK2IF3SM_size-normalized.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QK3LSKL2NF6TFJDTBZK2IF3SM_size-normalized.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QK3LSKL2NF6TFJDTBZK2IF3SM_size-normalized.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QK3LSKL2NF6TFJDTBZK2IF3SM_size-normalized.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/02/dc-bill-nationals-park-maintenance-fund-mendelson/,Washington Post,2024-01-02 16:30:00,
"It seems like just yesterday that  , that the greatest mystery of our time was   and that the baseball world was marveling at the idea of a man who had yet to throw a pitch in the major leagues receiving $300 million. It seems like just yesterday that  , that the greatest mystery of our time was   and that the baseball world was marveling at the idea of a man who had yet to throw a pitch in the major leagues receiving $300 million. But suddenly, 2023 is a thing of the past and 2024 is here, which means we’re closer to the start of a new MLB season than the end of the previous one. With just six weeks before pitchers and catchers report, plenty of offseason business remains unfinished and plenty of long-standing questions remain unanswered. Here are six of those questions. The answers are to be determined. When the offseason began, Ohtani was the clear free agent prize, the best pitcher and hitter in his class, as no one has been or probably will be again. But in the less glamorous part of this group of free agents — the non-Ohtani division —   and elite third baseman Matt Chapman looked best-in-class. A few days into 2024, neither has signed. Clearly, many industry experts valued   more highly than Snell, given that an unprecedented bidding war between the sport’s coastal titans ensued for his services. Yamamoto received the largest contract ever given to a starting pitcher when the Los Angeles Dodgers committed $325 million to him before he ever threw a pitch in the majors. But Snell is a lefty with a 3.20 career ERA who pitched to a 1.54 ERA and held opponents to a .157 batting average in the second half last year. Teams that missed out on Yamamoto, such as the San Francisco Giants, Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees, are desperately scouring a starting pitching market in which Snell, despite his propensity to walk batters and the stressful innings that facilitates, is almost certainly the best available option. And Chapman, the steady defender who contributes plenty offensively, also remains available to teams (including some of those mentioned above) that entered the offseason hunting for the kind of free agent who can change a lineup on his own. Chapman and Snell are clients of agent Scott Boras, who never seems particularly hurried this time of year. But between now and spring training, those players — as well as Boras’s other former MVP free agent, Cody Bellinger — could change their future teams’ entire offseason. One of the more dramatic developments of the offseason was the Chicago Cubs’ decision to oust manager and franchise hero David Ross and replace him with   for a record deal that seemed to signal the franchise was all-in on winning in 2024. But in the weeks since, the Cubs have done … well, very little. Few teams have been rumored suitors of more players than the Cubs, who were reportedly chasing Ohtani and starter Tyler Glasnow, among others. But a few days into the new year, little about their roster has changed. They have not acquired any big-name starters, even as one of their steadiest hurlers from last year, Marcus Stroman, is exploring his free agent options. They have not added an impact bat to a lineup that could use one, even as a key piece of their 2023 lineup, Bellinger, is also a free agent. The team that issued a record- and bank-breaking contract to a manager expected to help it win sooner than later has not added much of anything else. If the offseason ended today, something about that wouldn’t make much sense. The San Francisco Giants were one of the premier franchises of the 2010s. They have a beautiful ballpark in a storied city. They have devoted fans and a track record of winning. And they were, in the way they conducted themselves, a credible big-market team that seemed to have a chance at any player they wanted. But since Farhan Zaidi left the Dodgers to take over the Giants in 2018, they have been unable to coax big-name free agents to the Bay Area. The list of near misses has been long, ranging from Aaron Judge last year to Yamamoto this year. They pursued Ohtani. They tried to sign Carlos Correa. Other than convincing a few down-on-their-luck starters such as Kevin Gausman that they could rehabilitate their careers there, the Giants have not only whiffed on top talent but have not found ways to regenerate it themselves. Many industry observers have floated theories about why this is. Particularly this offseason, some have suggested the city itself is not desirable for reasons that are not by any means exclusive to San Francisco and are often grounded in ignorance. Some wondered if position players were wary of former manager Gabe Kapler’s emphasis on matchups and platoons, which often resulted in even top hitters splitting time depending on the opponent’s starting pitcher. It doesn’t help that the Dodgers’ stunning ability to draw top talent makes their rivals’ struggles even more glaring. This offseason, Zaidi made a splash by signing coveted South Korean outfielder Jung Hoo Lee to a $113 million deal. But the Giants could use more help, both in their rotation and in their lineup. Options, as outlined above, remain. For two offseasons, the Baltimore Orioles have needed starting pitching. The Orioles entered last winter with every reason to believe in their strong young core of position players, but they did not want to pay top dollar for starting pitching without knowing what they had. They entered this offseason with an American League East title to prove the theory that their young position players were enough — and with confirmation that a young rotation centered around Cy Young contender Kyle Bradish, rookie Grayson Rodriguez and Dean Kremer was plenty talented. But as they were swept out of the American League Division Series by the eventual world champion Rangers, they also received a clear signal that t . Their general manager, Mike Elias, has been open about the need to add starters. But other than a bet on a bounce-back for former Kansas City Royals starter Jonathan Heasley, the Orioles have not tapped into their prospect depth to acquire anything resembling the top-line starter (or two) they need to advance. Dylan Cease, Corbin Burnes, Shane Bieber and other established starters could be available. For appearances’ sake after years of preaching financial patience, let alone the sake of their on-field fortunes in 2024, Baltimore can’t afford to enter next season without having acquired someone like one of them. When he directed his front office to dismantle the most expensive baseball team in history at last year’s trade deadline, Mets owner Steve Cohen indicated that his team needed a year or two to reset. He suggested then, and at subsequent news conferences to announce a new manager and general manager, that New York could not spend freely year after year forever without developing talent from within. He told stars he was trading away, such as  , that he didn’t expect the Mets to push hard for a title in 2024, so as to give the farm system time to reset. So far this winter,  ,  , seems to be operating accordingly. The Mets have reinforced their roster but not overhauled it, signing utility man Joey Wendle and betting on a return from oft-injured starter Luis Severino. Then again, the Mets also reportedly made a huge push for Yamamoto, one the New York Post suggested included a dinner at Cohen’s home. To this point, Cohen has stuck to his plan of a fiscally conservative offseason approach. But as the rest of the industry knows well, Cohen can afford to change course — and change the course of the offseason if he does so. When   late last season, they did so because his tenure was largely defined by a lack of definition. Boston, seemingly in part because of the spending habits of owner John Henry, did not look like a team that was headed for something better, even as it was not exactly getting worse. When  , the hope was that he would make a splash, help the Red Sox climb back into contention for top free agents and establish a clear direction. But to this point, the signals remain mixed. Yes, the Red Sox reportedly pursued Yamamoto. They were not the only big-market team to miss out there. But Breslow’s other moves have been as much about subtraction — of payroll, of personalities — as they have been about addition. He traded sometimes-polarizing outfielder Alex Verdugo to the Yankees ahead of his free agent year, then acquired outfielder Tyler O’Neill from the St. Louis Cardinals, who had no place for him. He bet on Lucas Giolito, who struggled last season, with a deal that could pay the right-hander as much as $38.5 million over two years if he exercises a player option for 2025, which could yield an ace or could yield a bust. He then traded his only proven arm,  , to the Atlanta Braves, seemingly in part to save money and obtained an unproven but potentially high-end future second baseman in Vaughn Grissom. In Grissom, the Red Sox might have a piece of a future core Breslow and others hope will start to emerge this year. But they finished last in the AL East with a rotation that probably has gotten worse — or certainly no better. Snell and others remain on the market, and perhaps the Red Sox will pounce. But as of now, Boston’s direction is no clearer than it was a few months ago, and the AL East waits for no one.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7K3UMCFRHQI6ZHN5BVDATVCMDQ.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7K3UMCFRHQI6ZHN5BVDATVCMDQ.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7K3UMCFRHQI6ZHN5BVDATVCMDQ.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7K3UMCFRHQI6ZHN5BVDATVCMDQ.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7K3UMCFRHQI6ZHN5BVDATVCMDQ.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7K3UMCFRHQI6ZHN5BVDATVCMDQ.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/04/mlb-spring-training-big-questions/,Washington Post,2024-01-04 10:06:00,

Despite the prosecutors’ claims that Franco was a flight risk who had repeatedly ignored court summons and left the country once he learned he was under investigation, the judge allowed him to remain free while the investigation continues. Franco, who signed a $182 million contract with the Rays in 2021, was required to submit a bond of 2 million Dominican pesos — roughly $34,000 — and present himself periodically to the court. In documents reviewed by The Washington Post, prosecutors claimed that the mother “handed over her underage daughter in exchange for money” to Franco, and then had him continue paying her to keep silent about the abuse. The mother of Franco’s alleged victim was also arrested and placed on home confinement by the judge. The Post does not typically name alleged victims of sexual abuse, and is not naming the girl’s mother to protect the girl’s identity. Prosecutors filed nearly 600 pages of evidence against Franco and the girl’s mother, detailing allegations that Franco carried on a four-month relationship with the girl, including taking her from her home for two days in December 2022, and that he gave her mother millions of Dominican pesos — equivalent to tens of thousands of American dollars. In a transcript of previously confidential testimony filed in court, the alleged victim claimed that her mother “sold” her to men and kept money Franco gave her that was intended for the girl. In a summary of another interview, the girl referred to Franco as her “ex-boyfriend” and said that they “repeatedly” had sexual relations. Two other family members of the girl corroborated that she had a relationship with Franco and that he gave her mother money or property, interview transcripts show. Franco’s stateside attorney, Jay Reisinger, declined to comment. The records provide the fullest picture yet of a murky, months-long law enforcement investigation that derailed Franco’s career in the middle of last season. Franco, 22, was selected to the American League all-star team for the first time last July. A month later, Major League Baseball placed Franco on paid administrative leave after social media posts suggesting his relationship with the underage girl. The Rays did not respond to a request for comment Friday, and an MLB spokesman declined to comment. Prosecutors cited several alleged examples of money being transferred from Franco and his family to that of his alleged victim. Franco’s mother allegedly made transfers totaling 1 million pesos — just over $17,000 — to the girl’s mother. In addition, the alleged victim’s mother purchased a 2023 Suzuki Swift for more than $26,000, roughly three times her annual salary. When investigators raided the home of the alleged victim’s mother in September, they found 800,000 in Dominican pesos — or just under $14,000 — in addition to $68,500 in American cash, according to prosecutors, and a bank certificate from Franco worth roughly $36,000. Franco’s alleged abuse of the girl came to light after she posted online about Franco in July. She was angered, prosecutors said, by her mother taking money from him and not sharing any with her. That month, the girl’s mother filed a complaint alleging that Franco had previously abducted her daughter. Prosecutors claimed that the mother’s complaint was a ruse “to simulate concern, distress, and anger.” Franco then went on Instagram Live from the Rays’ clubhouse, claimed that it was all an extortion attempt — and hasn’t played with the team since.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICYCK7GSK6VF64UENMDEHQX56I.jpg&w=440 400w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICYCK7GSK6VF64UENMDEHQX56I.jpg&w=540 540w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICYCK7GSK6VF64UENMDEHQX56I.jpg&w=691 691w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICYCK7GSK6VF64UENMDEHQX56I.jpg&w=767 767w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICYCK7GSK6VF64UENMDEHQX56I.jpg&w=916 916w,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ICYCK7GSK6VF64UENMDEHQX56I.jpg&w=1200 1200w",https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/01/05/wander-franco-accusations/,Washington Post,2024-01-05 17:42:00,
